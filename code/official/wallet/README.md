# How to build the wallet from source

## Quick and easy way

1. Click on the green "Download" button on top right of this page, and download the ZIP archive of the wallet sources.
2. Unzip it on your computer.
3. Download the [latest Red automated build](https://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html) for your platform, rename the file to `red.exe` on Windows, or just `red` on macOS, and put it in the wallet sources folder at root level.
4. Open a terminal (DOS on Windows) and navigate to the wallet source folder.
5. Run the following command-line to compile a new wallet binary:
  * On Windows: `red -r -t Windows wallet.red`
  * On macOS: `red -r -t macOS wallet.red`
6. You will get a new `wallet` executable in the same folder. You can further compress it using [UPX](https://upx.github.io/) if you want. In such case, we recommend adding the `--no-compress` compilation option to the above command-lines in order to avoid using the internal Redbin compressor and let UPX do a better overall compression job.
7. Enjoy your newly built RED Wallet! ;-)

## Full blown installation

We assume Windows as the target platform in the following, but the steps are the same for every supported platform.

Locations used:
- ```R:\``` as the root of your storage location.
- ```R:\Rebol``` as the storage location of REBOL/View.
- ```R:\red``` as the storage location of the Red git repository or the Red binary.
- ```R:\wallet``` as the storage location of the Wallet git repository.

Steps to compile the Red wallet using the Red binary:
- Download Red for your system and save it to a location of your choice: https://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html. Please use the last automated build and check the sha256-hash after downloading it!
- Open a terminal
- The command you need to type is of the following form:  
```<location of the Red executable> -r -t <your cross-compilation target> -o <location of the generated binary file> <location of the wallet Red-script```  
In our case, that would be the following:  
```R:\red-12jun18-e62b63d5.exe -r -t Windows -o wallet/wallet.exe wallet/wallet.red```

Please wait until the compilation of the wallet has finished.
The produced binary, in our case ```R:\wallet\wallet.exe``` is a complete application. There is no installation, configuration files or registry entries needed or created. Just use it.

Steps to compile the Red wallet using the Red source:
- Download and install git for your system: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Download REBOL/View for your system and save it into a location of your choice: http://www.rebol.com/download-view.html. For Windows that would be http://www.rebol.com/downloads/v278/rebol-view-278-3-1.exe
- Clone the Red git repository of red: ```git clone https://github.com/red/red.git```
- Clone the Wallet git repository: ```git clone https://github.com/red/wallet.git```
- Open a terminal
- The command you need to type is of the following form:  
```<location of the REBOL/View executable> +s <location of the red.r REBOL-script> -r -t <your cross-compilation target> -o <location of the generated binary file> <location of the wallet Red-script```  
In our case, that would be the following:  
```R:\Rebol\rebol-view-278-3-1.exe +s R:\red\red.r -r -t Windows -o R:\wallet\wallet R:\wallet\wallet.red```

A REBOL/View does pop up and close after the compilation of the wallet has finished.
The produced binary, in our case ```R:\wallet\wallet.exe``` is a complete application. There is no installation, configuration files or registry entries needed or created. Just use it.
