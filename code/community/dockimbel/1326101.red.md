This is very exciting, but where is %GTK-WebKit.reds to be found???

It has not been publicly released yet, you need to ask Kaj for it.

It's a new binding that I started working on the same day I wrote the browser on top if it. I'll put it in a Fossil repository like the other bindings, but it'll take me a few days to clean it up, as I like to clay new projects out of a previous one that resembles it. Anyway, it's very small and minimal so far.


### @meijeru on 2011-11-13T22:00:12Z

Any progress on publishing the cleaned-up version?


### @Kaj-de-Vos on 2011-11-14T15:04:11Z

Sorry, I nuked my Linux installation, so I'm occupied with restoring that. I think I will get back to the bindings end of this week.


### @meijeru on 2011-11-14T18:12:59Z

Good luck to you, then!


### @meijeru on 2011-11-28T08:29:27Z

Did you in fact have any luck with reviving your Linux?


### @dockimbel on 2011-11-29T20:59:46Z

Kaj posted the first public version of the binding today at: http://red.esperconsultancy.nl/Red-GTK-WebKit

I tried to get it working on Windows but it needs libgstbase-0.10-0.dll. Any ideas where I can find that one?


### @Kaj-de-Vos on 2011-11-30T19:42:06Z

Those are the GStreamer base plug-ins. The binding doesn't use them directly, but it's a dependency of WebKit. I don't know how WebKit is compiled on Windows, but if it has that dependency, GStreamer must be available, too.


### @meijeru on 2011-11-30T21:25:56Z

Short of installing the complete GStreamer system, I cannot lay my hands on the libgstbase dll. In any case, more dependencies might surface if I were to install this single .dll. It all looks like a huge machinery to do a simple (?) thing, at least a thing that can be described in a few lines of code. 


### @Kaj-de-Vos on 2011-11-30T21:52:29Z

Yep, a web browser engine is a huge machinery, alas. At least on most Linux and probably BSD systems, the system supports installing them or has it all preinstalled already.

However, I do think you can pick just that one library out of the GStreamer distribution.
