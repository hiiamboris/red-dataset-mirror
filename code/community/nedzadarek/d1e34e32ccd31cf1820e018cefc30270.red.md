from: make op! func [a b] [reduce [a b]]
each: make op! func ['a b] [reduce [a b]]

keep each [x y] from [1 2 3 4]
; == [[keep [x y]] [1 2 3 4]]




each: make op! func ['a b] [
    either find [remove keep map] a [
      print ["found " a]
    ][cause-error 'user 'message ["action not found"] ]
    print ["doing something with " b]
    reduce [a b]

keep each [x y] from [1 2 3 4]
nope each [x y ] from [1 2 4 42]

doing: make op! func [a b /local arr] [
  ; arr: copy [main]
  arr: copy []
  append arr a
  append/only arr b
  ; reduce arr
  arr
]


keep each x from [1 2 3 4] doing [x > 2]


main: func [a b c] [
  print "^/Main code::"
  print ["a:: " a]
  print ["b:: " b]
  print ["c:: " c]
]
doing: make op! func [a b /local arr] [
  arr: copy [main]
  append arr a
  append/only arr b
  do arr
]

keep each x from [1 2 3 4] doing [x > 2]
