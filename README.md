# Red language dataset for LLM embeddings

This repository contains all *public* code and documentation available to date on the [Red programming language](red-lang.org). It can be embedded into the knowledge context of large language models to let them "know" Red.

This is just a curated collection made for convenience. All code and knowledge contained here is copyright of its authors. Refer to the original URLs for the licensing information of included code repositories, books, guides, articles, etc.

To recreate the dataset:
1. Have an Ubuntu or Debian server (currently assumes a VPS or VM dedicated for this sole task)
2. Clone the repo into `~/dataset`
3. Run `sudo ~/dataset/setup` script to set up necessary software
4. Run `refresh` scripts inside respective directories to regenerate needed parts of the data (if any of the Red scripts crashes, try inserting `recycle/off`)
5. Scraping gists requires an `~/auth` script with a [GH token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the following content: `export GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN=<token>` (without it, default access rate is 1 request per minute which is ridiculous)
6. Scraping issues from github requires that token listed in `~/.gitconfig` (generated by `git-hub setup`). `git-hub` produces a much more reasonable output than `GH cli` for this case
7. Scraping matrix rooms requires you to authenticate `matrix-commander`, which ideally should be done for a separate bot account
8. Some scripts create symlinks of the data (it's faster to debug). Use `~/dataset/expand-symlinks` to convert them all into files (because stupid `git add` cannot do that "by design")
