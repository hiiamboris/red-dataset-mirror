Clipping is not working on GTK currently - see https://github.com/red/red/issues/5133

Until Red issue is fixed, all clipped spaces (like `scrollable` and everything based on it) with images inside will be just black field with random artifacts.

https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces/issues/5 may also display a black window if `drawing` event gets skipped all the time.
