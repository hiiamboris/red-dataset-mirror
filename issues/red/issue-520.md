    In 0.6.1:
    
    ## Interpreter
    
    ```
    red>> all []
    == none
    ```
    
    ## Compiler
    
    Source:
    
    ```
    Red []
    
    probe all []
    ```
    
    Output:
    
    ```
    E:\Code\red (master)
    Î» test
    none
    ```
    
    @dockimbel  So, should it behave as Rebol (returning `true`), or is `none` the right output?
