Typing a unicode character (say `ðŸ‘€` ) in the GUI-Console and then clicking **anywhere** on that line converts it to question marks.

    It should be fixed by this commit  69321f7 , though it still has a glitch.(the width of the eye is not correct)
    It need a big change in the code to fix it, so I'm closing this issue and postpone it.

    do you mean **this** (after pasting the eye, and then clicking on the same line, it does not become question mark, but little bit from the right side gets cut) **or is it a regression** ?-

    @nc-x Yes. The width of the eyes is bigger than normal letter. We need to change our string length (in screen unit) calcuate algorithm to fix it.
    Also on Window 7, I cannot see the eyes, always a question mark.

    Here on win7 it is a little block containing a question mark. When I click on the line and hold the mouse button down a second block with question mark appears on the right side of the first block. After releasing the mouse button is disappears again.
