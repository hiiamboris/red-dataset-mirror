**Describe the bug**

I'm generating script from itself, trying to copy the header as is.
Simplified it's like this:
```
Red []
save/header %out.red [print "code"] system/script/header
```

1. This however doesn't work - `system/script/header` is `none` when executed as `red file.red`:
```
*** Script Error: save/header does not allow none! for its header-data argument
*** Where: save
*** Stack: save
```
2. Can be tricked by launching the console and typing `do %file.red`, and it saves the following:
```
Red [
	Title: none
	Name: none
	Type: none
	Version: none
	Date: none
	File: none
	Home: none
	Author: none
	Tabs: none
	Needs: none
	License: none
	Note: none
	History: none
]

print "code"
```
3. This file cannot be compiled now with `red -r out.red`:
```
*** Compilation Error: module not found: none
*** in file: D:\devel\red\common\out.red
```

**Expected behavior**

1. header is not `none`, but see #4992 
3. compiler should accept all headers generated by `system/script/header`

**Platform version**
```
