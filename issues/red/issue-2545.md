In Rebol `U+007F (DEL)` has an alternative escape combination besides `^(del)` namely `^~`. This is not accepted by Red when in single character: `#"^~"` gives an error; in a string `^~` is treated as `~` (general escaping function of `~`). Lastly, to char! 127 does not yield `#"^(del)"` as it could be, but `#"âŒ‚"` or some other non-printable character.
