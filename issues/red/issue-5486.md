It would be nice if for each stable release announced on the blog of the Red website, there was a set of stable binaries released too. This would be helpful for package managers and users who don't want to continually keep a nightly version up to date.

There are tags for each version https://github.com/red/red/tags but they are not mentioned in the download page of the site. At least the download page could have an indication of which build of a commit corresponds to which tagged release.

It seems like there used to be a stable release for Red with separate binaries but they don't exist anymore - see https://github.com/red/scoop-bucket/commit/e1337c2a1551c084706e17da020564dc3ba21219

Thanks!
