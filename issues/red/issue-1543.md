I would like to have SPLINE support in the Draw Dialect. Just like REBOL 3 does in this page: http://rebol.com/r3/docs/view/draw-curves.html

    We should be able to draw them using the Bezier curves support we already have, though I am not sure how to handle the `segmentation` argument.

    I guess it's "Composite BÃ©zier curve" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_B%C3%A9zier_curve
