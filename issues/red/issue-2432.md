There is a limitation under windows for the amount of characters you can place into an area. 
About 29.000 characters.
125 kB source code copied and pasted into an area is fine under OSX but truncated under Windows. 
This is tested by Rebolek

Rebolek: 
"Maybe it can’t be fixed, because it is Windows problem, maybe there is just some limitation in the Windows backend.
I looked at the source briefly, but wasn’t able to find anything related, but I don’t know the source that well to be sure."
