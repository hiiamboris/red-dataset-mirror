#1531: Newly opened window has offset 0x0 and controls are out of screen

If I create new layout and open it with `show`, window is displayed in top-left corner and controls are not visible, so Iâ€™m not able to move the window. Setting offset manually before show solves this but it would be nice if this was done automatically.

Example code:

```
win: layout [
    below
    button "Open window" [
        show layout [
            text "new window"
        ]
    ]
]
view win
```

    You should be using `view` and not `show` to open a new window, as `show` is low-level and won't do any pre-processing for you.
