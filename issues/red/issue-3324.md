#3324: Windows GUI console has problem with some unicode string input from clipboard.

When you select&copy this text: ```to-binary "ðŸ¦„"``` and paste it to console, there will be redundant null char:
```
>> to-binary "ðŸ¦„"
*** Syntax Error: invalid value at "^@"
*** Where: do
*** Stack: load 
```
The edit of the line in the console is also broken because of it.

Linux version was reported to be working correctly.

EDIT:
better test case:
```
>> to-string #{F09FA684}
== "ðŸ¦„"
>> write-clipboard to-string #{F09FA684} read-clipboard
== "ðŸ¦„^@"
>> write-clipboard to-string #{F09FA684F09FA684} read-clipboard
== "ðŸ¦„ðŸ¦„^@^@"
```

    Two unicorns = two null chars:)
    ```
    >> to-binary "ðŸ¦„ðŸ¦„"
    *** Syntax Error: invalid value at "^@^@"

    It is the unicorn face at U+1F984. But evaluating "^(01F984)" in the console gives, correctly, ðŸ¦„! Moreover, `to-binary` has nothing to do with it, because copying the face character and pasting it into the console on its own also gives the error.

    @meijeru I don't know... I just copy pasted "unicorn" from a web page to see if it works or not with Red console... and found the issue.

    This issue has been fix. I'll close it.
    The caret still not working properly, though it's another issue (maybe hard to fix :upside_down_face: ).
