================================================================================

[status.resolved] [type.design]
<https://github.com/red/red/issues/4817>

**Describe the bug**
Impossible to compile R/S code placed outside main file with `-c -e`

**To reproduce**
create two files:
app.red:
```
Red []
#include %foo.reds

view [button [probe get-pid]]
```
foo.reds:
```
Red []

#system [
    #import [
           "kernel32.dll" stdcall [
               process-id?: "GetCurrentProcessId" [
                   return: [integer!]
               ]
        ] 
    ]
    _pid: func[return: [integer!]] [return process-id?]
]

get-pid: routine [ return: [integer!] /local pid [integer!] ] [
        pid: _pid
        return pid
    ]
```
Try co compile it with flags: `-c -e`    

**Expected behavior**
Getting error:
```
PS D:\test> C:\red\red.exe -c -e .\app.red

    I asked to open this issue because though it's understandable that `-e` turns `#include` into `do` after which we lose all R/S code of the included file for the compiler, and it rightfully complains about undefined words. It raises an important design question for *proper* `#include` design.

    @hiiamboris It would be better to open an umbrella _epic_ issue to gather all the related tickets. There was an "epic" mode in Github to handle that (not sure it's still present).

    Those two compilation flags are incompatible. `-c` means _compile_ in dev mode using libRedRT", while `-e` means _encapsulate_ the Red code without compilation. Both result in an executable but using different models (compiled code vs interpreted code).

    I still want a linter for things we know are not supported or just poor practices. I think this falls into that category. In this case, the CLI can easily say those flags are incompatible. But it's an interesting question as well, because `-e` could mean to encap everything it can, but R/S elements would still have to be compiled. Saves escaping with `do` when not using `-e`.

    Shouldn't compiler complain about `routine` when `-e` used?
    
    @bubnenkoff `foo.reds` file extension is `reds` but the header inside is not `Red/System`

    The compiler is smart enough to extract routines declared in global space and compile them ahead of time, then link them to the encapped Red code.

    The following version of the above code works fine when compiled with `-e` only:
    
    %foo.red
    ```
    Red []
    #system [
        #import [
               "kernel32.dll" stdcall [
                   process-id?: "GetCurrentProcessId" [
                       return: [integer!]
                   ]
            ] 
        ]
        _pid: func[return: [integer!]] [process-id?]
    ]
    
    get-pid: routine [ return: [integer!] ] [
        _pid
    ]
    ```
    %app.red
    ```
    Red []
    #include %foo.red
    
    view [button "PID?" [probe get-pid]]
    ```

    BTW, the %foo.red code could be further simplified:
    ```
    Red []
    #system [
        #import [
               "kernel32.dll" stdcall [
                   process-id?: "GetCurrentProcessId" [return: [integer!]]
            ] 
        ]
        _pid: process-id?
    ]
    
    get-pid: routine [ return: [integer!] ] [ _pid ]
    ```
