```
Red []
obj: object [a: 1]
blk: [b: 2]
obj2: construct/with blk obj
```
Compile it
`> red -c -t MSDOS .\test.red`

```

    Note that I got different error message before
    ```
    *** Red Compiler Internal Error: Internal Error : Stack overflow
    *** Where: attempt
    *** Near:  [unless error? set/any 'value try]
    ```
    
    I changed absolutely nothing, I don't know why the error message changed ðŸ™„

    `[unless error? set/any 'value try]` I'm getting with -r
    
    with -c it's still different
    ```

    ]
    either
    ]
    ```

    Support for `construct` in the compiler is primitive, it needs extra work to support in all his possible usage patterns.
