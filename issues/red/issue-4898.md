[status.built] [status.tested] [type.bug] [GUI]
<https://github.com/red/red/issues/4898>

**Describe the bug**
```
fnt: make font! []
view [base data make image! 100x100 rate 3 on-time [print "âš¡" face/draw: [font fnt]]]
```
This crashes after 2 lightnings:
```
âš¡
âš¡

*** Runtime Error 1: access violation
*** in file: ï¿½1
*** at line: 1818845542
***
```

With no image it's less crashy but random:
```
fnt: make font! []
view [base rate 3 on-time [print "âš¡" face/draw: [font fnt]]]
```
Gui console output stops after 4 lightnings, but (it's a debug console) CLI output from it continues:
```
âš¡
âš¡
âš¡
âš¡
*** Script Error: value out of range: 4
*** Where: poke
*** Stack: view do-events do-actor do-safe error? do-actor do-safe 
âš¡
âš¡
âš¡
âš¡
âš¡
```
While CLI console still crashes like in the 1st snippet.

**Expected behavior**

Just lightnings printed.

**Platform version**
```
Red 0.6.4 for Windows built 11-May-2021/19:00:20
```
