#5106: OpenBSD Build

I am looking to use Red on OpenBSD. Unfortunately I was unable to find build instructions, only a mention that one needs REBOL. REBOL in turn does not seem to be available for OpenBSD. Any help would be appreciated.

Ideally, the Red project publishes a build for OpenBSD (amd64).
