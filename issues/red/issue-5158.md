A lot of projects enabled [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) on their repositories. For example, Neovim, Zig, and V languages use it:
- https://github.com/sponsors/neovim
- https://github.com/sponsors/ziglang
- https://github.com/sponsors/medvednikov (a personal account, for V language)

Quite often these are combined with the corresponding [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/) account as a [means to collect the donation](https://opencollective.com/github-sponsors).

    Found this weird page https://www.red-lang.org/p/donations.html linked from the wiki. Still valid creds?

    No, it's not valid anymore. We are still looking in how to setup a suitable bank account to be able to use Github Sponsors program.
