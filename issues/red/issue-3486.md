### Expected behavior
`curv` after another `curv` should join smoothly.
### Actual behavior
Second `curv` joins in sharp angle.
### Steps to reproduce the problem
Problem is at 6th point below:
```
view [
   at 0x0 box 500x500 draw [
      shape [
         move 0x250 
         curve 50x100 100x300 150x250 
         curv 250x300 300x250 
         curv 400x300 450x250 
         move 0x250
      ] 
      text 10x240 "1" circle 0x250 4 
      text 60x90 "2" circle 50x100 4 
      text 110x290 "3" circle 100x300 4 
      text 160x240 "4" circle 150x250 4 
      text 260x290 "5" circle 250x300 4 
      text 310x240 "6" circle 300x250 4 
      text 410x290 "7" circle 400x300 4 
      text 460x240 "8" circle 450x250 4
   ]
]
```
[![bezier-bug](http://vooglaid.ee/red/smooth-bezier-bug.png)](http://vooglaid.ee/red/smooth-bezier-bug.png)
However, at point 4 `curv` joins smoothly to the preceding `curve`.
Same is true for `'curv`:
```
view [
   at 0x0 box 500x500 
   draw [
      shape [
         move 0x250 
         'curve 50x-150 100x50 150x0 
         'curv 100x50 150x0 
         'curv 100x50 150x0 
         move 0x250
      ] 
      text 10x240 "1" circle 0x250 4 
      text 60x90 "2" circle 50x100 4 
      text 110x290 "3" circle 100x300 4 
      text 160x240 "4" circle 150x250 4 
      text 260x290 "5" circle 250x300 4 
      text 310x240 "6" circle 300x250 4 
      text 410x290 "7" circle 400x300 4 
      text 460x240 "8" circle 450x250 4
   ]
]
```

    Including graphic examples helps sooo much with tickets like this. Thanks.

    Say what you will, but to my eye it's still not working.
    
    This snippet requires [explore](https://gitlab.com/hiiamboris/red-mezz-warehouse/-/blob/master/explore.red) and dependencies.
    ```
    do %explore.red
    
    p: [0x0 3x3 20x5 40x0 50x5 42x10]
    bxs: collect [foreach xy p [keep reduce ['box xy - 1 xy + 1]]]
    i: draw 100x50 probe compose/deep [
    	; pen red shape [move (take p) curv (take/part p 3) curv (p) move 0x0]		;) 1
    	; pen red shape [curve (take/part p 3) curv (p)]								;) 2
    	pen red shape [curve (p) move 0x0]											;) 3
    
    	pen blue (bxs)
    ]
    
    explore i
    ```

    | Comments | [IMMA FIRIN MAH LAZER!!](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/shoop-da-whoop) | 1. Missed 4th point <br>2. Missed last point <br>3. Missed 3 last points | Same issues as on Mac but closes 2nd curve |
    
    That 4th point is missed can be proven by changing it from `40x0` to `40x-100` - same curve.
    
    **Expected**
    1. Consistent results across backends
    2. No points ignored
    3. No shooting aboard the spaceship

    Versions 1 & 2 still firin lazers for me @qtxie 
    
    Also `spline` draws spiky nonsense:
    `view [image draw [pen red line-width 2 spline 10x90 50x60 50x20 50x60 90x90]]`

    @hiiamboris There is a syntax error in versions1 & 2. `curv` expects even number of coordinates. We have the following options:
    1. Check it at runtime and throw an error.
    2. Ignore the third coordinate silently.
    3. Static checking by using a tool or compiling draw dialect to byte code.
    ```
    pen red shape [move 0x0 curv 3x3 20x5 40x0 curv 50x5 42x10 move 0x0]
    ```
    
    BTW, SVG also gives wrong result.

    Since the docs give no clue, can you explain why even number? I did a software cubic spline interpolation once, and I have no idea why this limitation. It should just draw the curve thru all the specified points, no matter their number.

    A cubic BÃ©zier segment is defined by a start point, an end point, and two control points. `Curv` expects a control point and an end point. The SVG docs has more details: https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/paths.html#PathDataCurveCommands

    OK then I propose:
    - throw a Draw error when number of points is unexpected
    - document the proper usage of Shape's curv/curve in https://w.red-lang.org/en/draw/#draw-commands
    - ~~fix `spline` as B-spline isn't supposed to be spiky~~ (on a second thought, looks like I a limitation of quadratic spline, since 3 points I specified lie in the same vertical line, nevermind)
    
    Also I am wondering, why don't we have a `spline` equivalent inside Shape subdialect? Not that I need it badly, just seems to me as a deficiency of shapes.
