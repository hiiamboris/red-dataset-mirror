**Describe the bug**

ðŸ‘†

**To reproduce**
```
view [box 150x150 on-over [print ['box event/type event/offset]]]
```
1. Hover onto the box
2. Click on it: release of LMB prints two lines, e.g.:
```
box over 90x38
box over 100x48
```
One obviously doesn't even subtract face's offset.

**Expected behavior**

No events.

**Platform version**
```
Red 0.6.4 for Windows built 11-Mar-2022/2:40:53+03:00  commit #27f71f9
```

    FYI, no `on-over` event will be sent to a transparent face. Actually all the mouse events will pass through the transparent part of a face. See issue #1833.
