Curently in Red/System it's not possible to get the address of a ```struct!``` member using ```:```. Doing pointer math calculation might be tedious if the ```struct!``` is large and members of different types.

Following construct would be much easier and elegant:
```
x: declare struct! [
    a   [integer!]
    b   [integer!]
]

y: :x/a
```
where ```y``` is of type ```int-ptr!```

    üëç The current system is not only tedious but also error prone in the sense that it depends on detailed knowledge of the way memory is allocated for structs. I would not be surprised if the Red runtime could benefit from this enhancement also.

    All pointers taken to struct members are `pointer! [integer!]` by default (most common case).

    Thank you for implementing this feature.
    
    I have done a test with latest sources and I have an issue.
    Source code:
    ```
    Red/System []
    
    a: declare struct! [
        val [integer!]
    ]
    
    a/val: 23
    
    p-val: :a/val
    print [" p-val: " p-val/value lf]
    ```
    
    When I compile I get following output:
    ```
    Compiling d:\dev\work\fork_red\tests\test.reds ...
    
    Target: Windows
    
    Compiling to native code...
    *** Compilation Error: invalid path value: p-val/value

    I haven't tested with latest automated build which contains this fix. This might explain the issue I have.

    Tested with latest automated build and I got rid of compilation error.
    
    I run another test with embedded ```struct!``` and the result is not as expected.
    Test program:
    ```
    Red/System []
    
    b!: alias struct! [
        b1  [byte!]
        b2  [integer!]
    ]
    a: declare struct! [
        x   [byte!]
        bb  [b!]
        val [integer!]
    ]
    
    a/bb: as b! allocate size? b!
    a/bb/b1: #"A"
    
    p-bb-b1: :a/bb/b1
    print [" a/bb/b1: " a/bb/b1 lf]
    print [" p-bb-b1/value: " as byte! p-bb-b1/value lf]
    ```
    
    Result:
    ```
     a/bb/b1: A
     p-bb-b1/value: √è
    ```
    
    Value of ```p-bb-b1/value``` should be ```A```.

    Thank you for pointing out this issue with deeper get-paths. It should be fixed now.
