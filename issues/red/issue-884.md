To the interpreter, the `Red` header is not case sensitive, but to the compiler `Red` and `Red/System` both are. So for each of the following headers, the compiler throws `*** Syntax Error: Invalid Red program`:

red []
RED []
ReD []
red/system []
RED/SYSTEM []
Red/system []
red/System []

    Now the console will do a case-sensitive `Red` header checking.

    @dockimbel This bug should be reopened. The title says **"header case sensitive to compiler"** and thatâ€™s still true.
    
    Example:
    
    ```
    Red/system []
    print "1"
    ```
    
    Output:
    
    ```
    *** Syntax Error: Invalid Red program
    *** line: 1
    *** at: {/system []
    ```
