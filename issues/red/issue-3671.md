    Works fine on Win8.1

    Should we note somewhere that Win 8.0 is not supported by the GUI console?

    I don't know how widespread WIn8 is, versus how much work it will take to support it.

    I think we can support only Win8.1 as Microsoft already killed its support:
    
    > When Windows 8.1 was released in October 2013, Microsoft made it clear to Windows 8 customers that they had two years to upgrade. Microsoft said then it would no longer support the old version of the operating system by 2016. Windows 8 customers can still use their computers.

    Works for me. Let's make sure we note that MS doesn't support it either, where we say we don't.
