This is basically #1866, but not in interpreter.

Code:

```
Red []
parse "abc" [(return 1)]
```

Output:

```
Î» test

*** Runtime Error 95: no CATCH for THROW
*** at: 0040D780h
```

    Additional fixes are needed for other exceptions cases:
    ```
    parse "abc" [(break)]
    parse "abc" [(continue)]
    parse "abc" [(throw 123)]
    loop 2 [parse "abc" [(break)]]
    ```
