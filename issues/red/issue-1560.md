I have compiled `gui-console.red` with the latest `Red.exe` and `-t Windows` under Windows 10. The resulting `.exe` runs OK but when I maximise the console window, the effectively usable surface does not expand. It _does_ expand when I resize the window.

    Is there any reason why this is labeled as a _wish_  rather than a _bug_?

    @meijeru The maximizing support is a feature we were planning to add. So strictly speaking, it's not a bug, as it currently behaves as it should. ;-)
