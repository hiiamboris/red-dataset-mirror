    `remove-each` is an iterator, so in the same class as `foreach`, `forall`, ... It does not relate to `sort`, which is an action on series, so in the same class as `select`, `find`, `reverse` and close to set functions like `union`, `unique`, ... Only in this latter category, `/skip size` option applies.
