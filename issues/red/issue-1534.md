This is a test file with messy code:

[test.txt](https://github.com/red/red/files/87442/test.txt)

It shows below in notepad++.

```
hello ? world!
```

However, the `read` funciton return a cut off string.

```
red>> read %test.txt
== "hello ï¿½"
red>> to binary! read %test.txt
== #{68656C6C6F20EFBFBD}
red>>
```

    The current `read` function expects text to be encoded in UTF-8 format.
    
    If you look at your input as if it was UTF-8 encoded it would be like this:
    
    68 - h
    65 - e
    6C - l
    6C - l
    6F - o
    20 - (space)
    EF - Start of a 3 character UTF-8 sequence
    EF BF BD - Is the UTF-8 replacement character
    
    This indicates that your file included an invalid UTF-8 sequence, hence the input was truncated.

    The test file was created on purpose. 
    
    I just think if there are messy codes, `to string!` function can hold these codes and transfer the rest data instead of truncation

    The IO in Red 0.6.0 is temporary. Such features are likely to be included when IO support is developed for Red 0.7.0.

    Should report an error now with the latest version.
