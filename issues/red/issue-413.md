When compilation takes long, short times are reported. They seem to be modulo one minute.

    Is that for Red or Red/System compiler?

    You have compilation times over a minute??

    Yep, I built this machine a decade ago and current Firefox sucks up a third or half of my CPU time when I open GitHub. It's an ideal test environment. :-)
    
    I'm seeing it on the Red/System phase of compiling a Red program. The other phases aren't over a minute yet, so I need a slower machine to test those. ;-)
