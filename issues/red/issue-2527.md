`vector!` values have an element type (`char! integer! percent!` or `float!`) and a bit-size (8 16 32 or 64). Currently the only way to find these properties from a given value is to `mold` the value and parse the resulting string ðŸ˜„ 
I can see two approaches: reflectors (let's say `type-of` and `size-of`) or pseudo-components (`.../type` and `.../size`, like with `image!`)
