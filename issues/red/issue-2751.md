According to the document about clipping regions,
> the combining mode between a new clipping region and the previous one, can be set to one of the following: replace (default), intersect, union, xor, exclude.

I wish the support of "reverse exclude", which is that the new clipping region excludes the old one, instead of that the old clipping region excludes the new one.
