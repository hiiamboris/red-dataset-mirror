%View-hanoi.red doesn't work when compiled. First disk goes up, then animation stops. Tried both with and without -t (Windows).

    In my old gui-console this script crashes on 
        Date:   "4-Oct-2001 â€” 26-Jun-2016"
    red>> do %../script/view-hanoi.red
    **\* Access error: invalid UTF-8 encoding: #{97203236}

    Perhaps it is related or it is a bug on its own.
    
    Sometimes the blocks on the left stick are cut of on the left side
    Pressing "Close" also closes console, so should do an unview, not a quit?

    I just checked, and it's UTF-8 here, but I pasted to the gist again, to see if that helps.
    
    Under the official 0.6.0 interpreter, the disks aren't colored, but the alignment is fine. I do want to align the buttons differently.
    
    For demos, do we want to quit or just unview? In some cases, with a manual event loop, we have to make sure we don't leave it spinning.

    Using latest Red Master Binary, I get this error while try to compile -
    
    ```
    Compiling C:\Users\ABC\Desktop\a.red ...
    *** Compilation Error: expected a block for WHILE-CONDITION instead of word! value
    *** in file: %/C/Users/ABC/Desktop/a.red
    *** near: [test [move-face face way process-events]]
    ```
    
    According to https://github.com/red/red/issues/2075, modifying line 94 to `while [do test] [move-face face way  process-events]` helped to compile it.
    
    How long is the animations supposed to be? I mean, for me, both when interpreting, as well as when compiled, the animation stops after about 3 seconds. The disk usage goes up to about 35%.
