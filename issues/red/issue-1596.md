If you have GROUP-BOX in some subwindow, close it and open it again, GROUP-BOX text is changed to text from its content. See this code:

```
Red [
    Needs: 'View
]

view [
    button "show" [
        view [      
            group-box "Original text" [
                field "New text"
            ]
            button "close" [unview]
        ]
    ]
]
```

Press [SHOW], then [CLOSE], then [SHOW] again. GROUP-BOX label now says "New text" instead of "Original text".

    Probably related to #1565

    Are you even supposed to call `view` from within an action?

    How else would you open a sub window?

    For me, previous builds give this issue, but this behaviour has since changed so that I get the same thing both times: It's a blank group-box with the correct text, but no contents:
    
    ![blank group-box](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7657453/12868154/6aad9330-cd4c-11e5-82c9-40e538e964bc.png)
    
    Same on both Windows XP and Windows 7. This is basically #1592.

    Could one define a sub-window by `layout` and open it by `show`? Or does that omit crucial steps?

    Until recently, `view` was initializing the View engine, but now that is automated. `show` is fine now, though, it is a low-level way to open a window, so you don't get any default features provided by View (like a default title or automatic centering).

    @rebolek The right way to open a sub-window is to use `view/no-wait` to avoid creating a new event loop.
