Together with the promised implementation of the SELECTED facet this would greatly facilitate the writing of editor facilities in Red.

    We are working on a new feature for Draw dialect, called `text-box` for now, which should be used as the base for writing editors. It does support an interface to access the caret and many features not available in current `area`. The `area` widget might be rewritten in the future using `text-box`.
