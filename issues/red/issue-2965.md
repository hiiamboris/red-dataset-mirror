I haven't found ANYTHING about this. Are these concepts unnecessary? Not yet planned?

    Concurrency will come in a future release. Rather than opening tickets for questions, please visit https://gitter.im/red/red or https://gitter.im/red/red/welcome and ask there.

    This does not resolve the issue (nor does 'concurrency'). Are they in a public roadmap? A design document?

    I closed the issue because questions are best addressed outside tickets. And this is a potentially big subject. See https://trello.com/b/FlQ6pzdB/red-tasks-overview for the current roadmap. The design is not finalized or public yet.

    Fair. For anyone who comes across this issue, the topic is 'Define tasking model', even though it's under the (possibly unintentionally) underspecific label of concurrency.
