    I have a copy of this video in HD if you need it.  The subtitles are at:

    With $500K at one's disposal, one would think there'd be _someone_ to do a YouTube upload on a channel controlled by the Red project _(vs. being on someone's channel you don't trust?)_.  And if there isn't any such person, that may suggest not being so cavalier about treatment of those who would have done it.
    
    Either way: deleting the content altogether seems a bit cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.  Just my opinion.  If you change your mind, here is again a copy of the video...or for anyone seeking it in the near term:

    This is the video I send people to whenever I tell them about Red.
