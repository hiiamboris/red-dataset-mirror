    I want to implement one before, something similar to [comtypes](http://pythonhosted.org/comtypes/) in python.
    I think it would be implemented as a lib or a module(once we have it).

    Comtypes are easy to understand. It will be very nice to have something similar

    Such feature is not on our roadmap, though, it can be contributed by anyone (including from someone from the Red team). As it will not be part of the red/red repo anyway, I'm closing this ticket.
