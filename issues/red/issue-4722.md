#4722: Flawed logic in `make bitset!` exploits emitters discrepancy

**Describe the bug**

https://github.com/red/red/blob/738c45d5ca412950325d2e00e0c08392777ad603/runtime/datatypes/bitset.reds#L567-L578
and then the macro:
https://github.com/red/red/blob/738c45d5ca412950325d2e00e0c08392777ad603/runtime/macros.reds#L548-L559

As can be seen, code does not consider a NaN float value. Both `< MIN_INT` and `> MAX_INT` checks will fail with NaNs, leading to NaN being converted into an integer.

Why I open this issue is an emitter discrepancy which probably should be addressed:
- on IA-32: `as-integer 0.0 / 0.0` gives out `-2147483648`. No idea where it comes from since:<br>
```
>> to #{} 1.#nan
== #{7FF8000000000000}
```
- on ARM: `as-integer 0.0 / 0.0` gives out `0`, and thus it gets past the `< 0` check in the `constuct` func, propagating the bug into user code.

**To reproduce**
```
Red/System []

f: 0.0 / 0.0
probe f < -2147483648.0
probe f > -2147483648.0
probe f < 2147483647.0
probe f > 2147483647.0
probe as-integer f
probe as-integer 1.0
probe as-integer 10.0
```

**Expected behavior**

I expect `as-integer` to return platform-agnostic result.

Should print (on the https://github.com/red/red/pull/4717 branch):
```
false
false
false
false
-2147483648
1
10
```
Though `-2147483648` (IA-32) value is debatable, it's probably better than `0` (ARM) in terms of early error detection.

**Platform version**

    @hiiamboris  On ARM (RPi), it gives:
    ```
    true
    true
    true
    true
    0
    1
    10
    ```
    
    It seems the NaN comparisons handling is wrong at: https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/system/targets/ARM.r#L1931
    
    Moreover, it seems the method used there is not sound, as distinction between a purely unordered result and a mix of lesser/greater + unordered is never made. The latter case is what is implemented, but fails to flip properly the comparison mode because it's not possible to detect a NaN at compile time. The `parity` flag only indicates that it's a float operation, nothing more.  It seems that a separate check for unordered state needs to be done for NaNs, so that a `false` can be returned for any comparison.
    
    It seems that a specific check for `overflow` (V = 1) needs to be done to detect the unordered result.
    
    For the record, here's the relevant ARM documentation page:

    Does `system/tests/source/units/float-test.reds` succeed for you? I don't have access to @rebolek's Pi anymore.

    Pretty sure I have tested it previously :)
    Anyway, the logic was to for floats use conditions that will return false for unordered result.
    Given:
    ```
    conditions: make hash! [
    ;-- name ----------- signed --- unsigned --
        overflow?        #{60}      -
        not-overflow?    #{70}      -
        =                #{00}      -
        <>               #{10}      -
        signed?          -          -
        unsigned?        -          -
        even?            -          -
        odd?             -          -
        <                #{b0}      #{30}
        >=               #{a0}      #{20}
        <=               #{d0}      #{90}
        >                #{c0}      #{80}
    ]
    ```
    And:
    ```
    ;; for floats only: use conds that are false given NaN
    ;; in unflipped state: unsigned for < <= , signed for > >=
    ```
    We get opcodes (note that 2 were chosen from signed, 2 from unsigned column):
    ```
    operator hex binary
    <  #{30} "00110000"
    <= #{90} "10010000"
    >= #{A0} "10100000"
    >  #{C0} "11000000"
    ```
    And their "opposite" opcodes:
    ```
    operator hex binary
    <  #{B0} "10110000"
    <= #{D0} "11010000"
    >= #{20} "00100000"
    >  #{80} "10000000"
    ```
    Looking these up in the manual:
    ![](https://i.gyazo.com/a01446cc7e94ff56f2cdd80f36fb0111.png)
    ![](https://i.gyazo.com/2c31b715736ebdc25932428e07f99e3f.png)

    ![](https://i.gyazo.com/06c7573a0e0f73bf13045d8c7e5e1623.png)
    Shows that indeed these opcodes should return false given any NaN argument, and should be used if compiler does not reverse the operator.
    
    And opposites:
    ![](https://i.gyazo.com/6b2089aa96dcd9f93d30bb7c0c1b9535.png)

    ![](https://i.gyazo.com/a63e88ecae05fde0db401ffc40923c52.png)
    Should be true when given a NaN, so they should be used when compiler *does* reverse the operator.
    
    `flip?` flag accounts for:
    - compiler-induced reversal
    - `< <=` vs `>= >` change in NaN-handling behavior
    And if `parity` is false (no float operands expected), `flip?` is disabled.
    
    Where's the bug?

    I think `0110` opcode (integer overflow, float unordered) is not related to comparisons, but rather to arithmetic (gets set when result is a NaN).

    It does pass.
    
    I re-tested your code above and I've found the source of the wrong results. It's a side-effect of compiler internal states not being cleared up fully on multiple jobs from the same Rebol session. If I compile for RPi only from a fresh session, I get:
    ```
    pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ./test-logic2
    false
    false
    false
    false
    0
    1
    10
    ```
    If I first compile for MSDOS target, then for RPi, I get:
    ```
    pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ./test-logic2
    true
    true
    true
    true
    0
    1
    10
    ```

    That's the part I've missed as I wrongly assumed that they would return TRUE even on a NaN argument. In such case, it's all good and your method is sound. üëç

    Converting a NaN to a 32-bit integer is an undefined behavior in C (and probably in most other system languages): https://stackoverflow.com/a/10366541/2081311
    
    So you get what the FPU returns during the conversion, `INT_MIN` on IA-32 and `0` on ARM.
    
    The `as` instruction in R/S has a `keep` [option](https://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html#section-4.9) which should just change the type without touching the payload (it seems to require some extra debugging at least on ARM). Using `as integer! keep` should return the same value on all platforms (provided that the same NaN is produced on each platform). For 32-bit floats only, so a 64-bit float would first need to be converted to 32-bit.
    
    Without `keep`, a FPU-driven conversion occurs  from a 32-bit or 64-bit float to a 32-bit integer (on 32-bit platforms). For NaN values, it's an undefined behavior (which can be [really bad](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10366485/problems-casting-nan-floats-to-int#comment39313111_10366541)). If we want to avoid that, we need to pay the cost of adding extra instructions to check if the value to convert from is a NaN and use a fallback code path then to return a static value of our choice. 
    
    For that, we would need in the [emit-casting](https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/system/targets/ARM.r#L944) backend, to check for the upper bits that define a NaN, use two jumps for a IF/THEN/ELSE flow and set a literal return value. That overhead will be paid on all floating point to integer castings in order to claim a well-defined behavior for this edge case. No other system language is doing that it seems (would be good to verify that for Go, Zig and Rust at least). I tend to prefer correctness in such case. Though, we could also add an `unsafe` option to `as` to skip such checks when user needs to squeeze every bit of performance and knows what he's doing.
    
    What do you think?

    In Zig, both infinity and nans to integer result in:
    `thread 20520 panic: integer part of floating point value out of bounds`
    In DMD implementation of D, all infinity and nans to integer result in zero (tested float32, float64 and float80).
    Go outputs `-2147483648` for infinity and nans (so I would expect it to be prone to undefined behavior).
    Rust is too big for me to bother trying :)
    
    Anyway, I also tend to be in favor of *defined* behavior, whatever it may be.
    
    P.S. correction: in DMD, low-level `cast(uint)` results in zero, while high-level templated `to!uint` results in an exception:
    ```

    So maybe throwing an error on `as integer! 1.#NaN` is the best thing to do?

    There is a broader philosophical question (signaling vs non-signaling NaNs, and how Red uses each in a given context, but I think there's a guiding indicator for `as integer!` throwing an error here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN#Integer_NaN

    I think so. Let it crash, so the coder may add checks if NaN is to be handled. And then the same for everything outside the 32-bit integer range.

    Strange, I don't remember deleting your account.
