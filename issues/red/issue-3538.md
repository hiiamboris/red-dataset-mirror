    W10, output expressions get doubled and partially malformed if I directly copy-paste from GUI console session:
    ```red
    >> [
    [    a
    [    b
    [    c
    [    ]
    == [
        a 
        b 
        c ; <-- WTF? Note the missing closing bracket.
    == [
        a 
        b 
        c
    ]
    >> object []
    == make object! []
    >> object [x: 1 y: 2]
    == make object! [
        x: 1
        y: 2
    == m ;<-- WTF? Note the missing closing bracket above.
    ```

    @gltewalt @9214 Does the issue still exist in the latest red version?

    @qtxie can't reproduce with latest automated build, I guess it's fixed. üëç
