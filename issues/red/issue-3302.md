#3302: WISH: in Red/System, with keyword should allow nested context abbreviation

Currently, the `with` keyword may be followed by a list of context names, but these are "in parallel" rather than nesting. The use case for that seems doubtful. To achieve the effect of nesting, one has to nest the `with` statements.

    There is an old PR for `with` in Red: https://github.com/red/red/pull/1156
    
    @meijeru, would you please post examples of each behavior, so we can more easily compare, and align a possible Red version with the R/S behavior?
