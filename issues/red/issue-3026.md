I removed Bitdefender without taking note of the Trojan name.

Bitdefender kept quarantine exe regardless of my white listing it.

Thanks

    Using VirusTotal, it seems to be reporting as clean by Bitdefender: 
    https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/105d0f7b009a802a35a636c5dbedc69e89477fd62b6ba77690845fd78d436171/detection
    
    If that happens again, try submitting a false posivite report to Bitdefender. If that's not enough, you can re-open this ticket.

    Can you virustotal gui-console-2017-8-3-49893.exe which was also getting blocked?
    
    Also crush-2017-8-3-49893.dll
