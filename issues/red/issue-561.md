    I realised that there were no same? and == tests so I've quickly created some based on the existing equal? and = tests.  Examples of the failing tests are:
    
    ```
    --assert not same? #"z" #"Z"
    --assert not same? #"e" #"Ã¨"
    --assert same? false false
    --assert not same? true false
    --assert same? none none
    ea-result: same? 1 1
    --assert ea-result = true
    --assert not same? #"0" 48
    ```

    I mistakenly thought that same? was the prefix equivalent of == but having checked the REBOL docs now realise that it is not. I will separate the same? and == tests.

    I've committed the separate same? and == tests (on the parse branch). There are a lot of negative tests for same? but insufficient positive tests. I will try to write some more over the next few days.

    SAME? is not implemented yet, there is just a placeholder in %natives.reds file:
    
    ```
    same?*: does []
    ```

    It would be better to not include unimplemented functionality. It's quite confusing this way.
