On Windows 10, if you create a window with something like`view [<some elements but no size>]` it can't be dragged by it's title bar even though there seems to be enough space on the title bar from where to drag.

Red version 10471c731a91e8c7c8ad094388682f4a2173f6d9.

    Actually you can still drag it if click the border very carefully. The border is just one pixel in Win 10, so it not easy to choose it. ;-)
