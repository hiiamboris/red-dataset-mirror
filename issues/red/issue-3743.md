**Describe the bug**
Invalid block selectors  returns none. If the selector is not the last an error is triggered but you expect none to for consistency.
Also, the returned error does not really describe what happened.

Link to the discussion here:
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/red/red?at=5c3cfabb39596c372be06b8b)

**To reproduce**
Run di code:

>> a: [b [c [d]]]
== [b [c [d]]]
>> probe a/b/c
[d]
== [d]
>> probe a/b/c/d
none
== none
>> probe a/b/c/de
none
== none
>> probe a/b/c/ded
none
== none
>> probe a/b/ce/ded
*** Script Error: path a/b/ce/ded is not valid for none! type
*** Where: probe
*** Stack: probe

    To be clear, this is not a path evaluation bug, but a wish for a different error message. My suggestion, from the chat was "path a/b/c/d/e is not valid because a/b/c returned <type>". Nenad's comment to that:
    
    > See the -path* root calls for get-action-ptr-path in %runtime/datatypes/common.reds, the path argument is null. The ending * in function names in the runtime library is marking functions calls generated by the compiler. Though, it would be possible for the compiler to store those paths somewhere (in the redbin payload), and modify those -path* functions to pass a reference to them
