If you have a `file!` with a semicolon in name and `save` it, semicolon is not escaped and such file canâ€™t be loaded back properly as everything after semicolon is ignored.

**To reproduce**

```
>> save %test reduce [to file! "semi;colon" 'ignored]
>> read %test
== "%semi;colon ignored"
>> load %test
== %semi
```

Note: `save/all` or `mold/all` works same.

**Expected behavior**

When semicolon is present in a `file!`, either use percent encoding so `;` will be encoded as `%3B`, or enclose whole filename in quotes, e.g.: `%"semi;colon"`.
