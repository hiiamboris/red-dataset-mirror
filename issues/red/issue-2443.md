I am not sure if itâ€™s bug or feature, however it's possible in Rebol:

```
>> 123''456'789
== 123456789
```

Red throws error instead:

```
c> 123''456'789
*** Syntax Error: invalid integer! at "123''456'789"
*** Where: do
```

    AFAIK, the convention is to use a single tick as separator for groups of 3 digits, so I guess it's a lexer issue in Rebol.

    I remember multiple ticks in an old (cca 1930) book, but I am fine with single tick.
