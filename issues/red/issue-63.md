Comparing a byte with an integer or another byte, the sign is apparently  extended, leading to problems for charaters beyond ~ or #"^(7E)". Thus: #"치" < 0 is true. The second half of the ASCII table is forbidden for variable names, but should it also be forbidden in character strings and thus in bytes?

    A few comments:
    
    Red/System source should be utf-8 encoded. "치" is an invalid byte! literal as it is the two characters C3 A1. The compiler should either raise a compilation error or truncate the byte! to, I would guess, C3 with a warning message.
    
    Your source must not be utf-8 encoded as currently, the compiler crashes when encountering "치" encoded with utf-8. (I will write a test for this separately). I'm guessing that in the encoding you have used for your source that "치" is E1. I believe that #"^(E1)" is a valid literal value for a byte! and inside a c-string! Though it is not a valid in utf-8.
    
    #"^(E1)" < 0 returns true as does #"^(10)" < 17 (see issue 64). I will add this case to the tests submitted with issue 64.

    Tested OK.
