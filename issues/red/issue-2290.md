I refer to the Gitter converation I had on  [October 27](https://gitter.im/red/red/system?at=581227447b15d16e55b575cc) with reply on  [October 28](https://gitter.im/red/red/system?at=58131855cff50e6c558f892a)
I am not sure about the syntax for this, since I have no knowledge of draw dialects outside this View implementation. In any case, it has lower priority  for me than the resolution of the issues I recently posted.

    We'll implement it in a future version.
