See for yourself.
```Red

    The right focal point is used in both Rebol and Red, I think that's correct. Though, the arc in Red is bigger than the Rebol's one, it needs checking to see which one correctly covers the 45Â° angle.

    See the use following code:
    ```
    view layout [
    	box white 100x100 effect [draw [
    		line-width 1 fill-pen yellow pen gray
    		circle 50x50 40 20 pen black arc 50x50 40x20 0 45 closed
    		pen red arc 50x50 40x40 0 45]
    	]
    ]
    ```

    Seems Red is correct.

    Red code for the above example:
    ```
    view layout [
    	box white 100x100 draw [
    		line-width 1 fill-pen yellow pen gray
    		circle 50x50 40 20 pen black arc 50x50 40x20 0 45 closed
    		pen red arc 50x50 40x40 0 45
    	]
    ]
    ```

    An interesting issue. REBOL measures degrees in ellipse's (arc's) coordinates, while Red measures these in XY plane. I would probably prefer the REBOL version, although both are correct in a way:
    `view [ box white 200x200 draw [ scale 2 2 line-width 2 line 0x0 100x100 box 10x30 90x70 fill-pen yellow pen gray circle 50x50 40 20 pen black arc 50x50 40x20 0 45] ]`

    I do so love added visualizations. :^) A big part of that is how Red helps us see what it's doing.

    As for the original edge alignment problem. I believe the line caps are orthogonal to the line where they appear. And it's unlikely under our control anyway. @qtxie will know for sure.
