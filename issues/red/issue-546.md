I would like to help debug this script, but can't even get it installed. I uploaded the contents of red-master.zip to the server, but when I access the site, all I get is: "Apologies but this site is unavailable at the moment. Please try again later."

Any pointers?

Thanks. :)

    I am glad you tried to deploy the Red programming language source code on a server and hoping that it will become magically a web site, we thought about adding such feature just after the remote Pizza driver and the support for [IP over Avian Carriers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers).
    
    More seriously, maybe you should pay more attention which project you are forking on Github and to which issue tracker you are posting reports. You don't ask for an hotel room when you enter a bakery even if they have the same name, do you? ;-)
    
    I guess what you wanted to fork is [this project](https://github.com/friendica/red).

    Good one. :))
    
    To be fair, I did get the hotel room at the hotel, I only went to the bakery to complain that the key isn't working. Please do let me know when that remote Pizza driver is implemented, I am very interested. Good luck! ;)
