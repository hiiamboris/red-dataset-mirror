**Describe the bug**
If one instance of a word is bound to function's context, and then another instance with the same spelling is set to an object â€” magic happens.

**To reproduce**
The script below, once compiled:
```red
Red []

bind 'foo has [foo]['WTF]
foo: object []

probe foo
probe :foo

```
Results in:
```red
WTF
make object! []
```

**Expected behavior**
```red
make object! []
make object! []
```

**Platform version**
a1d1495, W10.

    Another one:
    ```red
    Red []
    
    block: reduce ['foo func [/bar]["Definitely not bar."]]
    foo:  context [bar: does ['bar]]
    print foo/bar
    ```
    When compiled:
    ```red
    Definitely not bar.
    ```

    @9214 In your second example, the following line:
    ```
    block: reduce ['foo func [/bar]["Definitely not bar."]]
    ```
    has no effect on the rest of the code.
    
    I let you write the regression test(s) for this ticket.

    @dockimbel if what you say is true, then the "Definitely not bar." message appears out of nowhere ðŸ˜‰ I expect the compiled code to call `bar` within object `foo`, instead the anonymous function within `block` is called, as if referenced by `block/foo/bar`.
