**Describe the bug**

Well maybe not all of that, but OS freeze guaranteed.
I wonder if we can work around this bug to secure our programs.

**To reproduce**

```
Red [needs: view]
view/tight/no-wait [
    below
    b1: base 0.255.0.50
    b2: base 255.0.0
]
loop 5000 [
    b1/size/y: b2/offset/y: random 100
    loop 5 [do-events/no-wait]
]
```

Life expectancy ~3 seconds.


**Expected behavior**

Finishes without casualties.

    Just for fun ;) ... in this minimum reacting version it seems to me that detonation happens only if red box is dragged outside of the window, especially if I use a wide window.
    ```
    view [
    	below
    	base 0.255.0.50 react [face/size/y: b/offset/y - 20]
    	b: base 255.0.0 loose
    ]
    ```

    No problem when running inside Windows sandbox. So it seems like an issue with the hardware acceleration.

    In this version detonation happens as soon as you resize the window, so it could be useful if the authors use a way to log the debug output to a file to see when it happens.

    The problem arises also for `rich-text` probably because it also accepts transparency :(

    Only `rich-text` and `base` are drawn by D2D.

    It seems that drawing too fast will crash D2D. Limit the refresh rate to 60 FPS, no freeze anymore on my Win11.

    A kludge, no? :)

    Yes. Just tried on a laptop, works well.
