#5504: WISH: DRAW command PEN should have option DOTTED

At the moment, the effect of a dotted line can only be achieved by constructing a pattern. A dotted line as indication for (partial) invisibility is common enough to be more easily achievable.

    On first look, I second that wish. A simpler way to achieve dotted lines is welcome.
    
    Could you please write a proposition spec describing the full syntax and semantics of such new option?

    Could start by looking at `line-pattern` from Rebol.
