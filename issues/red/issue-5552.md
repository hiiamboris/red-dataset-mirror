**Describe the bug**

Here's two nearly identical function definitions which seem valid to my eye:
```
>> fun: function [/ref x /local y return: [block!]                             ] [a: 1 print "OK"]
*** Script Error: invalid function definition: [/ref x /local y return: [block!] a]
*** Where: native-function
*** Near : native-function spec body
*** Stack: probe function 

>> fun: function [/ref x /local y return: [block!] "locals follow docstring ->"] [a: 1 print "OK"]
== func [/ref x /local y return: [block!] "locals follow docstring ->" a][a: 1 print "OK"]

>> fun/ref 1
*** Script Error: fun is missing its local argument        ;) ???
*** Where: fun
*** Near : fun/ref 1
*** Stack: fun  
```

**To reproduce**
```
fun: function [/ref x /local y return: [block!]                             ] [a: 1 print "OK"]
fun: function [/ref x /local y return: [block!] "locals follow docstring ->"] [a: 1 print "OK"]
fun/ref 1
```

**Expected behavior**

- Personally I don't think that `return:` should be forced in between two refinements `/ref` and `/local`, though that's the only way it works currently. I would prefer to list in the spec ins first (arguments, refinements), outs second (return:)
- `function` should not produce invalid `func` specs
- Invalid `func` specs should not be accepted to create invalid functions that can't be called

    == func [a [block!] return: [block!] /ref /local x][]
    
    >> f/ref []
    *** Script Error: f has no refinement called ref                   ;) ??

    Usage of  `/local` as a marker for local words is problematic since Rebol2 days, it's meant to be replaced by something else, though we haven't decided yet what (`local:` was the candidate, maybe they are better options). Anyway `/local` is not part of the external interface, so that sticking `return:` after the input arguments is correct design, leaving internal words to be specified after that.
