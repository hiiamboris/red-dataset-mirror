This code:
```Red
probe while [true][break/return 42]
i: 1 probe while [i < 5][i: i + 1]
```
Results in:
```Red
unset
unset
```

IMO this is inconsistent with other iterators behavior - they always return result of last evaluated expression. Hence I expect result to be:
```Red
42
5
```

    The first result should indeed be 42, so that is a bug. For the second result: not only `while`, but also `loop`  and `remove-each` currently yield the `unset!` value. So it is not a question of inconsistency, but your expected behaviour would be a wish.

    @9214 There's a least one ticket already about the return value of iterator functions.

    @meijeru yes for `remove-each`, not sure about `loop`:
    ```Red
    i: 1 loop 5 [i: i + 1]
    ```
    Results in `6`.
    
    @dockimbel right, I should accustom myself to double-check open issues. ðŸ˜ž
    Anyway `break/return` example indeed looks like a bug. Same with `remove-each`:
    ```Red
    probe remove-each i [1 2 3] [break/return 42]
    ```
    Returns `unset`.

    @dockimbel, did you mean https://github.com/red/red/issues/1706#issuecomment-229312382 ?
    > We need to decide on the return value for all iterators and then implement it for both compiler and interpreter.
