Parse string! wrong-rule works fine.

```
parse {} [return]
parse {} [parse]
```

And with block! as the input Red crashes:

```
parse [] [return]
parse [] [parse]
parse [] ["why"]
parse [] [red]
parse [] [append]
parse [] [help]
*** Runtime Error 1: access violation
*** at: 000218E5h
```

    When compiled, last example (`parse [] [help]`) throws an error. Just the last one, others are ok:
    
    Source:
    
    ```
    Red []
    
    parse [] [return]
    parse [] [parse]
    parse [] ["why"]
    parse [] [red]
    parse [] [append]
    parse [] [help]
    ```
    
    Output:
    
    ```
    E:\Code\red (master)
    Î» test
    *** Script Error: PARSE - invalid rule or usage of rule: help
    *** Where: parse
    *** Stack: parse
    ```
