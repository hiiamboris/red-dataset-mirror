**Describe the bug**

Side by side output from `on-key-down` and `on-key` (tested on W10 & GTK): 
```
num-lock num-lock    ;) Windows-only; GTK doesn't see the key at all
#"+" #"k"
#"-" #"m"
#"7" #"g"
#"8" #"h"
#"9" #"i"
#"4" #"d"
#"5" #"e"
#"6" #"f"
#"1" #"a"
#"2" #"b"
#"3" #"c"
#"0" #"`"
#"." #"n"
#"^M" #"^M"
none #"^S"
#"*" #"j"
#"/" #"o"
```


**To reproduce**

Run the following script:
```
view [
	box focus "press numpad keys"
	on-key [print [mold event/key mold key]]
	on-key-down [key: event/key]
]
```
Initial NumLock state: off (turned on then by first press)
Press keys: `NumLock + - 7 8 9 4 5 6 1 2 3 0 Del Enter Pause * /`


**Expected behavior**

1. Number keys instead of letters (period for del)
2. Pause key as `'pause` in both events, not as ctrl-s or none
3. NumLock (if possible) detected on GTK. 
4. CapsLock on GTK yields `none #"^T"` instead of `caps-lock caps-lock` right now. Should work as on Windows. Didn't test ScrollLock, might be messed up too.

    As always, thanks for the detailed report and tooling to help test.

    @qtxie I've taken care of the Windows part, I let you process the GTK part.

    1. `event/key` is wrong in `on-key-down`, but it's correct in `on-key`, right? The title of the issue is not accurate.
    
    2. For `on-key-down` and `on-key-up`, the value of `event/key` should be the same no matter `Num Lock` is on or off. I suggest that we always return number keys. That is, value of keys when `Num Lock` is on. So `5` has a value rather than `none` when `Num Lock` is off.

    Currently, it's not the same. Why should it be? I think only `event/picked` (scancode) has to be the same. 
    Although it's possible that laptop keyboard driver works differently than desktop, but with numlock off I get:
    ```
    #"+" #"k"
    #"-" #"m"
    home home
    up up
    end end
    left left
    none #"^L"
    right right
    page-up page-up
    down down
    page-down page-down
    insert insert
    delete delete
    #"^M" #"^M"
    none #"^S"
    #"*" #"j"
    #"/" #"o"
    ```

    To make it easier to know which key is pressed when you don't care much about the value of the key. No matter you pressed `Shift` or `Caps On`, the value is the same. Do we use `event/picked` for scancode?

    Sorry I have misled you. I have no idea what `event/picked` is. Seems to return `to integer! event/key` for `char!` keys, but also some number for `word!` keys, but doesn't look like scan code. I think using it for scan code would be a better idea.

    That's right.

    Only if it can be a cross-platform value.

    Scancodes are cross-platform by definition, however device-dependent :p

    I also expect there can be a problem with emulated keys (e.g. via `keybd_event`), as one does not usually provide a scan code for an emulated key. I sure didn't. I don't think we can provide cross-platform way of knowing the key regardless of locks state, so maybe to hell with it?

    "cross-platform" includes both operating system and hardware.
