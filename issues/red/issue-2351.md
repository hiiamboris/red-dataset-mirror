    Shift, Ctrl and Alt give no event at all. Perhaps CapsLock should do the same?

    I'm not sure if it's on purpose or a bug. Looks like in `on-key` event, we only get the `transalated key`.
    
    for example, if we type `ALT + 248` (pressing ALT, type 248, then release ALT), we get a `Ã¸` character in the area and we get an `on-key` event with this character.
    
    To get the raw key code, we can use `on-key-down` event.

    If I do that, I get `#"^T"` for my CapsLock which is `U+0014` or `DC4 (DEVICE CONTROL FOUR)`. It would be interesting to try all "special" keys this way. The results may not even be the same for all keyboard/OS combinations.
