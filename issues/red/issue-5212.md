**Describe the bug**
`find/same` on block arguments never finds the 2nd argument block in the 1st one.

**To reproduce**
```
blk: [1]
append/only list: make block! 1 blk
find/same list blk
```
results in:
```
none
```

**Expected behavior**
Should return `[[1]]`.

**Platform version**
All.

    `find/same/only`

    `/same` could imply `/only`. We have a few other cases where one refinement implies another. By definition `/same | same?` means "single value", right?

    no more special cases please, we already have enough :)

    So the current behavior means that the values in the `value` are all the same as in the `series`? e.g.
    ```
    a-0: ["A" @aa]
    a-1: copy a-0
    a-2: copy/deep a-0
    
    blk: compose [(a-2) (a-1) (a-0)]
    
    find blk a-0
    find blk a-1
    find blk a-2
    
    find/same blk a-0
    find/same blk a-1
    find/same blk a-2
    ```
    Which gives us both options, at the cost of tripping over it once in a while.
