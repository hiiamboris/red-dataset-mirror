    This still seems buggy to me:
    
    ## Rebol2
    
    ```
    >> b: [1]
    == [1]
    >> p: 'b/1
    == b/1
    >> do p
    == 1
    ```
    
    ## Red 0.6.1 compiler
    
    Source:
    
    ```
    Red []
    
    b: [1]
    p: 'b/1
    probe do p
    ```
    
    Output:
    
    ```
    E:\Code\red (master)
    Î» test
    b/1
    ```
    
    ## Red 0.6.1 interpreter
    
    ```
    red>> b: [1]
    == [1]
    red>> p: 'b/1
    == b/1
    red>> do p
    == false
    ```
