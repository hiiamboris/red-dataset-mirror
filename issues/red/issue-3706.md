    Did you try with libcurl4?
    
    `sudo apt-get install libcurl4`

    As stated on [download page](https://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html), `libcurl` and other supporting libraries are _temporal_ dependencies. With that in mind, I don't see a need to create `.deb` package for what is planned to be a single executable.
    
    OP's specific problem can be resolved by following instuctions on the said page and installing 4th version of `libcurl` instead of 3rd.
    
    @x8x ðŸ‘† have you got a chance to dig into this issue for Debian-based distros?

    @9214 The download page is updated, thought, have to ~verify the exact version where the change occurred and~ add Alpine Linux instructions.

    now after 2nd thought i came to a conclusion that .deb is a rubbish and bloat for rebol/red. trashcan

    ?
    Oh well, `apt install rebol red` would be just so convenient for a daily use of these marvellous languages, that are just so useful and magical for daily GNU/Linux administration tasks, both on servers or on clients.
    
    Note that I'm not referring to `dpkg -i`, but to `apt` or similar (yum, etc.).
    
    The gain of popularity from the availability of such a package would be great, by spreading the word among the world of GNU/Linux sysops.
    
    At the moment, when you mention "Rebol" or "Red" to them (us), and they have to get an executable which ... sometimes doesn't run, it is most often a no-go.  Too bad.
