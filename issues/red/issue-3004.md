I wish `reverse` could treat series as a bunch of fixed-size records:
```Red
>> reverse/skip [a 1 b 2] 2
== [b 2 a 1]
```
perhaps `/by` is a better name?

    `/skip`  is appropriate: it tells what it does, in the same way as `sort` and all the others that have such a refinement

    @toomasv posted a mezz version in gitter chat I think. Though having it as standard would be better. I don't have one in my old toolbox, but think I needed this a couple times through the years.

    Agreed. We should also add the missing `/part` option, which is present in Rebol.

    Here is my version:
    ```
    reverse: func [
        series /skip size /part length /local i tuple
    ][
    	switch type?/word series [
    		pair! [return to-pair reduce [series/2 series/1]]
    		tuple! [tuple: clear [] repeat i length? series [append tuple pick series i] series: copy tuple tuple: yes]
    	]
        size: any [size 1]
        either 0 = ((length? series) % size) [
            length: any [length length? series]
            i: 1
            loop (length / size - 1) [
                i: i + size
                series: at head series i
                insert head series take/part series size
            ] 
            series: head series
        ][cause-error 'user 'message ["Wrong length of series or skip!"]]
    	either tuple [to-tuple series][series]
    ]
    ```

    I took the role of self-serving wish fairy and granted myself what I asked for 3 years ago üßö‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hope that's OK.
