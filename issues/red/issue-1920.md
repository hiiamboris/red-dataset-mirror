Itâ€™s possible to draw outside of window (at least with `image` widget). This code:

```
view [
    size 200x50 
    text "Image outside of window:" 
    at 210x0 
    image %icons/10.Folder.png
]
```

produces this result:

    This is a feature I use for creating a nice flash screen for my applications! Please do not fix this.

    This is a bug we need to fix. Proper support for transparent windows will come in the future.

    Here is another example of image not clipped by the window:
    
    ```
    view [
        size 300x500
        image 300x500 draw [line 0x0 300x500 line 0x500 300x0]
    ]
    ```
