I am not sure whether p is a reserved word in the Red 6.0 console.
When I start the console and type p I get "red>> " as the value of p.
Typing 'what' doesn't show p as defined, but type? gives string.

    I was using 0.6.0 from April 5.
    I can confirm the problem is fixed in 0.6.0 from April 19.
