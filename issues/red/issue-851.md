A new keyword AFTER should be added to PARSE. The AFTER should behave like the INTO keyword did before issue #791 was fixed.
Adding the keyword would enable already existing Red functionality to be used without adding and maintaining complex workarounds.
(Specifically the tryrebol site could be updated to the current Red version and updates for following Red releases will be possible too).
