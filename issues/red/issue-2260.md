I have [this file](http://www.qyz.cz/red/messages.red) that is full of messages from Gitterâ€™s Red/Red channel. I am able to load it under W7, but under OSX, I got `*** Runtime Error 1: access violation`.

    It works fine on my Mac OSX 10.9 VM.
    
    But it consumes a bit more than 500MB memory on both platforms. :astonished:

    I can confirm that itâ€™s possible to load the file now. Must have been fixed with some commit in the last month. Yes, it takes lot of memory, itâ€™s a LOT of `map!`s ðŸ˜ˆ
