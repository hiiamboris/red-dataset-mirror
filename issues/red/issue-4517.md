**Describe the bug**

Very dangerous stuff! â˜»

**To reproduce**
```
Red []

print-it: function [b] [
	?? b
	b: reduce b
	?? b
	f: :b/1
	print [:f]
	print [:b/1]
]

print-it [does [print "CALLED"]]
```
Interpreted:
```
b: [does [print "CALLED"]]  
b: [func [][print "CALLED"]]
?function?                  
?function?                  
```
Compiled:
```
b: [does [print "CALLED"]]  
b: [func [][print "CALLED"]]
?function?                  
CALLED                      
```

**Expected behavior**

Should respect get-paths and not call them.

**Platform version (please complete the following information)**
```

    Looks related to https://github.com/red/red/issues/4451. `:b/1` is stored in Redbin, but either encoder (likely) or decoder messes up and it ends up being a `path!`, not a `get-path!`. When `print` calls `reduce` internally and traverses thru values in a block, there's already `path!` in it.
