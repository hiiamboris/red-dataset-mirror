    view [
        fld1: field 200 "You want more?" on-enter [probe fld1]
        return
        button "probe" [probe fld1 ]
        button "stop" [unview]
    ]
Where can I find the cursor location for the cursor in this field fld1?
This is the code generated by probe fld1

```

This is helpful when content is automatically changed to assist user input and resetting the cursor to the expected position instead of the beginning of the input.

    The issue tracker is _not_ a place where you ask programming question, it is for reporting crashes and bugs. As a long time user of both Red and this tracker, you should know that by now...
