```
red>> #"^(f)"
== "(f)"
red>> type? "a"
== string!
red>> type? #"^(f)"
== "(f)"
red>> type? #"^(0f)"
== char!
```

in REBOL2:

```
>> #"^(f)"
== #"^O"
>> #"^(0f)"
== #"^O"
```

    @Oldes This is caused by the Red runtime lexer doesn't accept this form of `escape char`. In current implement, must have 2 - 6 hex numbers when use escape form.

    @qtxie We could relax that restriction for escaped values, as they have special delimiters around them. The 2-6 limit was just added to reduce the risk of collision between integer hex notation and words. What do you think?

    @dockimbel Yes, I agree with you. I'll change the rule to accept it.

    Also it would be good to throw an error on invalid value. Now the # char seems to be skipped and rest is treated as a valid string!, which is not good behavior.
    EDIT: above is not true:) it does not return any type, so it's even more invalid.

    @qtxie You wrote that youâ€™ll relax the rules, but current behaviour is:
    
    ```
    red>> #"^(f)"
    *** Syntax Error: invalid char! at {#"^^(f)"}
    *** Where: do
    ```
    
    Is it expected, or should it work as Rebol?
