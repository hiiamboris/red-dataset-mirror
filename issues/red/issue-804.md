I downloaded the mac version from  http://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html
I've tried to open it every way I can think of. I get "file doesn't exist" messages. When I double click it opens and immediately exits with "permission denied". I've tried "open" and other commands from terminal. When I run "file" on it mac says "red-42 doesn't exist" 

Thanks

    These steps should work:
    1. Download the red binary and store it in a suitable folder. Let's say you saved it in /Users/Wiiliam/Red
    2. Open terminal and enter the following commands.
    3. Change to the directory containing the Red binary using
       
       cd /Users/William/Red
    4. Make the Red binary executable using
       
       chmod +x red-042 
    5. Run the Red binary using
       
       ./red-042
    
    You should see something similar to this:
    
    ```
    Schulz:Red peter$ chmod +x red-042-darwin
    Schulz:Red peter$ ./red-042-darwin
    Pre-compiling Red console...
    
    -=== Red Console alpha version ===-
    Type HELP for starting information.
    
    red>> 
    ```
    
    if you then enter system/version, you should see this:
    
    == "0.4.2, 2-May-2014/17:43:09+8:00"
    
    Enter quit to finish the Red session.  
    
    If you have any questions of a similar nature, please raise them in a different forum such as the Red Google Group or on StackOverflow and not by raising a bug ticket.
