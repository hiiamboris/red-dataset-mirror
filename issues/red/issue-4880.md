**Describe the bug**

Given a magickal incantation of this form (it took hours to distill it from the codebase):
```
do [do [do [try/all [1]]]]       ;) depth on which try is invoked is important here
loop 1 [loop 1 [continue]]
print "OK"
```
the interpreter can be forced into repentance:
```
*** Throw Error: no loop to continue
*** Where: continue
*** Stack:
```

**To reproduce**

Stack depth is the key to the above code. Add any (equal) depth to `do ..` and `loop 1 ..` lines and the spell will still work. Add set-words before them (also in the equal amount) and it will work. So I am as usual inclined to blame some dark stack trickery where some code parts rely on other distant code parts doing something specific with the stack, but that assumption never holds true long enough during refactoring.

**Expected behavior**

Should print "OK".

**Platform version**

`console-2016-6-30-23134.exe` prints "OK".
`console-2017-4-12-1647.exe` and all versions up to `Red 0.6.4 for Windows built 18-Mar-2021/22:28:01+03:00  commit #73d9bd2` do suffer from the spell's harmful effect.

    I'm glad the master of the dark arts is on our side.

    It will be interesting to see how these findings affect the re-design of Red's internals.

    That error seems to be gone in current version:
    ```
    >> do [do [do [try/all [1]]]]       ;) depth on which try is invoked is important here
    == 1
    >> loop 1 [loop 1 [continue]]
    >> print "OK"
    OK
    ```
    
    I will add a regression test anyway.

    @dockimbel the spell doesn't work from console, as console wraps calls in a series of try & catch scopes. It has to be a separate script.
    
    Or copy it and `do read-clipboard`.

    Issue still happens in the `run-all-interp` combined tests, while it runs fine from `try-tests` group.

    Separate script fed to console exe:
    ```
    Red []
    
    catch [loop 1 [loop 1 [throw 1]]]
    x: x: loop 1 [
    	do [
    		foreach x [1 2 3] [
    			1 - 2 * 3
    			continue
    		]
    	]
    	1
    ] 
    
    print "OK"
    ```
    Result:

    Similarly, need preparation (here, `catch` + `throw`) and trigger (`continue` from `foreach`). Also similarly, a matching number of `do [` levels can be added to both preparation and trigger and crash will reappear, e.g. (3 levels added):
    ```
    Red []
    
    do [do [do [catch [loop 1 [loop 1 [throw 1]]]]]]
    do [do [do [x: x: loop 1 [
    	do [
    		foreach x [1 2 3] [
    			1 - 2 * 3
    			continue
    		]
    	]
    	1
    ]]]]
    
    print "OK"
    ```

    With one less loop:
    ```
    Red []
    
    catch [loop 1 [throw 1]]
    x: x: do [
    	foreach x [1 2 3] [
    		1 - 2 * 3
    		continue
    	]
    	1
    ]
    
    print "OK"
    ```
    It tells me:
    ```
    *** Throw Error: no loop to continue
    *** Where: *
    *** Near : continue
    *** Stack:
    ```

    The infix chaining is corrupting the call stack. Replacing `1 - 2 * 3` by  `1 - 2` makes it work fine.
