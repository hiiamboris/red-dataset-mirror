#3198: Unable to RED in Windows 7: Access Error
================================================================================

Red version 0.63 refuses to do anything with Windows 7 due to:

Driver Internal Error: Access Error: Cannot open /C/ProgramData/Red/red-console.red

Is there an easy and cheap fix for this?

    It's not a common issue, but one we need to get in a wiki, if not already there.
