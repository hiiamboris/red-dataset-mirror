It would be nice if in the Red console, as in the Rebol console, you could have tab completion on filenames, so after the % (and the first character), if you hit tab, it will bring up possible completions.

(Unlike the Rebol console, it would be nice if you didn't have to type a character after the % though).

    Thanks! It is working well. Do you think there is any chance of making the autocomplete work with just having typed `cd` ('cd' + space)?
