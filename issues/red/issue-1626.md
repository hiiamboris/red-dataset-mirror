Not sure if this is a feature :-) A single empty command line (`red>><ENTER>`) is sufficient to make the up and down arrows show nothing anymore. However, the history is not gone away, and it reappears when a non empty input line is supplied!

    @meijeru Which version are you on? Works fine for me on latest master binaries...
    This was supposedly fixed earlier https://github.com/red/red/issues/1562

    I still use the 31-Jan version. Did not check far enough back to see if this was a solved issue. Sorry!

    Confirming that it works fine with current version.
