#1782: Put parsing rules from transcode into a separate context, to make them accessible.

 **Transcode** function in red/environment/lexer.red defines all its parsing rules in local.
Instead, they could have their own context in **system/lexer** so that we can reuse them in our own code.

    @dockimbel is this still relevant?
    
    ```red
    >> parse to binary! "1 word [:block]" [integer! word! space #"[" get-word! #"]"]
    == true
    ```

    As the lexer has been redesigned and reimplemented totally, this ticket does not apply anymore.
