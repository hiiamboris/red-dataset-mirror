Inserting to hash!â€™s tail crashes after seven elements. Appending works fine though.

```
red>> h: make hash! []
== make hash! []
red>> insert tail h 1
== make hash! []
red>> insert tail h 1
== make hash! []
red>> insert tail h 1
== make hash! []
red>> insert tail h 1
== make hash! []
red>> insert tail h 1
== make hash! []
red>> insert tail h 1
== make hash! []
red>> insert tail h 1
