Consider this code:

```
o: object [f: func [v] [v + 1]]
f: :o/f
print f 1
```

When run from interpreter, it prints `2` as expected. However, when you try to compile it, you get `*** Red Compiler Internal Error: Script Error : copy expected value argument of type: series port bitset`.

    It compiles OK here with Red version of 31-Jan-2016 under W10. So maybe a regression?
