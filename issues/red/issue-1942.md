#1942: Fix for #1920 breaks Red
================================================================================
Issue is closed, was reported by Zamlox and has 24 comment(s).

<https://github.com/red/red/issues/1942>

Following code will crash Red:

```
w: layout/only [base 100x100 blue]
main: layout [base 200x200 30.40.50.255]
main/pane/1/pane: w
view main
```

Because 'main' has alpha? set, `Os-make-view` will call `process-layered-region` which calls `get-face-handle`. Last function called will check for `state` and it will crash.

    @qtxie @nc-x So is #1942 fixed? I can't reproduce the crash anymore.

    @dockimbel I never got any crashes. 
    I just redownloaded the source after the commit which fixed #1920 and caused this issue but got no crashes. :smile: 
    And I am not getting any crashes after the fix for this as well. :smile:
    So most probably fixed.

    Shoudn't we see a blue face inside the window? It doesn't seem to work, so maybe we should close this ticket and open a new one for that other issue? @qtxie What do you think?

    Nope. It's correct. We can not see anything because the `main` face is totally transparent.

    But the `main` face has a child face which is blue (not transparent), we should see it?

    Yes, you're right. It's a bug.

    But if we set the `visible?` of the parent to `false`, all child windows become invisible too.

    We can see the blue face now in the last version.
