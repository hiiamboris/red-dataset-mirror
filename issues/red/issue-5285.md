Likely after https://github.com/red/red/commit/1ea076c4177b31897663433490c45049f1e93045

**Describe the bug**

There's some weird character reordering going on when `collect into` is used:
```
[collect into out rule] "p-------dgg bt bst n mrs"
[collect into out rule] "p-rs------dgg bt bst n m"
[collect after out rule] "p-rs- m-st n-t b- b-gg-d"
```

I also notice orders of magnitude slowdowns on big buffer, likely due to insert being used instead of append.

**To reproduce**

```
Red [] 

vowel: charset "aeiou"
str: {parse must not be bugged}

out: {}
rule: [
	(clear out)
	any [keep to vowel skip keep (#"-")]
	keep to end
]
parse str b: [collect into  out rule] print [mold b mold out]
take/last append str "Â¿"			;) alters the output!
parse str b: [collect into  out rule] print [mold b mold out]
parse str b: [collect after out rule] print [mold b mold out]
```

**Expected behavior**

`collect after` result is the correct one

**Platform version**
