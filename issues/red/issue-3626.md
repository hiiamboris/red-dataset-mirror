#3626: [DOC] Update View/VID documentation with regard to units used

**Describe the bug**

[Since some time](https://github.com/red/red/commit/b3da143e621e8b254c8e9e8a7a9b4652dfc30d04) the View engine became DPI-aware. Every pair! is expressed in some logical screen units, not pixels. Documentation should clearly state that in a separate paragraph and use word "screen unit" instead of "pixel" everywhere.
