    @bitbegin I think @9214 means executing the file above not the `image.red`
    
    @9214 It worked for me on W10 x64: `Red 0.6.4 for Windows built 5-Dec-2018/12:31:35+03:00 commit #90c8e83`

    It's strange that others can't reproduce it. Still the case for me with the latest build.

    you can put call-stack here, using `-r -d` argument

    Interesting, I just tried to reproduce it with my own Github profile pic taken from this chat, no crash.

    @9214 Can you share the image file you try?

    seams GC bug:
    
    ```
    >> recycle/off
    >> to binary! trim mold/only reduce [load %3.jpg]
    ```

    > The only known leak is the bitmaps object allocated from the OS by `image!` values.

    @9214 Crashes pictures in buggy.zip. Works if `recycle/off`.

    @9214 @endo64 can you check if https://github.com/red/red/pull/3644 work for you? it works for me both:
    `save %image.red reduce [load %1.png]` and `to binary! append/dup a: "" "a" 1100000` are all run ok

    If turn off the GC can make it work, then there is a bug in the GC. Maybe the GC corrupt the memory used by the C's allocator. As a consequence `copy-memory` crashes.

    @bitbegin still the same: both my snippet and your one-liner result in a crash (that is, with GC turned on).

    @9214 Thanks. I need to add some tests before closing it.

    @9214 Yes. I should have added it before. Now I don't even know how does the commit fix the issue. ðŸ˜“ I'll try to figure it out today and write the test. Otherwise I'll just add the code in the issue into the test suite.
