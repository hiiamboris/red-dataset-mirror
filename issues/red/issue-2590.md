Here is a wired encoding behaviour:
```
   a: {Ingeﾌ］ierie}
;   "Ingeﾌ］ierie"
  write to-file a ""
  b: read %.
;   [%Ingeﾌ］ierie]
  read b/1
;   ""
  a: {620 Ingeﾌ］ierie}
;   "620 Ingeﾌ］ierie"
  write to-file a ""
  b: read %.
;   [%620%20Inge%00nierie %Ingeﾌ］ierie]
  read b/1
*** Access Error: cannot open: %620%20Inge%00nierie
*** Where: read
```
Also, it would be nicer to have:
`%"file name with space"`
instead of url-escaped:
`%file%20name%20with%20space`
in the result.

    The URL-escaped version is the proper file format, the `%"..."` form is accepted by the lexer and converted to the canonical form. What is missing is proper encoding of the file name when written back in the filesystem.
