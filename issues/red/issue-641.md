The link on the main webpage pointing to instructions to use the Java bridge is broken it brings up a 404 page.

"Instructions for using this bridge and compiling the hello example
https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/tree/master/red/bridges/java
"

I can imagine the information is out of date but then the link should point to a page telling you this or still the outdated info, not a 404 page.

    The link(s) should point to the new page:
    https://github.com/red/red/tree/master/bridges/java
    
    (The information itself could be updated to the new encapped situation.)

    The repo layout change broke most of the old deep links to the code in all the previous blog articles. I won't have time to fix them all before I come back from my trip. Maybe @PeterWAWood could if he has the spare time, else I'll do it once back.
