Hi. I changed lines 8 and 9 in `call.r` to the following then _kernel32.dll_ could be found. This is about Windows 7 64 bit and running red from the rebol/view console.

8:  `path: to-rebol-file get-env "SystemRoot"`
9:  `kernel32: load/library path/System32/kernel32.dll`

This did not seem worth a pull request. (Kindly) correct me if I am wrong.

Regards,

    The command executed from the rebol/view console: `>> do %run-all.r"`

    Hi Sylvain
    
    call.r is a library program taken from the Cheyenne Server project ( http://cheyenne-server.org ). It is only used to by quick-test.r to compile and run the tests (or just run the tests).
    
    I regularly run the Red tests from the Rebol/View console  under Windows 7 64 bit and experience no problems.
    
    What was the problem that you encountered?
    
    Regards
    
    Peter

    This is a sample of the output from running the Red tests from the Rebol/View console under Windows 7/64:

    Hello Peter. This is what I get here.
    
    Without modifying call.r:
    
    ```

    >>
    ```
    
    Then after changing lines 8 ad 9 as per first comment I got the following quick-test log:
    
    ```

    ```
    
    I killed  the process before it finished, the rebol console window was marked as "Not responding" and looking at the process from Task Manager I saw no activity for a few minutes. I am still looking into the reasons why some "Red print" cases they fail.
    
    Tweaking the call.r I needed to do, otherwise the tests would not start at all. But I see you succeed in running them all, should I wait longer then?

    I am running it from Windows 7 64-bit also and have no issues with loading kernel32.dll. @srpelissier Does your Windows system setup have anything non-standard?

    Maybe something is special. I'll give a try with another machine.

    With a 32-bit virtual box, locating kernel32 is not a problem.
    Executing the tests though stops working during regression-tests.r:
    - REBOL/View window marked as (Not Responding)
    - rebol-view-278-3-1.exe process shown as using no CPU and 18272 K of memory but no activity.
    
    Last lines from quick-test\quick-test.log:
    
    ```

    ```
    
    I plan to try another 64-bit machine soon, maybe this weekend.

    @srpelissier 
    1. REBOL/View is often no responding on my Windows 7 when running `run-all.r`. :(  I need to try many times to get all tests completed. I think it Rebol's problem. Btw, it works fine on Linux.
    2. Two tests failed. It is the first two cases in `print-test.r`. This is caused by a new fix for `print`. 
    
    ```
    >> print ["*test1* " 1]
    "*test1*  1"                    ;-- two spaces between *test1* and 1
    ```

    This is from a Windows 64 machine where I have full control, and there is nothing very special about it. I just installed rebol/view and rebased the files from github.
    
    ```

    The REBOL `load/library` [function](http://www.rebol.com/docs/library.html#loading) is automatically searching for the target library in all system paths. From the linked documentation:
    
    _If you only specify the file name in load/library (instead of the absolute file path), the operating system searches for the library in the current directory, then in the system library directories._
    
    So it seems that for some reason, the search stops at the current folder in your case.
    
    I do not remember experiencing such issues on my Windows 7 64bit boxes...

    "1. REBOL/View is often no responding on my Windows 7 when running run-all.r. :( I need to try many times to get all tests completed. I think it Rebol's problem. "
    'Glad' that I am not the only one experiencing this. Especially if not all memory is dedicated to Rebol/View or focus is not constantly on the compile console the test tends to hang up
    If this problem continues it can become a serious danger to the project.

    @iArnold So now for quick test,  I use `run-all-comp.red` and `run-all-interp.red`. : )

    @qtxie and what script do you use to generate the `auto-tests`?

    @PeterWAWood I know,,I just want to make sure if @qtxie know, that above mentioned red scripts does not update the `auto-tests`. At least not now.

    @srpelissier Could you please give it a new try using Rebol/View 2.7.6 from [here](http://www.rebol.com/downloads/rebview276.exe), the newer versions are quite buggy. I just want to check if that is the cause of your issue.

    Hi Peter.
    Yes. In REBOL/View 2.76, the tests now run until the end. Two of them fail (function).
    (red has been updated from git)
    - in REBOL/View 2.7.8.3.1, the tests hang while "running regression-tests.r" (fifth group)
    - in REBOL/View 2.7.6.3.1, all tests pass except for:
    
    ```
    ~~~started test~~~ function
    ===group=== Scope of Varibles
    --test-- scope1 issue #825 FAILED**************
    --test-- scope2 issue #825 FAILED**************

    HI Sylvain
    
    Thanks for running the tests under Rebol/View 2.7.6. (By the way, it was Nenad who sent you the request   . If anybody can fix the problem, he can.). 
    
    I added the two failing tests today and need to check the tests are correct before anything else is done.

    Actually it is still almost impossible to run `run-all.r` script on Windows, which would not stop responding. At least in regular Windows (not in VM). Just tested it now without success on Win10 with `REBOL/View 2.7.8.3.1 1-Jan-2011`. I guess we cannot do much with it as it will be Rebol's issue. Maybe port the test scripts to Red asap.

    I don't trust 2.7.7 and 2.7.8 on Windows, I always use 2.7.6 and have no issue running the tests. @PeterWAWood will be working on porting the testing framework to Red as soon as we integrate CALL properly into the Red runtime library.

    @dockimbel I don't have 2.7.6 anymore... do you know a link where it's available?
