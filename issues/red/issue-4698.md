**Describe the bug**

I have $DISPLAY var set to an IP address of the VM host and trying to produce an exe that doesn't require a running GUI environment (XServer is down on the host):
1. Script: `1.red`: `Red [] print "hello"`
2. Compile it: `red -c -t Linux-Old 1.red`
3. Run it: `./1` -- it just **hangs** (it will not hang if XServer is running on the host!)

Whereas `red -r -t Linux-Old 1.red` produces a working exe.

Notes:
1. Alternative compilation way (assuming Linux): `red -c --config "[sub-system: 'console]" 1.red` doesn't help the matter.
2. GTK-enabled compilation works just the same: `red -c -t Linux 1.red` will produce an exe that hangs, `red -r -t Linux 1.red` will produce an exe that works regardless of the XServer state.
3. If I `unset DISPLAY`, then `./1` compiled in devmode tells me this and terminates (does not hang):
```
Unable to init server: Could not connect: Connection refused
(1:1145): Gtk-WARNING **: 20:13:05.183: cannot open display:
```

**Expected behavior**

1. Should print `hello` in both `-r` and `-c` compilation modes.
2. An error instead of hanging when it can't init the GUI.

**Platform version**
```
Red 0.6.4 for Linux built 16-Oct-2020/21:35:47+03:00 commit #df54dcd
```
W10 host running WSL2 VM with Ubuntu OS.

    GTK dependency without `Needs: View` header? That's an implementation issue.

    What about `--no-view`?

    @hiiamboris I don't think we have `Linux-Old` target. Try `Linux` just in case.

    `-t Linux` works the same, just tried.
