    Strangely, the same code is OK on W7 0.6.4 30-Jan-2019.

    I can't reproduce on Win10. This seems like it shouldn't be platform specific.

    `dehex` isn't platform-specific.

    Could be something to do with endianness? @rebred is your Mac OS on big-endian CPU?

    Unless I'm missing something, `9C` is a continuation byte (starts with `10`) and cannot be the first byte of a code unit. Makes me think that this string doesn't use UTF-8 encoding table at all.
    ```red
    >> enbase/base #{9C} 2
    == "10011100"
    ```

    Cf. [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986), a valid set of percent-encoded characters is:
    
    
    ! | # | $ | % | & | ' | ( | ) | * | + | , | / | : | ; | = | ? | @ | [ | ]
    -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
    %21 | %23 | %24 | %25 | %26 | %27 | %28 | %29 | %2A | %2B | %2C | %2F | %3A | %3B | %3D | %3F | %40 | %5B | %5D
    
    Thus:
    
    In the [original](https://github.com/red/red/issues/3780#issue-410013226) report (which no one ever been able to reproduce):
    
    | Part | Decoding |
    |:-|:-|
    | `%23 8710` | `#8710` |
    
    Note the reported error message:
    
    ```red
    *** Access Error: invalid UTF-8 encoding: #{E7262300}
    *** Where: dehex
    *** Stack:  
    ```
    `E726` are trash bytes that precede `23` (`#` character), which is then followed by a null byte. That doesn't match the provided input. And if it does then the input is malformed and cannot be properly decoded.
    
    In [subsequent](https://github.com/red/red/issues/3780#issuecomment-463782097) report:
    
    | Part | Decoding |
    |:-|:-|
    | `%9C` | Trash byte |
    | `%26%23 8721 %3B` | `&#8721;` |
    | `%AE%B4%86%A9%F8%83` | Trash bytes |
    | `%26%23 8706 %3B` | `&#8706;` |
    | `%26%23 729 %3B` | `&#729;` |
    | `pdsjbkz` | `pdsjbkz` |
    
    
    Unless someone provides a reproducible example, I propose we close this.

    Closing as it can't be reproduced.
