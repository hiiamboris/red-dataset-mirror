**Describe the bug**

What do the docs say:
![](https://i.gyazo.com/d3884c1a599fe7bec562098c8c3ead3f.png)

So, essentially, `qcurv`, in contrast to other shape curve functions, can only accept one point (1).
Let's try it in 3 different ways...
```
view [
	base 250x250 draw [		; feeding a single point
		scale 10 10 pen linear cyan purple 
		shape [move 5x5 qcurv 20x5 qcurv 20x20 qcurv 5x20 qcurv 5x5 move 5x5]
	] 
	base 250x250 draw [		; feeding pairs of points
		scale 10 10 pen linear cyan purple 
		shape [move 5x5 qcurv 20x5 20x20 qcurv 5x20 5x5 move 5x5]
	] 
	base 250x250 draw [		; feeding a bunch
		scale 10 10 pen linear cyan purple 
		shape [move 5x5 qcurv 20x5 20x20 5x20 5x5 move 5x5]
	] 
]
```

Some nice smoothing (2) â˜»

**Expected behavior**

(1) bug in the docs - should accept multiple points
(2) behavior of R2 is desired - here's the R2 script version and the R2 result:
```
view layout [
	across
	box 250x250 effect [draw [
		scale 10 10 pen red
		shape [move 5x5 qcurv 20x5 qcurv 20x20 qcurv 5x20 qcurv 5x5 move 5x5]
	]]
	box 250x250 effect [draw [
		scale 10 10 pen red
		shape [move 5x5 qcurv 20x5 20x20 qcurv 5x20 5x5 move 5x5]
	]]
	box 250x250 effect [draw [
		scale 10 10 pen red
		shape [move 5x5 qcurv 20x5 20x20 5x20 5x5 move 5x5]
	]]
]
```

    There actually is one scenario where it does work, albeit only once. After `qcurve`.
    ```
    view [
    	base 250x250 draw [
    		scale 10 10 pen linear cyan purple 
    		shape [move 5x5 qcurve 20x5 20x20 qcurv 5x20 qcurv 5x5]
    	] 
    	base 250x250 draw [
    		scale 10 10 pen linear cyan purple 
    		shape [move 5x5 qcurve 20x5 20x20 qcurv 5x20 5x5]
    	] 
    ]
    ```

    While the same code in R2 - `qcurv` can continue the curve indefinitely:
    ```
    view layout [
    	across
    	box 250x250 effect [draw [
    		scale 10 10 pen red
    		shape [move 5x5 qcurve 20x5 20x20 qcurv 5x20 5x5]
    	]]
    	box 250x250 effect [draw [
    		scale 10 10 pen red
    		shape [move 5x5 qcurve 20x5 20x20 qcurv 5x20 qcurv 5x5]
    	]]
    ]
    ```
