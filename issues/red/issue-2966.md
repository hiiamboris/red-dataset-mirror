I new in Red language, and looks amazing, but I can't found how to install Red in Manjaro KDE 64 bits.

I tried with raw binaries but have had no success. 

BTW, Is http://red.github.io a kind of second official page?

    Rather than opening tickets for questions, please visit https://gitter.im/red/red or https://gitter.im/red/red/welcome and ask there. 
    
    Red is 32-bit only at this time. 64-bit will come when self-hosted.
