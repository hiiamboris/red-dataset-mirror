    As a side-note, they are many ways to crash face objects currently, as the backends implement very little type-checking on facets for now. So I would consider such issues as low priority for now, until we get closer to 1.0.

    @dockimbel Should we add a milestone (ex. 0.9.x) to this and these kind of issues to not examine them again. Later we can fine tune the milestones, like we did with 0.6.4 and 0.6.5.

    @endo64 I have at least one 0.9.x milestone planned for searching for all the ways to crash the runtime code and fixing them. I also have one for cleaning up and polishing all the language features, so that we can get a solid 1.0 design-wise too.

    FYI the provided snippet doesn't crash for me on W7. Tried multiple builds down to 0.6.1.

    @hiiamboris that's cool, but you should really click that button.

    I did â˜» Nevermind, I see that the console crashes *after I click it and then close the window*

    It doesn't crash now, yet there's still an issue with this:
    ```
    >> view [button [face/pane: 'boom]]        ;) ....then click the button
    *** Script Error: foreach does not allow word for its series argument
    *** Where: foreach
    *** Stack: view do-events do-actor do-safe show 
    ```
    Should such internal errors pop out?
