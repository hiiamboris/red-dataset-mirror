Hi guys, how's going?

I'm searching for an answer and I really don't know where to search about it, but, is already possible to create an entire application running on Red? If so, there is maturity enough to create a web based app?

Thank you.

    Development is going well and Red will reach the stage where it is possible to build an entire application soon.
