    I haven't pulled your scripts Arie, but is it the same issue as https://github.com/red/red/issues/3156 ?

    Hi Gregg,
    
    maybe it is the same issue. Although it is also possible that it is related
    to a load stmt in the function where it goes awry ...
    
    Best regards,
       Arie

    I can confirm it's the same bug, if you move everything into one file, it's basically same code as #3156.
