    Still it is really a pity this was _not_ included in the released version today. Now this very basic error will be in the release version the entire period and so _every_ newcomer will experience this, there are very few newcomers that will select to download the daily build over the one supported by the big download button.

    We plan to make a new release next week, so that should be fine.
