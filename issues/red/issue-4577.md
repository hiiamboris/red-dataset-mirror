#4577: Remainder silently allows (char % negative int) and (tuple % negative int)
================================================================================
Issue is closed, was reported by hiiamboris and has 10 comment(s).
[status.resolved]

**Describe the bug**

```
>> #"^A" % 10
== #"^A"
>> #"^A" % -10
== #"^A"
```
Latter should be `-#"^A"` which is impossible, so should raise an error.

```
>> 1.2.3.4 % -10
== 1.2.3.4
```
Same here.

**Platform version (please complete the following information)**
```
Red 0.6.4 for Windows built 30-Jun-2020/21:32:08+03:00
```

    This and https://github.com/red/red/issues/4215 actually remind me... @theSherwood since you have expressed an interest in writing tests, would you like to work on `tuple!` datatype test suite?

    Consider:
    ```red
    >> to integer! #"A"
    == 65
    >> 65 % -10
    == 5
    >> #"A" % -10
    == #"^E"
    >> to integer! #"A" % -10
    == 5
    ```
    
    > Same here.
    
    Consider:
    ```red
    >> 7.8.0 % -4
    == 3.0.0
    >> 7x8 % -4
    == 3x0
    ```
    
    AFAIK remainder can be negative only if the dividend is negative. And since neither `char!` nor `tuple!` can be negative, the existing behavior is IMO expected.
