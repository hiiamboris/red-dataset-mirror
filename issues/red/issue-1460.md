These are the only types of faces **unaffected** by their `color`.
- button
- tab-panel
- camera
- progress

`base` is the only type of face **affected** by the opacity of its `color`.

    Some widgets cannot be affected by their `color` facet. We'll document the available facets for each widget.
    Here is the [documents](https://doc.red-lang.org/en/view.html).
