#3774: Unexplained behavior when using "until" loop
================================================================================
Issue is closed, was reported by pimgeek and has 8 comment(s).

**Describe the bug**
 "until" loop shows weird behavior

**To reproduce**
just run the following red script
```red
Red[]

num: 4
until [
  prin "x"
	num: num - 1
	num == 0
]
```

**Expected behavior**
expect until loop to print 4 "x", but the actual result has 8 "x".

**Platform version**

Red 0.6.4 for Windows built 22-Nov-2018/8:40:38+08:00 commit #755eb94

    This has nothing to do with `until` or any other looping construct; most likely the issue is in buffered output of GUI console engine.
    
    @pimgeek can you reproduce this bug with the [latest build](https://static.red-lang.org/dl/auto/win/red-latest.exe)?

    I can reproduce this bug with `gui-console-2019-2-4-67544.exe`, but when I use `console-2019-2-4-67544.exe` or `console-2018-11-22-8164.exe` to execute the same script, the bug cannot be reproduced. ðŸ˜„

    This has been fixed: https://github.com/red/red/issues/3761
    
    Only the GUI console is affected.
