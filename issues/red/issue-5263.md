**Describe the bug**

```
>> copy/part "abcde" 2x4
== "bc"
>> copy/part "abcde" 1x4
== "abc"
>> copy/part "abcde" 0x4
== "abcd"
>> copy/part "abcde" -1x4
== "abcde"
```

**Expected behavior**

I find the range treatment completely unintuitive, since both pair component are indices, it's hard to imagine what is being copied. I would prefer both be offsets rather than indices. 

But anyway, inside the current model it should produce:
```
>> copy/part "abcde" 2x4
== "bc"
>> copy/part "abcde" 1x4
== "abc"
>> copy/part "abcde" 0x4
== "abc"
>> copy/part "abcde" -1x4
== "abc"
```

**Platform version**

    I wonder if there is any use case for this already? I think that it would be more intuitive, if the `y` pair's value was interpreted as a length and so `copy/part str 2x3` would be same like `copy/part at str 2 3`.

    My personal view illustrated on a simple example. Let's say I have a text selected: `_xxxx__` (`x` is selected, `_` not selected).
    
    It can be encoded as `1x5` (start-offset x end-offset), which I find easiest to work with since that maps directly to the picture in my brain. It's easy to reverse, translate, obtain length and skip.
    
    `2x6` is how copy currently sees it, which is problematic to imagine, since there's nothing of length `2` in the image, and nothing of length `6`. I have to subtract 1 in my mind to from both values to map it onto the image. Index trickery emulation is a pure waste of brain power, because brains are not good at doing PC jobs, else we would never have invented them. 
    
    `index x length` model I find most problematic of all, as again there's nothing of length `2`, so it is confusing. `4` seems okay until you need to modify it. For the previous two models `reverse AxB` as well as `AxB + offset` work fine, but for `index x length` you need `as-pair value/1 + value/2 negate value/2` and `AxB + (1x0 * offset)` respectively, and it's a mess.
    
    And I also see this feature as a poor man's substitute for the `range!` datatype, so I'd prefer it to stay within segment thinking (until such datatype is implemented).
    
    P.S. There's also `copy/part series N` <=> `copy/part series 0xN` equivalence (versus `N` <=> `1x(N+1)`)

    Why should pair `/part` args even work with linear series? I understand the
    desire to leverage it, but everywhere we seem to do this today is hard to
    understand. We need `range!` for this, but even that isn't a *great* fit
    with `/part`. It needs its own interface.
