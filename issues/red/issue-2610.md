Playing around with file I/O I discovered this:

`request-dir/title {Usual title, nothing criminal}`

Everything's fine, but see what happens then I use **^** and **&**:
`request-dir/title {Nietzsche rocks! ^_^ He wrote "Beyond Good & Evil"}`

I don't know `View` that much to test it with similar GUI elements, perhaps it's not only `request-dir`-related. ðŸ˜• 
Also, there might be more such glitchy characters out there.

    @9214 
    - `^` has special meaning in Rebol/Red string, you need to type `^^` to insert a caret. [More details here](http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/string.html).
    - `&` is used for underline the character on Windows. We'll see how to deal with it as the other platforms no such feature.

    Thanks for clarifying @qtxie !
    
    `request-dir/title "^^ &Underline"`

    Meanwhile I'll stick to `and` instead of `&` :^)

    You can display an & by doubling it in the string:
    `request-dir/title "You && Me ^^_^^"`

    I noted this on Wiki [Request-file-and-Request-dir](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BDOC%5D-Request-file-and-Request-dir), this issue can be closed.
