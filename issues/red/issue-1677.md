This gist https://gist.github.com/iArnold/fd0f69c846697514d70c
contains the sourcecode that gives me some trouble.
Compiling triggers Norman endpoint protection with a Trojan warning Gen: Trojan.KS.1, automatically quarantaining and removing the .exe file.
So using Red Console to test the script
First no colored block is displayed. Then press (Red) button now the block appears as a black box. After pressing (Black) the block turns purple (as expected) and pressing (Red) button now makes the block green (also expected)
