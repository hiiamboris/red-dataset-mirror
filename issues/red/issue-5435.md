#5435: Append binary in func leaks
================================================================================

**Describe the bug**
Appending to a binary value within a function only works as intended the first time the function is called. After that there's a memory leak that causes wrong behavior.

This could be same issue as https://github.com/red/red/issues/5320 except I'm not using `/part` and my issue only happens in a `func`.

**To reproduce**
```red
Red []

;When not in a func this works as expected
print ["#{00} == " append #{} 0]
print ["#{00} == " append #{} 0]
print ""

;However a func has some kind of memory leak (interpret vs compile doesn't make a difference)
funky: func[][print ["#{01} == " append #{} 1]]
probe :funky
funky
probe :funky
funky
print ""

;This work around ignores the issue. It allows the functionality to work but internally it will still keep building forever
funky: func[][print ["#{02} == " append clear #{} 2]]
probe :funky
funky
probe :funky
funky
```

**Expected behavior**
```
#{00} ==  #{00}
#{00} ==  #{00}

func [][print ["#{01} == " append #{} 1]]
#{01} ==  #{01}
func [][print ["#{01} == " append #{} 1]]
#{01} ==  #{01}

func [][print ["#{02} == " append clear #{} 2]]
#{02} ==  #{02}
func [][print ["#{02} == " append clear #{} 2]]
#{02} ==  #{02}
```

**Actual behavior**
```
#{00} ==  #{00}
#{00} ==  #{00}

func [][print ["#{01} == " append #{} 1]]
#{01} ==  #{01}
func [][print ["#{01} == " append #{01} 1]]
#{01} ==  #{0101}

func [][print ["#{02} == " append clear #{} 2]]
#{02} ==  #{02}
func [][print ["#{02} == " append clear #{02} 2]]
#{02} ==  #{02}
```

    Thanks for the well-written report! üëç However, that is part of the core language semantics, so not a bug: https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BDOC%5D-Why-you-have-to-copy-series-values

    That response was polite and educational. Looks like what I expected isn't how red is expected to behave. It's not a bug, it's a performance feature. I like the idea of avoiding unnecessary copies so I like this feature. Thanks.
