Not critical issue maybe, since GUI console opens

    How do you start it in Wine? Could you provide the full command-line?

    This issue did not occur in the latest build of 21 Feb. There were no starting messages also, except these two..
    Compiling compression library... 
    Compiling Red GUI console...
    
    @dockimbel Did you solve this or it corrected on its own due to some other changes in code?

    @RedJosh It was probably solved by [this fix](https://github.com/red/red/commit/04deb73e0d2a1915735c73d1c404db7bd9508691) from @qtxie.

    @dockimbel Although I do not understand why the other black terminal remains open. I cannot do any thing with it. If I close it, Red Gui closes. I started Red by double-click on the Red exe. 
    
    If I start Red from X terminal - with this command ..
    wine /home/satish/Downloads/red/red-21feb16-667d309.exe
    I get lots of messages after which Red Gui console opens properly as above but it is detached from X terminal. Thereafter, I can close the X terminal and Red Console remains open.
    
    Just an observation.
