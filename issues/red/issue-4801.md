**Describe the bug**

On-over events' code first messes up `pane` of the window badly, then crashes.
![](https://i.gyazo.com/a5032032871af6047f6517d8a77e0469.gif)

If you close it before the crash you'll see in the output:
```
VIEW: WARNING: free null window handle!
VIEW: WARNING: free null window handle!
VIEW: WARNING: free null window handle!
```

Two stack traces have been observed:

**To reproduce**

Use this code which juggles the z-order (`append` can be replaced by `insert` just the same):
```
Red []

print indent: ""
arrows1: tail ">>>>>>"
arrows2: tail "<<<<<<"

enum: function [] [
	prin [indent "PANE STATE: "]
	foreach f p/pane [
		prin [f/extra ":" either f/state ["OK  "]["NONE"] " "]
	]
	print ""
]

hover: function [face event] [
	print [indent skip arrows1 -1 - length? indent "hover" face/extra]
	append indent "^-"
	enum
    either where: find/same p/pane face [
    	;-- uncomment the following line for faster crash in CLI console
	    ; repeat i length? pane: face/parent/pane [? pane/:i]
	    print [indent "removing face" face/extra]
	    remove where
    	enum
	    print [indent "adding face" face/extra]
	    append p/pane face
    	enum
	][
		print [indent "!! NOT IN PANE:" face/extra]
	]
	take/last indent
	print [indent " " skip arrows2 -1 - length? indent face/extra]
]

view p: layout [
	at 10x10 box 200x200 draw [translate 100x100            fill-pen #FF000030 circle 0x-40 50] extra 'R on-over :hover
	at 10x10 box 200x200 draw [translate 100x100 rotate 60  fill-pen #FFFF0030 circle 0x-40 50] extra 'Y on-over :hover
	at 10x10 box 200x200 draw [translate 100x100 rotate 120 fill-pen #00FF0030 circle 0x-40 50] extra 'G on-over :hover
	at 10x10 box 200x200 draw [translate 100x100 rotate 180 fill-pen #00FFFF30 circle 0x-40 50] extra 'C on-over :hover
	at 10x10 box 200x200 draw [translate 100x100 rotate 240 fill-pen #0000FF30 circle 0x-40 50] extra 'B on-over :hover
	at 10x10 box 200x200 draw [translate 100x100 rotate 300 fill-pen #FF00FF30 circle 0x-40 50] extra 'M on-over :hover
]
```
Just hover the mouse around for a minute or so. In GUI console it crashes sooner.

Need a better (more automated) way to reproduce it, but I can't think of one so far.

What happens here:
1. `on-over` event gets often generated **during** the call to `remove`, so in the output we can see event depth reaching 5-6 easily
2. Call to `on-over` happens somewhere from inside `face!/on-deep-change*`, so the pane gets unexpectedly modified during it, and a wrong face gets removed when it finishes! See the log before and after `remove` of the same depth level.
3. As a result the pane ends up having duplicate of some faces and other faces are not present at all when the event fires, e.g. `PANE STATE: R : OK    Y : OK    M : OK    M : OK    M : OK    B : OK` tells us that Magenta face appears 3 times, and Green and Cyan ones are lost.
4. The havoc above happens very fast, but it takes some time (10-100 seconds) to crash it, and I've no clue what is causing the crash so far. `remove` calls `on-deep-change*`, which calls `on-change*`, during both `show` gets called a few times, and then I'm hopelessly lost on what's happening

#4800 may be affecting this bug as well.

**Expected behavior**

1) no crashes
2) no duplicated or lost faces
3) more predictable event chain, one that is possible to reason about and debug
4) maybe events should be queued when inside another event code rather than fired immediately? not sure, this model may have other drawbacks

    No crashes anymore, but it froze my win10 after playing it a while. ðŸ˜“

    Can you test it on W7? I don't have access to it anymore.

    We don't support W7 anymore.

    We need to make a matrix of what Redbol versions run on which platforms. I know a lot of businesses didn't want to move off WIn7, but it is officially unsupported now, so that's one of those things that a FOSS community has to take on if they need it. We have to pick our battles. Given the new roadmap and refocusing targets, I think we really need to look farther ahead than behind. Otherwise 64-bit will be the least of our problems.
