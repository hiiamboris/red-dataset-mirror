**Describe the bug**

`OS-image/get-data` doesn't have any zero handle checks:
https://github.com/red/red/blob/7d01c85e84c208e6b64544bde295e90733eb21c0/runtime/platform/image-gdiplus.reds#L306-L317

and usually receives the result of `OS-image/lock-bitmap-fmt` which in case of any error returns *zero*:
https://github.com/red/red/blob/7d01c85e84c208e6b64544bde295e90733eb21c0/runtime/platform/image-gdiplus.reds#L266-L280

In effect, when image is empty, I'm having crashes from calling [`image/acquire-buffer`](https://github.com/red/red/blob/7d01c85e84c208e6b64544bde295e90733eb21c0/runtime/datatypes/image.reds#L16) in R/S code, or from using `sort`:
```
i: make image! 0x0
sort reduce [i i]
```
```

```

**Expected behavior**

No crashes on Red level.
`acquire-buffer` and `get-data` might at least have an assertion about that.

**Platform version (please complete the following information)**
```
Red 0.6.4 for Windows built 31-Jan-2020/17:12:41+03:00 commit #414cdb3
```

    Should we throw an error when making an invalid image? 
    ```
    make image! 0x0
    make image! nx0
    make image! 0xn
    make image! -nx-m
    ```

    If we allow `make image! 0x0`, then we'll have problem when `save` it to some image formats (issue #4293). Some formats don't allow it, even it is allowed by the specs of some image formats, almost no libraries allow it in practical.

    Maybe SAVE should throw an error when it's not serialized but exported in a specific format?
    There is one (if small) practical point in having image of 0x0 size internally: less checks in "crop this - inspect contents - overlay it here" kind of code, as it just doesn't affect anything.

    There's actually one more practical point in having an empty image:
    ```
    >> i: make image! 2x2
    == make image! [2x2 #{FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF}]
    >> copy skip i 4
    == make image! [0x0 #{}]
    ```
    This code has to be valid in Red

    Image is a series, and series can be empty. I think image should also be allowed to be empty. Or at least add info to documentation and create checks on invalid values, because they are not obvious.

    Interesting discussion in Python's Pillow:

    There is an image as a Red `image!` value in memory, and then there is its serialized representation as an image file stored on disk â€” don't confuse the two.
    
    The former can (and should) be zero, the latter is impractical and in some cases nigh impossible (as @qtxie [already pointed out](https://github.com/red/red/issues/4294#issuecomment-585097908)).
