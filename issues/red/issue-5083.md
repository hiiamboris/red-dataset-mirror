**Describe the bug**

Two scripts, the only difference is `return`:
1. `view [base red black "1. click me" on-down [view [field blue green "2. close me"]] return text "3. try to close the window"]`
2. `view [base red black "1. click me" on-down [view [field blue green "2. close me"]] text "3. try to close the window"]`

**To reproduce**

Just follow the numbers 1,2,3.

**Expected behavior**

Window is not reopened, like in 2nd example.

    Similar scenario, `text` instead of `base` is even worse (can't be closed):
    `view [text 80x80 red black "1. click me" on-up [view [field blue green "2. close me"]]]`

    Why the `return` makes the difference? ðŸ˜…
