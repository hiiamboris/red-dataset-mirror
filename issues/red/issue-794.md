Please refer to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23278159/what-is-a-shared-static-library

In short, I don't believe there is such a think as a shared static library, which is mentioned in the roadmap many times. Furthermore, either shared library or dynamic library should be used.

    Good catch. Indeed, a bad choice of words, most probably caused by copy/pasting the completion bars HTML code around. It is quite interesting that no-one noticed it before...

    Texts are now fixed on roadmap page.
