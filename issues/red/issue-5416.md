**Describe the bug**

It turns out that shapes drawn with `line-width 0` are slower than with `pen off`:
- on W10 up to 9-10 times
- on GTK up to 3 times
```

**To reproduce**

Run this script:
```
Red []

about/debug
by: make op! :as-pair
b1: [line-width 0 fill-pen black]
b2: [line-width 0 fill-pen black shape [line]]
b3: [line-width 0 fill-pen black shape []]
repeat i 1000 [
	h: random 100
	repend b1 ['box (i - 1 by 0) (i by h)]
	repend b2/shape [(i - 1 by 0) (i - 1 by h) (i by h) (i by 0)]
	repend b3/shape ['hline i - 1 'vline h 'hline i 'vline 0]
]
append b2/shape [close]
append b3/shape [close]

i: make image! 1000x100
;; test identicity of shapes:
; ? (draw copy i b1)
; ? (draw copy i b2)
; ? (draw copy i b3)
print "line-width 0"
clock/times [draw i b1] 1000
clock/times [draw i b2] 1000
clock/times [draw i b3] 1000
change b1 [pen off]
change b2 [pen off]
change b3 [pen off]
print "pen off"
clock/times [draw i b1] 1000
clock/times [draw i b2] 1000
clock/times [draw i b3] 1000
```

**Expected behavior**

Equally fast operation.
