GUI console does not let you select with the mouse, after at least one evaluation, unless you go down a line.

Was fine up to at least 15-Feb-2022.

**To reproduce**

1) Enter anything in the console and press Enter to evaluate it.
2) Try to drag the mouse across any single line to select it.

**Expected behavior**

Select text without having to drag down a line.


**Platform version**

    This issue was introduced in this commit eb804cf81ecdd0c7a7809e713ce78f7c09cbf668.
    
    No idea why it causes the issue. There is no `text` and `field` face used in the gui-console.

    Because `type` is being set to the guessed datatype, when it's the face style. My guess at a glance. Why it triggers that code I don't know, having not worked on it before.

    You almost nailed it. Issue is, `type` is a newly introduced local which now shadows the `face/type` which needs qualified prefix.
    I'm surprised it works at all in this state ;)

    Ah yes, `function` in use. I sometimes miss details when viewing bits on github. Thanks @hiiamboris. :+1:
