sin 1.#inf      ==> 1.#NaN
arcsine 1.#inf  ==> "math or number overflow"
tan 1.#inf      ==> 1.#NaN
arctangent 1.#inf ==> 90.0

Would expect 1.#NaN for the ARCSINE.

No sure best behavior for ARCTANGENT. Technically, 90.0 is right -- but only for certain values of infinity.

    Maybe related: #2000

    Technically, `sin 1.#inf` should return a range `[-1, 1]`, `arcsine 1.#inf` should return a complex number `(-i)âˆž`.
    As we granted wish #2000, for consistency, I think we should also return `1.#NaN` for `arcsine 1.#inf`.

    @qtxie Agreed.
