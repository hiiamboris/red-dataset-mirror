**Describe the bug**
On macOS, if you use "alert" from within a modal window, the alert will display, but the whole application is then locked.  You can't close the alert, either by clicking the "Close" button, or by clicking the "x" icon.  The same thing happens if you use a home-grown modal window instead of the alert.

**To reproduce**
Run the following code on macOS:

`Red [needs: 'view]`

`view/flags [`
    `    title "Modal test"`    
    `    size 250x100`
    `    below`
    `    text "This window is modal"`
    `    button "Show an alert" [ alert "Can you close this ?" ]`
`] [ modal ]`

Click the "Show an alert" button, then try to close the alert message.

**Expected behavior**
The alert message will not close, and you are forced to quit the entire application.
