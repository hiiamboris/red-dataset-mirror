Right now `-c -t (other OS)` works like `-r`, and this takes a while.
Would be nice to support fast cross compilation.

    I agree this would be nice. Do we put the onus on the user to make sure they target different dirs, so the runtimes stay separate?

    I think so. And the most likely combo `.dll` & `.so` won't cause conflict anyway.
