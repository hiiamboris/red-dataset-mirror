#126: WISH: minimum width measurement of a rich-text face

I've been inquiring into how to better autofit grid columns to their content, and one of the factors to consider is "don't make columns narrower than the longest word they contain".

Currently the only way to figure out "how wide is the longest word?" that I see is to replace all spaces with new-lines and call `size-text`.

It would be nice to have this info without text modification.
