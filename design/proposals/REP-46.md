Currently you can build a Shared libRed like so:

~~~
red build libRed
~~~

however it appears Red has no option to build a Static libRed.

    @cup that's correct. It's not on our roadmap, so I'll close this ticket for now.

    @89z, please stop trolling. You just did this on HN and were called out for it. You *know* your argument is incorrect and specious, and cherry-picking data points won't change that.
