#33: WISH: more ways to save the history in GUI console

Currently history is saved by Alt+F4 only. Wish for more options:
1) with `q`/`quit` invocation (a habit of typing `<q>`+`<enter>`)
2) with a custom command, like `save-history` (otherwise I have to restart it before typing a command that I expect to crash it)

    `q` and `quit` can be overwritten by GUI Console to save the settings (font, color etc.) and the history.
