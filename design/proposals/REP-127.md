#127: WISH: wrapping type should be user defined

Once text length has been calculated text should show entirely if possible and/or user should be able to decide in which way text "wraps" when it is created/resized:
none = clipped
'clipped = clipped (stays on one line if it is resized)
'wrap = wrapped  (is wrapped and clipped if space is not enough)
'ellipsize = ellipsized (stays on one line but is ellipsized if it is resized)
'auto-scroller(s)

Same words should be available in VID.

    This is about `text` face and control of ellipsization in it (which is automatic right now).
