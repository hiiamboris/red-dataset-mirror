#128: WISH: preprocessor context to be available to macro rules block
================================================================================
Issue is open, was reported by hiiamboris and has 4 comment(s).
<https://github.com/red/REP/issues/128>

Script:
```
Red []
#do [abc: 0]
#macro ['macro1 (prin "in rules " ?? abc)] func [s e] [abc: 1000 prin "in body " ?? abc []]
macro1
macro1 
prin "in code " ?? abc
```
Outputs:
```
in rules abc: unset!
in body abc: 1000
in rules abc: unset!
in body abc: 1000
in code abc: unset!
```
I would prefer it to output:
```
in rules abc: 0
in body abc: 1000
in rules abc: 1000
in body abc: 1000
in code abc: unset!
```

    Specific use case is to enable/disable some macro from other macros. Rules and macro body need to access the same data.

    Would also keep those from leaking out into `system/words`.
