This was previously red issue [2878](https://github.com/red/red/issues/2878) opened by @greggirwin.

Design TBD, but asking for a specific datatype could list them first. Asking for `datatype!` could list them like doc strings for funcs. 

I also considered how to include typeset info for datatypes. Needs some thought though.
