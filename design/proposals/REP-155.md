#155: Another lament on Redbin limitations, or why sparse designs are bound to be reinvented until complete
================================================================================

In my recent work on [ParSEE visualization tool](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces/src/branch/master/programs#parsee-parsing-flow-visual-analysis-tool-parsee-tool-red) I've encountered the need to save the dump of all Parse events, to later load it in the GUI tool to analyze.

Reasons for such split design are:
1. Spaces (on which GUI tool is built upon) are a big library. Requiring it at the place of parsing would be unwise because:
   - countless #include bugs will make usage of such tool pure hell, so no one will use it
   - such a big library is likely to affect the original program (consider custom event scheduler, custom `mold` implementation, hacked console, and many exports)
2. Requiring GUI would require GUI functionality, which is not always available (say, on headless servers), and would limit the applicability of the tool
3. It is simply convenience sometimes to save multiple results and process them later, without the need to reproduce them every time (also useful if hard to reproduce)

While point 1 could in theory be addressed in some far far future by a solid module system that could provide enough convenience and isolation, points 2-3 will remain valid, validating the whole need for backend/frontend separation.

Saved dump consists of thousands of events, each including `input` Parse is working on and `rule` processing the input:
- input of Parse can be nested and even cyclic, and it can contain arbitrary Red values (natives, faces with handles, etc.)
- rules can also be nested, cyclic, and linked to each other indirectly via words, and contain arbitrary code, which usually includes natives

Traditional mold/load cycle is inappropriate as it would destroy both sameness and offsets of all series:
- if event A and event B have the *same* rule, it should remain same once loaded, and it should preserve the head index
- all nested sub-series of input once loaded must retain sameness across all events: if event A has input X containing input Y, and event B has input Y, then Y of both must be the *same* value, else I won't know where to mark the current parsing location

Redbin was supposed to be of help here, but its shortcomings make it a kludge rather than a solution.

Current Redbin implementation cannot save:
- values of types `routine! handle! event! op!`
- values within `system/words` context

So when I try to save such dump of values I only receive an error most of the time.

**To force Redbin to save** the dump I had to recursively preprocess whole tree of values (including both input and events dump) in the following manner:
1. Copy each any-block series and keep a map [old block -> new block] - needed for (2)
2. Replace each any-block with it's copy from the map (1) - needed for (3-5), as I cannot modify the original rules/input in place or I'll break the parser
3. Bind every word to the global context so it loses its binding during Redbin encoding (it's a special case in Redbin at the moment)
4. Replace complex (objects, maps, functions) values with their abbreviations, as I don't need their content because Parse cannot enter them. This helps me avoid deep preprocessing of these values
5. Replace values unsupported by Redbin by their abbreviations

For more general preprocessing I would also need include objects, maps and functions into the deeply preprocessed data set.

In essence, it's a slow **high-level reinvention of the logic of Redbin**, which by my observation is also quite hard to get done correctly and reasonably fast. **It would thus be nice if Redbin didn't require invention of such kludges in order to just use it.**

    That was not part of Redbin goal, which was to provide a way to serialize local Red data accurately without pulling the entirety of the global context (== whole Red runtime environment). Even in its current form, Redbin is already pulling some parts of the global context, which is not always desirable. A possible evolution of Redbin could include a way to control how "far" it pulls references, so the user can scale it for its specific needs.

    Thanks for correcting me, I've removed natives and actions from that list.

    I understand, yes. But local data may include global words that need to be saved, or it may contain words like `system` which enforce unwanted global context inclusion, so in real code it becomes a tangled mess in need of deep and meticulous preprocessing.

    Perhaps the easiest patch would be to let it accept a callback, either to handle all values, or only those it can't save, rather than failing. And some `save-anything` callback available out of the box.
    
    But these are just some thoughts and a use case to inform the big picture.

    I had other thoughts on Redbin generality [here](https://github.com/red/red/issues/4126#issuecomment-902281364)

    The big picture thinking, and a real use case like this, is great. Thanks @hiiamboris. :+1:

    Another illustration of how bad it gets - saving two scalar values, carrying over the whole runtime:
    ```
    f: function [geom [map!]] [
    	unless geom/offset [geom/offset: 0x0]
    	unless geom/size   [geom/size: system/view/screens/1/size]
    	save %test.redbin probe geom
    	view/options [button "TEST" [unview]] [size: geom/size offset: geom/offset]
    ]
    f #()
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    #(
        offset: 0x0
        size: 1280x720
    )
    *** Access Error: cannot decode or encode (no codec): routine ["Internal Use Only"][bool: as red-logic! stack/arguments bool/header: T
    *** Where: encode
    *** Near : codec/encode :value dst
    *** Stack: f save
    ```
    I have to use text for state files module, because Redbin is a no-go. Of course that bears another risk.

    That last example looks like a bug where the words in the map are wrongly pulling their context instead of being processed just as symbols.

    Is it a bug in Redbin not having a special case for maps, or in maps for not removing words binding then?

    I'm pretty sure that's by design of `map!` itself:
    
    ```red
    >> map: to map! bind [foo: 'bar] context [foo: 'baz]
    == #[
        foo: 'bar
    ]
    >> get probe last keys-of map
    foo
    == baz
    >> unset? :foo
    == true
    ```
    
    > provide a way to serialize local Red data accurately
    
    Which it evidently does, judging by the example above 🤷‍♂️
    
    > special case for maps
    
    For the record, at the time of implementation I didn't know there supposed to be one. IIRC all there is to `map!` is a convenient key/value wrapper over `hash!`.

    WRT inability to encode global values, I think it can be rectified by collecting them in a separate context, which would serve as a localized substitute for `system/words`. Basically:
    
    ```red
    >> foo: 'bar
    == bar
    >> save/as #{} [foo] 'redbin
    ```
    
    Would be the same as:
    
    ```red
    >> save/as #{} bind [foo] context [foo: system/words/foo] 'redbin
    ```
    
    As for the other possibility, with unmarshaling values from Redbin payload straight into `system/words`: imagine `load`ing an innocious payload where global `+` is set to a function that reads your home folder, sends its content over the network, and then blows up your PC. Next time you'll evaluate anything in Red it will likely do just that.
