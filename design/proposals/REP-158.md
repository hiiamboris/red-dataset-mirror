Will be useful for some animated transitions, e.g. (dis)appearance of whole UI layout. Imagine two layouts: `layout1` and `layout2` and their opacities tied as `opacity1(t) + opacity2(t) = 1`.

Currently it's only possible by rendering this layout on an image and modifying opacity of all pixels of that image, which is rather heavy. 

Need to check if Draw backends have support for this, but since it's a core SVG feature the bet is on.
