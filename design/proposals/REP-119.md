#119: WISH: `tuple/i: n` to work on empty parts
================================================================================

Currently to for example turn a tuple into 3-tuple one has to promote it into 4-tuple first (or check `length?` of it):
```
>> c: 0.0.0       ;) imagine we don't know if C has 3 or 4 components
>> c/4: none
*** Script Error: value out of range: none
*** Where: set-path
*** Near : none
*** Stack:  

>> c: c + 0.0.0.0
== 0.0.0.0
>> c/4: none
== none
>> c
== 0.0.0
```
I propose:
- `tuple/i: none` does nothing when `i > length? tuple`
- `tuple/i: number` when `i > length? tuple` adds zeroes up to `i` and sets i-th component to `number`

`value out of range: none` is also a bugged error message

    That it's a scalar, along with date, time, and pair, is interesting. We don't have a description for scalars. They are non-series, but those I just mentioned are pseudo-singular values. If we say it's because they support math ops, these types are still special because of setting parts of them to `none` for example. Not saying we need a new typeset, just trying to think of what will drive @meijeru the least crazy.
