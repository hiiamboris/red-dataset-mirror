Map is not part of `series!` typeset currently, not it is accepted by `modify` native, so it is currently impossible to place any reactions on changes in the map. Which limits it's usage a lot.

However I know internally it's just `hash!`. So this limitation is artificial. Using `hash!` in place of `map!` though involves a lot of micromanagement, so not acceptable either.

Ideally I'd like map to be series like @giesse proposes. But it's another topic. For the scope of this wish it would be enough that:
- map keys could be used as sources for reactive relations
- any change could be caught by on-deep-change
