#139: WISH: list fonts available in the system
================================================================================

Modern tendency in UIs seems to be choosing the font name from a drop-down list, but in Red the only way to choose a font is to call a system requester dialog `request-font`.

It would be nice to have a way to list all installed font names.

    I worked on this same issue for R2 with someone many years ago. Might be in
    the rebol.org library.
