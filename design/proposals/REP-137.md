For future consideration/implementation.

Currently it's supported by low-level dialect, but not by high-level:
```
view [rich-text "abcdefghij" data [3x4 bold 5x4 underline]]
view [rich-text data ["ab" b "cd" u "ef" /b "gh" /u "ij"]]
```

Nenad's stance:
> I have nothing against supporting a RTD syntax that allows for overlaps. RTD allows both tags and "undecorated" tag names. We could relax the constraints on that alternative form to allow overlappings, while keeping the tags version conform to HTML rules.
