A direct follow-up to https://github.com/red/red/issues/3359: I wish `body-of` (ditto `reflect ... 'body`) applied to `action!`s and `native!`s yielded their respective IDs, the way `second` in Rebol2 does.
```rebol
>> second :find
== 53
```
The rationale is simple â€” while one can use IDs to re-create actions and natives (as indicated in the linked issue above), obtaining these IDs requires manual inspection of runtime tables ([this](https://github.com/red/red/blob/7d01c85e84c208e6b64544bde295e90733eb21c0/runtime/macros.reds#L70) and [this](https://github.com/red/red/blob/7d01c85e84c208e6b64544bde295e90733eb21c0/runtime/macros.reds#L148)).
