While I agree with https://github.com/red/red/issues/2338 reasoning that object->map conversion is dangerous, at the same time from time to time I have to go through the odd object->block->map route (which is also [lossy atm](https://github.com/red/red/issues/5140)), and I remember it was being requested by others.

The use case rests on these issues:
- objects are not extensible
- maps do not evaluate the spec

So by writing
```
map: to map! to block! object [
    func1: func [args] [body...]
    ...
]
```
I can create a set of functions (or objects with functions) that is safely extensible at runtime.

I've counted 8 occurrences of that in my code, and there's also sometimes a trick to make the spec more human-readable (but it's of low importance):
`to map! to [] object [dec: sci: pct: none]` instead of:
`#[dec: #[none] sci: #[none] pct: #[none]]`

Of course if we plan to make objects extensible, this would obsolete this wish.
