#117: WISH: insert-event-func to check for dupes

This has been discussed but never documented: `insert-event-func` should not add a function that's already in the pipeline.

Currently, one has to *always* write:
```
	unless find/same system/view/handlers :event-func [
		insert-event-func :event-func
	]
```
instead of just
```
insert-event-func :event-func
```

Needless to say, people are also unknowingly falling into the trap of not checking for the duplicates and blowing up the event pipeline.

    If there is no good reason to _allow_ dupe event funcs, and I can't think of one, we should probably consider this a bug rather than a REP. @qtxie @dockimbel what do you think?

    This should not have been a REP, just a normal ticket, as it's just a very simple code improvement.
