Since clipping regions are affected by the transformation matrix and having a block! adds a level of indirection I wish that instead of:
```
...unclipped draw commands...
clip <start> <end> [
	...clipped draw commands...
]
...unclipped draw commands...
```
I could do;
```
...unclipped draw commands...
clip <start> <end>
..clipped draw commands...
unclip ; or clip off or clip none or whatever
...unclipped draw commands...
