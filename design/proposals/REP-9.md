[Wish]
<https://github.com/red/REP/issues/9>

In reaction to a wish in red/red#1188, (now closed), I was told
```
The current implementaton is partial, just to cover some simple needs.
We are planning to make a full implementation very soon, maybe even in the 0.5.4 release.
As this ticket asks for a feature already planned, it will be closed.
```
Since nothing has happened since then, I repeat this wish here, if only for the record.

Syntax: `#[ <type> <type-dependent info>]`, for all values of `<type>`. Also:
`#[ <word> ]` for predefined `<word>`s viz. `none, true, false` and the type(set) names.

The facility as implemented in Rebol may serve as a starting point
