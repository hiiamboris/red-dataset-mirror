Read here: https://github.com/greggirwin/red-hof/blob/master/code-analysis/iterators.md

Based off my experience with the [extended `*each` loops](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-common/src/branch/master/foreach-design.md) and crafted to work together with the [`node!` datatype proposal](https://github.com/red/REP/issues/57), and `range!` (including series slices).
