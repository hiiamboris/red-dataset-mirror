I've planted a few flowers here:
https://github.com/red/red/wiki/[PROP]-Series-evolution

Let's see if they are destined to grow.

I'd like to see what the community thinks before I continue â˜»

What do you think of the ideas and goals expressed there?

    Making matrices with each function is an interesting idea but don't you need something more, like tensors or hyper matrices of order 3+?
    In my opinion, something interactive where you could turn off/on refinements would be nice.
