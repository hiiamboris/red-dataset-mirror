#113: WISH: `get-quiet` routine or /quiet (or /safe) refinement for `get` action on paths

I often have to write long code to guard against path errors, e.g.:
`width: all [layout layout/size layout/size/x]`

This is a long known pain point since Rebol with no good solution.

`attempt [layout/size/x]` is often used in this situation, but it's only acceptable in low-performance code parts (which in my code are usually very few):
```
>> o: object [x: 2x3 y: none]
>> clock/times [all [o o/a o/a/x] all [o o/b o/b/x]] 1e6
0.81 μs	[all [o o/a o/a/x] all [o o/b o/b/x]]
>> clock/times [attempt [o/a/x] attempt [o/b/x]] 1e6
3.98 μs	[attempt [o/a/x] attempt [o/b/x]]
```

I propose adding an efficient `get/quiet 'layout/size/x` call which if any of the path items are not accessible, instead of erroring out would return `none`.

    What about `safe` as a refinement/routine name? Aligns with `do-safe` and `attempt/safer`. There's also a slight mismatch in behavior today, because `set` does _not_ error when trying to set a word that doesn't exist in a context. Just as `do-safe` is marked for internal use, `get-safe` aligns with that as a routine. I can see people wanting to use it regularly though, simply because checking for `none` seems nicer in many cases than handling errors.

    The object in the example should be: `o: object [a: 2x3 b: none]` else there would be uncaught error:
    ```
    >> all [o o/a o/a/x]
    *** Script Error: cannot access a in path o/a
    ```
