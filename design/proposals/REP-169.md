I want to create a GUI which enlarges laterally on the press of a button, as do some task bars and then hide. This is a test script and I am encountering a problems: visible trails and flickering, when resizing even with `auto-sync?: false` and manual syncing.
Click "enlarge" multiple time to test it, you will see the phantom of redrawing at each change

```
system/view/auto-sync?: off
enlargement: 100

view l: layout [
	p: panel 80x150 [
		Below
		Button "UltraEdit" 60x50 [
		]		
		pad 0x20
		button "Enlarge" [
			case [
				face/extra = none [
					l/offset/x: l/offset/x - enlargement
					l/size/x: l/size/x + enlargement
					p/offset/x: p/offset/x + enlargement 
					face/extra: 'enlarged
					show l
					show p
				]
				face/extra = 'enlarged [
					l/offset/x: l/offset/x + enlargement
					l/size/x: l/size/x - enlargement
					p/offset/x: p/offset/x - enlargement
					face/extra: none
					show l		
					show p
				]
				
			]
			
		]			
	]
]
```

I expected that all drawing are done after showing the panel but it seems it happens after that, redrawing the with the previous values and then with the new one. Hiiamboris thinks that internally offset and size are updated in two separate moments.

It would be nice to fix this beaviour to reach clean, no trails and flickering free updating

    An error in your code: shop p must be replaced by show p
