From time to time I happen to need to work with [ndjson](https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec) data. It is trivial enough to de/encode via json codec, but it seems to be common enough to have out of the box support.

    I see that used in LLM servers API, so pretty widely used nowadays.
    
    I guess that should be supported as a port scheme, inheriting from the HTTP scheme.
