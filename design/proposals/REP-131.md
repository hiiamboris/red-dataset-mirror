I wish that color names and their values would be located somewhere else then in `system/words` so I can simply find and/or list them or one of them.

    Good idea.
    Meanwhile you can use @9214's opus magnum:
    `exclude sort extract load help-string tuple! 2 [transparent glass]`

    Yes, I found that. But I was searcing for a script that was able to show the color names because I didn't found them when I searched in `system` and never know the `help tuple!` trick. Next time will I remember the `help` trick, the @9214 trick or the other script name ?
