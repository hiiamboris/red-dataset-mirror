## View interfacing

Currently in the prototype implementation in [`table-view`](https://github.com/red/red/tree/table-view) branch, all the header and content items are stored in a 2D block in `/data` facet:

```
view make face! [
    type: 'window
    offset: 400x200
    size: 600x600
    pane: reduce [
	make face! [
	    type: 'table
	    offset: 10x10
	    size: 300x300
	    data: [
	        ["Col1" "Col2"  "Col3"]
	        ["A"    "9"	"8"]
	        ["B"    "789"	"6"]
	        ["C"    "0"	"-5"]
	        ["D"    "1234"	"4"]
	        ["E"    "3"	"0"]
	    ]
        ]
    ]
]
```

That facet is meant to be reactive, so that any change there would be immediately reflected in the displayed table (not implemented yet).

Though, columns options need a place where to specify their properties. Also, if we want to support per-cell visual properties, we need a simple/efficient way to specify it.

Here is a simple test example on Windows 11 (23H4):
