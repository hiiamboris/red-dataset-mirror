Then programs written in Red could adapt their UI without the need for restart.

Red already [handles WM_THEMECHANGED message](https://github.com/red/red/blob/9b63b53b8167339677e90d336db7c524445eceec/modules/view/backends/windows/events.reds#L1516) to [update some fonts](https://github.com/red/red/blob/9b63b53b8167339677e90d336db7c524445eceec/modules/view/backends/windows/gui.reds#L696), so logically colors could be the next target

Another missing piece is making `system/view/metrics` a reactor, so code would know when to update the UI. And triggering it's `on-change*` from R/S code, because maps it contains won't trigger it.
