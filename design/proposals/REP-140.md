    First, use the red/red repo for bug tickets. Second, raise questions in chat on gitter (now matrix) to confirm that others think it's a bug. But to answer your question, it's evaluation order that is tripping you up, because `and` is an (infix)  `op!`, so evaluates first. Play in the console to see if you can figure out what's going on, and ask in red/help chat for hints. Here's what I did to confirm that it works as I expect.
    
    ```
    >> false and true
    == false
    >> (not false) and (not true)
    == false
    >> and~ not false not true
    == false
    ```
