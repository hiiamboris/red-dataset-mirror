#176: Relax `mold/all` on strings
================================================================================
Issue is open, was reported by hiiamboris and has 16 comment(s).
<https://github.com/red/REP/issues/176>

```
>> mold/all "—Ñ—ã–≤–∞"
== {"^^(444)^^(44B)^^(432)^^(430)"}
```
There seems to be a [consensus](https://matrix.to/#/%23red_bugs%3Agitter.im/%24ofQbEQRWCnmvyskK9Fj_1Exaiytm6gC2G9AGxUwrFNQ?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org&via=nitro.chat) that this behavior is unnecessary for all valid codepoints.

Is there any reason we should prefer this obfuscating result over the original string?
```
>> mold "—Ñ—ã–≤–∞"
== {"—Ñ—ã–≤–∞"}
```

    Not just for obfuscation, but size of output, intended meaning (that is, doesn't look special or sneaky), and maybe faster loading.

    @hiiamboris I can never follow the links you are posting on Matrix, as it asks me to create a new account and it never works properly (it asks me to "reset" my account, loosing all messages, ...). Can you just give me the timestamp (the group is in clear in the URL)?
    
    NB: I tried searching for "—Ñ—ã–≤–∞" in the group, but could not find it...

    Ah, found something related searching for "mold/all" on July 30th, 16:35:35, is that the beginning of the discussion?

    Using R3 build from Rebol Source site:

    So, one problem with the wish is that it requires a terminal that can properly render Unicode characters, otherwise very bad things can happen...

    That is not a problem with the terminal, it's a problem with R3 I believe. Even the fact that it shows your input properly but not the output hints at that. 
    Same terminal:

    They never work for me, either. The internet is well and truly broken, but I admire your optimism.

    `mold/all` and terminal handling are two separate issues for this, yes? Of course they interact in the examples here, but writing to a file has the same issue. Without `/all` we still have the same issue today, as the terminal will still get unicode chars via `mold`.
