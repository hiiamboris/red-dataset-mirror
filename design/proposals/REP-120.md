#120: WISH: Pick on multiple target

Actually you can pick just one value but in some use cases, having pick return multiple data would be good. 
Table made with block of blocks is one of the most important one:

```
table: [[a b c d] [x y z w] [5 6 7 8]]
pick second table [1 3]
>>  [x z]
```

    I think your result should be `== [[x y z w] none]`

    @hiiamboris Thank you, I have copied it from Gitter where there was the error. Now it should be correct

    @GiuseppeChillemi This can be done very easily on mezz level, in this sense not everything should be added to the language as a feature:
    
        t: [x y z w]
        pick*: func [t b] [collect [forall b [keep pick t b/1]]]
        pick* t [1 3]
        ; == [x z]
    
        pick* t [1 9]
        ; == [x none]

    @endo64 You are right and I have already it at mezzanine level. I have requested this, because `pick` is a frequent use function in strict loops and implementing native would speed up data processing.

    That feature already exists using `copy/part`:
    ```
    >> table: [[a b c d] [x y z w] [5 6 7 8]]
    == [[a b c d] [x y z w] [5 6 7 8]]
    >> copy/part second table 1x3
    == [x y]
    ```

    It seems we are not talking about the same feature:
    
    My result is: 
    
    `>>  [x z]` while your is `>>  [x y]`
    
    My wish is to express the positions as single columns, so you can write:
    
    ```
    table: [[a b c d] [x y z w] [5 6 7 8]]
    pick second table [1 3 4]
    ```
    And get the result:
    
    `>>  [x z w]`

    Do we have any docs or design notes on `copy` with `pair!` parts? I remember it being there, but its design isn't great IMO.

    Indeed, I'm reopening it.
