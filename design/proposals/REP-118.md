Popup windows are still widely used on desktops: hints, menus, drop-downs, popover widgets, etc.

We are currently limited by the main window in implementation of custom (non-native) popups. Nothing can stick out of the main window. But for popups it is very common to stick out. For example if a list from a drop-down has to fit into the window, it may either be clipped by the border, or obstruct the entry field which it should appear adjacent to. Example:

Opening a new modal top level window is not a good UX: parent window should not be deactivated, and Alt-F4 should close the main window, not the new one. Besides modal is still bug-ridden.

I propose either some windows can be made non-top-level child windows of another window. That is they shouldn't appear in taskbar, shouldn't catch Alt-F4, but should be separate. Or we create a new face type that like other faces belongs to it's top level window pane, but is not clipped by window's borders (like that glitch with layered windows on W7).
