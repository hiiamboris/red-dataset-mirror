greggirwin

[03:50](#msg58fd760408c00c092aac68ad)Yes. What I still don't know is what you can do with them in Elixir. What makes them cool or useful?

gltewalt

[04:04](#msg58fd7961587a245e244064f5)Directly express binary stuff or text without jumping through type conversions.  
TCP/IP packets, SYN flooding @geekyi, direct machine code if you feel like it I reckon. Bit fiddling. Pattern matching bits. Modem commands.  
Since strings 'are' binaries it's one seamless thing, or blob of functionality.

Im sure Red covers all those bases - it's just a different approach. Libs built up on binary vs. many different types. It cuts out the need for a lot of conversion functions.

Or maybe... I'm just goofy

geekyi

[04:12](#msg58fd7b10c1d3b5015413d3f4)@gltewalt I'm not exactly sure how things are exactly represented in red. But in c and red/system too I believe, it's really quite close to the metal

[04:40](#msg58fd81ae08c00c092aac890b)Seems like every time some 'thing' gets brought up, so far, a guru shows how it's easily modelled in Red.

greggirwin

[04:41](#msg58fd8201587a245e24407c12)The difference is that Elixir seems to have a very union-like view of the data, where Red thinks in terms of distinct types as a key value proposition.

[04:41](#msg58fd82168bb56c2d11d7e96e)A dialect is where you can hide those details, in a controlled way.

[04:43](#msg58fd826d8fcce56b202e9024)And `parse` works on binary data just fine. Maybe Oldes or Bolek will jump in with examples. I have tinkerings somewhere, but don't think any of them are complete.

The deletion distance between "cat" and "bat" is 98 + 99, because you need to delete the first character of both words. Of course, the deletion distance between two strings can't be greater than the sum of their total ASCII values, because you can always just delete both of the strings entirely.Implement an efficient function to find the deletion distance between two strings.You can refer to the Wikipedia article on the algorithm for edit distance if you want to.

[18:24](#msg599dc856bc46472974b54ef1)&gt; Just doesn't seem robust enough

Not a terribly strong argument. :^)

1\) Has it caused you an actual problem?  
2\) Is there a concrete case you can see where it will?

From RFC 3986:  
&gt; the URI syntax is a federated and extensible naming system wherein each scheme's specification may further restrict the syntax and semantics of identifiers using that scheme.

Per that spec `ldap://[2001:db8::7]/c=GB?objectClass?one` is a valid URL. Do we support that?

These are other examples, and \*are* all valid in Red:

```
mailto:John.Doe@example.com
news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix
tel:+1-816-555-1212
telnet://192.0.2.16:80/
urn:oasis:names:specification:docbook:dtd:xml:4.1.2
```

[18:25](#msg599dc8a89acddb2407bffecf)In cases like this, it really helps to have concrete examples of why something should change, and also how to do it.

[18:27](#msg599dc922614889d4757c979b)It can be \*good* to match standards, but there is often also a high cost associated with it. There is also a lot of legacy design out there that doesn't need to be supported in literal form.

[18:28](#msg599dc95b2723db8d5ed5dd72)e.g., the url above with brackets in it:

```
>> to url! "ldap://[2001:db8::7]/c=GB?objectClass?one"

```

No, I haven't had a problem yet, other than surprise.  
Concrete case? I don't know. Most people will probably whip up their own parse solution if the want to look for urls, but if the do it in a non parse-fu way, theyre going to get false positives.

[18:45](#msg599dcd49ee5c9a4c5ff0ae13)and... what the heck?

```

[20:28](#msg599de556a7b406262dbd7670)&gt; we all know that cat:meow isn't an url.

Not true. As Bolek pointed out, it's a valid URL according to RFC3986. Just because I don't have a `cat` scheme doesn't mean you don't. Checking a fixed list, and telling users to change the Red lexer to support new ones, seems like a very bad idea to me. Remember, URLs aren't only useful for known schemes and net access.

`9214 10:04Can someone brewed in cryptography help me to classify cipher algorithm? * it's a block cipher (1 block = 6 bit); * it's a hashing algorithm (i.e. data is encoded as a string and passed as a text for further data validation); * it's reversible; * it has two distinct functions: 1. first function recieves an array of 16 bytes (actually 4 dwords), roughly divides it into blocks, and re-arranges these blocks according to static lookup table, giving an array of 12 blocks (i.e. bytes with our 6 bits); 2. between 1st and 2nd functions there is a small intermezzo - 10 bit checksum is computed for an array of 12 blocks; first 4 bits are ORed into 12th block, other 6 bits constitute a new 13th block. 14, 15, 16 blocks are taken from 5th dword which weren't passed through first function. Overall it gives us 16 blocks total. 3. second function recieves 16-block array and has 3 rounds: first and second rounds perform bit swapping (i.e. swap i-th bit in n-th block with j-th bit in m-th block), thirds round perform bit flipping (i.e. flip i-th bit in n-th block). Indexes i, j, m and n are computed from a static vector of numbers (I named it [initialization vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector)). Some modular arithmetic is involved. TL;DR I think that it's either a (rather simple) [sp-network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution-permutation_network), or some transposition cipher. * What are your thoughts? 11:03"re-arranging" in first function is something like "X block is 4 bits at Y1 offset in Z1 dword ORed with 2 bits at Y2 offset in Z2 dword" greggirwin 16:08@9214, maybe post in a room with more people? 9214 16:08@greggirwin I don't think it's appropriate in any other room :D 16:09anyway, I think it's a transposition cipher, since first function cannot be considered a substitution in a strict sense`

``Wednesday 30th August, 2017 gltewalt 08:57According to the sp-network link, if you reverse your process and it decrypts, then it's a SPN. "Decryption is done by simply reversing the process (using the inverses of the S-boxes and P-boxes and applying the round keys in reversed order)." 9214 09:48@gltewalt yes, that's how it works for P-box, but *substitution* in S-box implies that original data *is changed*, thereas in my case it's just transposed (permuted?) to match 6-bit block format. So it's kinda "take these bytes and put it here", not "substitute these bytes with this". gltewalt 10:03Might be a good one for: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/ 9214 10:04nay, I don't want to register on SO for one question :grimacing: gltewalt 10:23Oh 10:24Login with google Thursday 31st August, 2017 geekyi 03:00@9214 isn't on stackoverflow? :o well, I could ask.. 9214 03:27@geekyi that would be really nice!

So, meditate on a domain, write down a bunch of sentences for operating in this domain, and try to match these sentences to red-like syntax.

Try, err, change, try, err :repeat: *ad nauseam* Ah, yes, I forgot **think**. @greggirwin Thanks for suggestions!

The punctuation needs to be addressed and maybe capitalisation 19:48AND, the 800lb gorilla - syllable counting, if you want advanced piglatin 19:49like... carry would be arcay yray 19:49I probably won't mess with syllable counting though 19:51Really it's for the series manipulation experience 9214 19:53try to implement rotate with /right refinement >> rotate [a b c] 2 == [c a b] >> rotate/right [a b c] 1 == [c a b] gltewalt 19:53@9214 lol, why did I think I had to seperate my vowels? Sometimes I'm not so sure about me.... 19:55https://www.google.com/amp/m.wikihow.com/Speak-Pig-Latin%3famp=1 9214 20:05I think we have Pig Latin alternative called "brick language" (кирпичный язык) in Russia. :D Each syllable in the word is doubled and consonants in doubled syllables are substituted with code letter к. So, for example, hello is hekelloko and how do you do? is hokow doko youkyou doko? (not sure about you though). 20:07was popular in school and summer camps 20:07ah, sweet times :baby: gltewalt 20:18In Russia, pig latins you 9214 20:20:pig: gltewalt 20:21That would be more difficult, because syllable counting is hard. Or so they say. 9214 20:22start small and try to split up a word into syllables gltewalt 20:26For English, it's a bit of a "yikes" http://www.phonicsontheweb.com/syllables.php 9214 20:30indeed 20:30rough sketch syllables: func [str][ alphabet: charset [#"a" - #"z" #"A" - #"Z"] vowels: charset ["aeiou"] consonants: exclude alphabet vowels syllable: [ 0 1 consonants 1 vowels 0 1 consonants ] parse str [ collect some keep syllable ] ] probe syllables "watermelon" 20:33interesting parse challenge though greggirwin 20:58@gltewalt, for these: has-puctuation?: func [str] [parse str [punctuation]] starts-with-vowel?: func [str][parse to-string first str [vowels]] Find should be enough. Find/match for the starts-with-... functionality. gltewalt 21:00Not beneficial to break things up into funcs? greggirwin 21:01has-punctuation? doesn't seem to be used, but doesn't look like it works how you expect, unless you're parsing a single char to check for punc. gltewalt 21:01It isn't used yet. Need to write the func greggirwin 21:01You can still make funcs, just use find instead of parse. Parse is overkill, and doesn't add intent here IMO. gltewalt 21:01Ahh, ok 9214 21:06could [this](https://gist.github.com/9214/b06fd40bf71d8990146d4ed46cef191d#file-pig-latin-red-L7) be simplified btw? greggirwin 21:10vowels: charset "aeiouAEIOU" Yours doesn't work as expected either. Uppercase mods vowels in place. You also need to use /case. >> union "aeiou" "AEIOU" == "aeiou" >> union/case "aeiou" "AEIOU" == "aeiouAEIOU" 9214 21:13@greggirwin surprisingly it works as it is >> pigify "Anaphora" == "anaphoraay" 21:15perhaps i can just parse lowercase str..? :smiling_imp: greggirwin 21:16If you don't use parse/case they should be equivalent. 9214 21:17oh, indeed, I forgot that parse doesn't care about case by default gltewalt 21:39I needed the true/false returned from parse. Doesn't look like find returns true/false rebolek 21:40@gltewalt It returns value or none, that's good enough for most cases. gltewalt 21:51? starts-with-vowel?: func [str][either find to-string first str vowels [true][false]] 9214 21:56@gltewalt find to-string first str vowels should do 21:58moreover, I don't think string! conversion is needed 21:58 text >> v: charset "aeiou" == make bitset! #{000000000000000000000000444104} >> find v #"a" == true gltewalt 21:58Looking for true or false 9214 21:58well, find will return either true or false anyway, you don't need either to dispatch second time gltewalt 21:59according to help it doesn't 9214 21:59@gltewalt remember that everything is true except false or none 22:01anyway, in your case find always will return either true or false because vowels is a bitset! gltewalt 22:02 >> find vowels "cat" == false >> find vowels #"a" == true 9214 22:02well, how can you search for string! in a bitset!? 22:04 text >> if find "cat meow dog woof" "dog" [print "found!"] found! 22:04 text >> find "cat meow dog woof" "dog" == "dog woof" 22:07oh, wait, it actually works, my bad >> v: charset "cat" == make bitset! #{000000000000000000000000500008} >> find v "cat" == true gltewalt 22:08Now I'm frustrated. Just need a true or false if the first char in a string is a vowel 22:09 >> starts-with-vowel?: func [str][find to-string first str vowels] == func [str][find to-string first str vowels] >> starts-with-vowel? "ack" == "a" >> starts-with-vowel? "cat" == none 9214 22:09and why you're frustrated if it works? 22:09none is falsey gltewalt 22:10Thats why I added the either block 9214 22:10no, I meant that none is false 22:11> everything is true except false or none gltewalt 22:11But starts-with-vowel? "ack" returns "a", not true 9214 22:11gosh, "a" is true too! :D 22:11> **everything** is true **except** false or none gltewalt 22:12lol, ok but I wanted an explicit true or false. Is that bad? am I slow? 9214 22:12do you really want it? 22:12I mean, why? gltewalt 22:13Because of pigify. pigify: func [str][ either starts-with-vowel? str [append str "yay"][move-consonants str append str "ay"] ] 9214 22:14@gltewalt and what's bad with pigify? either will dispatch as expected on string! or any other true-ish value 22:15anyway, you can explicitly convert result of find with to logic! >> vowel?: func [c [char!]][find "aeiou" c] == func [c [char!]][find "aeiou" c] >> vowel-1st?: func [str][to logic! vowel? first str] == func [str][to logic! vowel? first str] >> vowel-1st? "cat" == false >> vowel-1st? "apple" == true gltewalt 22:15Yeah I guess it **does** work 22:16Sorry, I'm dense 9214 22:17nay, don't apologize for trying to learn something new gltewalt 22:24Now to move the stupid punctuation from wherever it falls afer being pigified to the end of the sentence (or word) 9214 22:25hi, should be ihay, and not i,hay? gltewalt 22:26Yeah. Some people choose to hyphenate, though 22:26i-hay 22:28close but no cigar... >> b: "!bear" == "!bear" >> move to-string pick b idx tail b == "" >> b == "!bear!" Tuesday 19th September, 2017 geekyi 22:26All this should probably be in red/help :smile: 22:26So everyone can see gltewalt 23:41I-hay, Wednesday 20th September, 2017 greggirwin 19:29@gltewalt, instead of using first on your string, you can use find/match. >> v: charset "aeiou" == make bitset! #{000000000000000000000000444104} >> find/match "cat" v == none >> find/match "alpaca" v == "lpaca" >> find/match at "cat" 2 v == "t" It may not always be as clear, from an intent standpoint, but that's a case-by-case call. 19:31Red hasn't included found? yet, and may not, but that's what Rebol used to coerce find results to logic. found?: func [ "Returns TRUE if value is not NONE." value ][ not none? :value ] 19:31You can also just use to logic! directly. Friday 22nd September, 2017 gltewalt 16:40@9214 Looks like a basic rotate is as simple as this. rotate: func [b [block!]][ move back tail b head b head b ] 16:45 rotate: func [b [block!] count [integer!]][ loop count [ move back tail b head b head b ] ] rebolek 16:49@gltewalt >> rotate: func [block offset][head move/part block (length? block) - offset offset] >> rotate [a b c d e f] 2 == [c d e f a b] gltewalt 16:52Nice. But I don't quite understand that one. - offset offset ? rebolek 16:54move/part takes three arguments, series, offset and length. So you can read it as move/part (block) ((length? block) - offset) (offset) gltewalt 16:57Blows up on my Red version >> rotate [a b c d e f] 2 *** Script Error: move does not allow integer! for its target argument *** Where: move *** Stack: rotate 16:59Red for Windows version 0.6.3 built 14-Sep-2017/13:15:36-06:00 rebolek 17:01@gltewalt Ah, sorry!

Nenad would have to say if, by design, it will be supported. 17:51If it works, you can do what you want, but I've never seen anyone do it. :^) I was surprised it work at first glance. rebolek 17:51It should work, /local is not different from other refinements 9214 17:57hm, optional leaking, that's interesting proposal rebolek 17:59Do not forget /local is nothing special: >> f: func [/local value][reduce [value]] == func [/local value][reduce [value]] >> f == [none] >> f/local 42 == [42] gltewalt 18:43Network went down.

Too many words and multiple uses of words could be considered clutter. And as for right now, Red leaks a lot 19:10I guess it's lexical clutter vs. cognitive load. Or something like that. 9214 19:11so you'd rather use either right [take/part blah blah blah blah blah][take/part blah blah blah blah blah blah blah]? gltewalt 19:12I don't know. I'm asking if there's a preferred community way. 9214 19:13it's a matter of taste I believe 19:26 text rotate: function [series offset /local src dst part][ ?: negative? offset shift: offset: absolute offset % len: length? series set [src dst part] reduce pick [ [series (tail series) shift] [(skip series len - shift) series offset] ] ? move/part src dst part head series ] >> rotate [1 2 3 4 5] 1 == [5 1 2 3 4] >> rotate [1 2 3 4 5] -1 == [2 3 4 5 1] >> rotate [1 2 3 4 5] 6 == [5 1 2 3 4] >> rotate [1 2 3 4 5] -6 == [2 3 4 5 1] greggirwin 19:31@toomasv, here's a very old R2 version of mine: rotate: func [ "Rotate values in a series." series [series!] /left "Rotate left (the default)" /right "Rotate right" /part range [number!] "Rotate this many positions" ; TBD series! support? ][ range: any [all [range range // length? series] 1] if any [empty? series zero? range] [return series] either right [ series: skip tail series negate range head insert head series take/part series range ][ append series take/part series range ] ] We are of one mind. gltewalt 19:35Oh I didn't know you could make a /left or /right and have it the default. I figured you had to type rotate/left or rotate/right, and that rotate by itself would blow up 9214 19:39@gltewalt less wordy version rotate: function [series offset][ ?: negative? offset shift: offset: absolute offset % len: length? series head do compose [ move/part ( pick [ [series (tail series) shift] [(skip series len - shift) series offset] ] ? ) series ] ] gltewalt 19:39It's obvious now. But this morn was my first refinement greggirwin 19:48It's all in how you structure the internal logic. I just supported /left, and do this other places too, so you can make your code more self-documenting. toomasv 19:52@greggirwin Indeed :), but you have your bag of tricks! greggirwin 19:54I love seeing all the different ways it can be done. And some things in my old bag still run! gltewalt 20:04Yeah lots of things to consider 20:05@9214 I guess I don't like "less wordy version" as much 9214 20:09¯\_(ツ)_/¯ greggirwin 20:10Now, if we support negative offsets, *and* direction refinements, is it too confusing, from an interface perspective? 9214 20:11in that case refinements are just syntactic sugar to self-document code greggirwin 20:11Have to think about what flexibility that might offer. My gut says to keep it simple. 9214 20:11I actually love an idea of "dummy" words greggirwin 20:13@9214, I was think about whether rotate/right -5 is useful. 20:13I've used dummy words in a number of dialects. 9214 20:18@greggirwin I meant something like that #local [ #macro [lit-word!] func [s e][] probe 'dear 'Red 'please reverse [1 2 3] 'thanks 'in 'advance ] 20:20if only I could use #macro `: :comment and `word syntax, but this will work only with `<some-series> 20:20jeez, how do I escape backticks here? 20:22done! 20:25@greggirwin and in your example refinement and offset sign could contradict each other, so something should take precedence 20:25or you can just absolute all offsets greggirwin 20:26Right, so I think it's best to have one or the other. 9214 20:26could be interesting to support series/< or series/>>N support for rotating 20:27though I doubt that it can be implemented as macro greggirwin 20:27I prefer refinements, but there may be an argument for negative offsets in some cases. e.g. a UI where a rotator lets a user select a start point by dragging. >> would be shifting, wouldn't it? 9214 20:27only at lexer level 20:28well, yeah, I don't know if there's any special sign for rotating greggirwin 20:29I don't think so. (>>)? 9214 20:30btw, no one told how clever I am when I showed this :( https://gist.github.com/9214/c325d349195ba9054e18555ed51c9ed5 20:31though inner parsing loop could be refactored a little 20:31to use change instead gltewalt 20:31Didn't you show that in the Red room? Not sure how many Lisp folks are in there. greggirwin 20:32I'm not a Lisp guy, so I think I needed to digest it a bit, and have been short of time lately. 20:32It is *very* clever though. gltewalt 20:34red/red room 20:35While I remember... this might be to your liking @9214 https://processing.org/ 9214 20:36:point_right: https://gitter.im/red/red?at=599ddfe4a7b406262dbd5e4c 20:36I know about processing, though it's more @honix's stuff 20:37actually I want to try [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/) some time 20:52I've updated gist, will post in /lisp room shortly gltewalt 21:41Can we call modules 'units'?

If we can find better use for word has (and I believe we can), than I vote for getting rid of it. I won’t miss it. Monday 2nd October, 2017 9214 16:05perhaps has should be auto-capturing version of does, the same way function is a "smarter" version of func? 16:06but then has is just an alias for context greggirwin 17:37The function "name space" covers things well IMO: func [] [] ; declare params and locals function [] [] ; declare params, automatic local capturing has [] [] ; declare locals, no params does [] ; no params, no locals Has states the intent well, as long as you know it's a function creator. I've never had confusion over this myself. Proc generally means there's no return value, rather than no params, so doesn't seem any better. In order to get both meanings, we probably need a longer name, which then makes us look at what we gain. gltewalt 17:47does-with greggirwin 17:57Not bad. gltewalt 23:03Which one of these is close to being right? closure1: does [func ['f][bind/copy f system/words]] closure2: does [func ['f][bind/copy body-of :f]] closure3: does [func ['f][bind/copy (body-of :f) system/words]] closure4: does [func ['f][bind/copy spec-of :f]] closure5: does [func ['f][bind/copy (spec-of :f) system/words]] Tuesday 3th October, 2017 gltewalt 02:35Grumble... greggirwin 06:40From Doc, some time back: closure: func [vars spec body][ ; Don't have to reuse 'spec name; just saves a word. bind (body-of spec: func spec body) (context vars) :spec ] Though "being right" means first you have to say what the desired behavior is. gltewalt 15:38In his example from red/red, I don't see how that can capture z: 1 as z is bound before closure is built 15:39z: 1 add2: closure [c] [[c + z]] 9214 15:41z is bound to it's current value (1) in current context (system/words), same for +, c is skipped because it's in spec block ([c]) gltewalt 15:44But I thought you wanted to "freeze" z, so that later z: 10 in global will have no effect 15:46Oh, and it looks like words-of isn't done yet. 9214 17:16@gltewalt re-read Nenad's messages - later we've figured out that this closure! implementation from R3 is broken 17:16so yeah, it should freeze z to 1, but it doesn't Friday 6th October, 2017 toomasv 11:06Little fun with game-of life: do https://tinyurl.com/y9mtqdqz Just select "Random" for initial state and click ">". Or draw your own initial state and go. ([Gist](https://gist.github.com/toomasv/5cdec157a412364cdd30347e05e572bc) and [repo](https://github.com/toomasv/game-of-life)) greggirwin 18:09Nice @toomasv. If I let it run to a stale state, Reset doesn't seem to do anything. If I drag the main canvas, it is loose. Thought I could drag to draw the pattern, rather than clicking. toomasv 18:20@greggirwin Thanks, Gregg, I'll try to improve this. Currently Reset only deletes history, so you can't navigate any more with + and -, and leaves the current state as new starting-point. To actually start over you have to choose Blank and then either click-in your new start-pattern or choose Random. 18:32Dragging and clicking--I'll meditate on this.

From what I was reading. geekyi 02:42@gltewalt > Is there a scheme out there somewhere that uses [ ] instead of ( ) ? I think the original lisp was like that.. Also, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_(programming_language) 02:43Dylan is the lisp which has the word ordering closest to a Rebol I've found 02:45Wow, I've never heard of http://exercism.io/languages/lfe/about 02:45> Lisp Flavoured Erlang (AKA LFE) is a lisp syntax front-end to the Erlang compiler.

It's now JS, too, because...well. :^\ 19:09On langs, Logo is the first square bracket lang I think of. gltewalt 19:19JS is 'kind' of like a redbol cousin. But it gets annoying pretty quickly 19:27Wow, looking at logo examples - you can really see the Logo in Rebol greggirwin 19:30@gltewalt, yep. For fun, look up the Brian Harvey series 'Computer Science Logo Style'. 9214 22:12ah, Redbol job, one could only dream 22:22@gltewalt [] speaking of - Factor them too have, wording weird some with also, Yoda's language programming choice it is Forth with together. gltewalt 23:15Kind of made sense it did when it I looked at Friday 13th October, 2017 geekyi 04:09[ quotes ] Factor in, somewhat like Rebol [ blocks ] and ' lit-word or quote word 04:10Rather, rebol has a lot of different mechanisms for that. Different way of thinking in syntax I guess.. 04:12Lots of higher order functions, stuff like [bi](https://docs.factorcode.org/content/word-bi%2Ckernel.html) that even lisp doesn't have (applies to most concatenative languages). Only [j](http://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/NuVoc) is better 04:16[![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/red/sandbox/FTs3/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/red/sandbox/FTs3/image.png) 04:19^- higher order functions are called conjunctions in j 04:20Actually, those are functions that take in functions as arguments and output functions 04:24Such types of functions are rare, you can only see them in concatenative and fp style languages, and things like mathematica 04:27A typical example of such a function is differentiation, which you can see in the picture above about Conjunctions 04:28Which is different from functions which are [data func] -> [data], like fold in haskell 04:31fold in j is / for example. Such classes of functions are called Adverbs, because they act on Verbs, which themselves is the terminology for functions in j (not a bad terminology might I add, with Noun for data) 04:32So, the function abstraction hierarchy is like that: Noun -> Verb -> Adverb -> Conjunction 04:341. Most programming languages are *Noun* focused languages, using *Verbs* at times. This is the mainstream object oriented languages 2. Functional languages focus on *Verbs* which act on *Nouns*, often using *Adverbs* 3. Function-level languages focus on composition, using *Adverbs* and *Conjunctions* 04:36 04:40When it comes to that level of abstraction tho, I feel it's still a bit immature. Mostly people do variations of compose. Only few have more useful stuff like *differentiation*, *function inverses*, etc.. built in 04:44Rebol is better than almost everything else at the syntax level (also with most types of data), but I feel it lacking at the type level (still, better than most which don't have types) 04:46I meant to write about HOF, but wanted to built a better picture of where it could fit in with the rest and didn't know where to get started. Well at least this is out there now :smile: 04:47Other stuff: Dependent types, categories 04:48[2-categories](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/2-category) 04:48> The notion of a 2-category generalizes that of category: a 2-category is a higher category, where on top of the objects and morphisms, there are also 2-morphisms 04:49Should I put this in the wiki? gltewalt 04:54Still don't have traditional closure and HOF in Red. So far. Stuff too far beyond that spooks me 04:56I know the gist of lisp / scheme, and I'm aware of ML-like pattern matching, but that's as far as it goes 9214 05:24I'd really like to see user-defined datatypes in Red gltewalt 06:22Then maybe you should choose R/S for your low level thing 06:25So... if R/S is written in Red, how come he didn't just go with low level access in Red. Similar to inline ASM in the middle of a C program 9214 06:46@gltewalt Red is written in R/S and Rebol (for now), not the other way around 06:47and you can inline R/S with routines 06:49now J is also on my list gltewalt 10:57""" at some point, when the bootstrapping phase will be over, Red/System will be rewritten entirely in Red, giving an opportunity to fix and improve the design (also helped by several months of feedback from Red/System usage).

Saturday 14th October, 2017 geekyi 04:21When you don't know where you clicked to get the link from: 04:21https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgs0F70c-I4 04:24This is much more interesting :smile: Data structure visualization: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwZmAgAuIkY 9214 06:40@geekyi have you used J for large tabular-like data processing? With my recent fiasco with csv parsing I'm looking for good data-oriented alternatives :smile: 06:41and I'm interested in array-based languages in particular 07:53and how J is different from K? gltewalt 07:58It's one earlier 9214 10:39Perhaps this isn't the right place to ask such questions, but this is a nice community of (mostly) reasonable people and I'm curious to hear your thoughts, so I'll proceed anyway. My current day-to-day activity involves some programming-related tasks, mostly data crunching and parsing. This tasks are rather trivial when formulated, i.e. "you have this table, calculate X for each row and then do Y and Z" or "just get X from text files and put them in Y". But, they usually are time constrained, i.e. I should do it *right now* or *ASAP* - and this constrains make me very uneasy, to the degree that I experience panic attack and feel like :shit: while staring and the screen for hours; apathy and passive-aggressive behavior emerges and I need either to take a nap or really long break to reset and feel like good version of myself again. Another thing that makes me feel this way is the fact that sometimes such tasks require usage of terminology/methods/tooling with which I'm not familiar with and can't just get on a first pass. In other words, *I can't feel comfortable and do this tasks until I make sense out of it fully*, and I can't make sense out of it until I cram free time for self-studying at home, which I can't do on a daily basis because the only free time I have is between 10PM and and 9AM or on weekends. **TL;DR**: when I have task at my hands which is either time constrained, or involves some unfamiliar methods/terminology/whatever, or both, I feel completely let down because: constrains make me unease, I can't proceed until I understand problem, data and domain "globally". **On contrary**, when it comes to more *investigative/exploratory* and *analytical* tasks (e.g. "we have no :boom: idea what's going on, just fix this at your own pace and report back when you done" or "this doesn't make sense, can you make sense out of it and tell us what you think?" or "boy do you ever wondered how this thing works?"), which don't have strict time constrains and give me freedom to perform whichever way is suitable, I feel like at home and can do this stuff with pleasure. I feel even more comfortable if task is "conceptual", i.e. if it's some well-defined problem domain in which I just need to dive deep, on my own, and for a long time, or if it's some terra incognita and *everyone (except me :smile: ) would feel uneasy if they'd be asked to go there and do something*. So, **the questions is**: am I just some sissy or this is a valid personal (or maybe not personal but "stylistic" or whatever) problem which I should discuss with my "superiors"? I know my shortcomings and I know that I shouldn't push myself, otherwise both people and myself would get hurt. What would you suggest as an engineer and/or like-minded person? 10:51And **the best** tasks is the ones described above, but which I choose by myself instead of receiving from someone. 12:24and my god J is really nice so far gltewalt 18:16Most humans react poorly to "figure this out and do it now", or, "we don't know what's going on, but sort this out right now". 18:18This business or office culture is probably the number one reason that MS Excel was invented 18:19Grab a copy of that, get familiar with formulas and macros, and you won't need languages. Can import CSV directly into excel. Sounds like they should be using some database, but are not 18:31I'm suspicious of forall. For each is more accurate 'visitor pattern'.

(+/%#) *is itself a dyad*! mah boi 19:20but how comes that it acts like a dyad if it writes like a monad..? gltewalt 19:58"The symbol / is called "Insert", because in effect it inserts whatever function is on its left between each item of the list on its right.

Analysis Paralysis is a real thing, and I know *I* feel like I need to understand something completely, before trusting I can do it right, and well. Just because I *can* make something work correctly, doesn't mean I'm satisfied that the solution is the right one, or will last, be robust, etc. So there is anxiety when others say "it's fine" and let it go, because it seems to work OK at first. You sound perfectly normal to me. :^) 21:34I haven't seen a fuzzer, but I want to build a system/tool/site that lets us generate "tests" asks for input like a CAPTCHA, and compares results with what is eval'd. This can not only uncover bugs, but design expectations. gltewalt 21:36How can we translate R3's delta-profile to Red? Do we have to wait until stats is further developed? geekyi 22:43I think @greggirwin's (and another, don't remember who now) updated timing functions are better 22:44Timing with runs 22:45Maybe invert it completely so you get something like runs/second 22:45Altho, delta-profile looks really nice 23:19@9214 > @geekyi have you used J for large tabular-like data processing? With my recent fiasco with csv parsing I'm looking for good data-oriented alternatives :smile: J I usually use for quick calculations and plotting. It helps because less key strokes, fast startup, nice ui for reusing calculations, etc. Not so good with it in parsing data. Either I don't know or it is hard. I usually use something else (r is nice, also an array processing language and has a built-in library for parsing csv, but larger compared to redbol and j) Often use redbol when I have to parse something (so much easier to understand and less buggy compared to regex!) K is from a different person (tho I think there was history there, not sure) I don't like it's syntax (J is cleaner for me) And K's creator seem to invent another language every few years (Kx, Q, etc), but it could potential be better, I haven't really tried it gltewalt 23:27https://imgur.com/a/rvYQg Sunday 15th October, 2017 geekyi 00:07@gltewalt source? gltewalt 00:31Glassdoor 00:32https://www.atronixengineering.com/careers/#967195410 9214 05:18oh, I hacked Siemens PLCs and pentested SCADA during my bachelor's degree graduation project (or whatever it's called) 05:18interesting stuff 05:26@geekyi yeah, I thought about R too, but Python seems like a more reasonable alternative (I *hate* python, but as a tool for getting work done it's ok, and it's modern lingua franca anyway) geekyi 05:27@9214 whatever works! :smile: 9214 05:27@geekyi thanks for insights! any tips regarding hooks and forks though? geekyi 05:28R is nice, once you get past the weird syntax I guess.. lots of docs and libraries 05:28@9214 I thought you figured it out? 05:28:point_up: [October 15, 2017 1:03 AM](https://gitter.im/red/sandbox?at=59e26da4e44c43700a32c635) > "There are four basic schemes for trains of verbs" 05:29That's it basically 9214 05:29@geekyi I figured out that they're sort of a idiomatic shortcuts, I know how I can use them, I don't get *why* they are formed the way they are formed geekyi 05:29The idea is any binary function (dyad, taking 2 arguments) can be composed 05:30That you can break down any multi argument function into dyads.. 05:30The monad / dyad dichotomy in J complicates everything I feel 9214 05:31why I write (f g h) y and it acts like (f y) g (h y)? 05:31yeah, I guess it's a shortcoming of sticking with limited ascii characters set 05:31intuitively I want to write y (f g h) y 05:32that way it looks like a dyad and acts like a dyad and everyones happy :smile: 05:33I just need some theory behind this kind of function composition and application geekyi 05:34Some are adverbs which act on verbs 9214 05:35I know that, but in this case we have monad-dyad-monad combo geekyi 05:36Monadic fork 05:36Does the diagrams in http://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Vocabulary/fork ? 9214 05:39are they just "syntactic sugar" and "you see this - you rewrite it like that" **or** there're some theory behind such transformations? geekyi 05:39 (f g h) y = (f y) g (h y) monadic fork y noun f h monadic verb g dyadic (ad)verb 9214 05:40I don't understand how monadic f and g could apply to the same argument at the same time if J have strict right to left evaluation order geekyi 05:41@9214 yeah, it's "syntactic sugar" for composition of verbs, only in () 05:41A lot of people do think it's a bit clunky.. 9214 05:42welp, now I'm satisfied :+1: geekyi 05:43So if you don't have it inside (f g h), e.g. f g h definitely behaves differently 05:43I may be wrong, but that's how I've thought of it.. 9214 05:44yes, they produce different binary trees of function composition/application 06:00@geekyi * *noun* is an array of any rank; * *verb* is a function that acts on *nouns* and produces *nouns*, it's either *monadic* or *dyadic*, or both; * *adverb* is a function that acts on *verbs* and produces new *verbs*, *adverb* is a *monad* that receives only leftmost argument; * *conjunction* is a function that acts on *verbs* and produces new *verbs*, it's a *dyad*. am I a good student or this is all (or in some parts) plain wrong? geekyi 06:03@9214 In general, all *verbs* are both dyadic and monadic.

Monday 23th October, 2017 toomasv 15:57Some steps to [cryptarithm](https://gist.github.com/toomasv/c63e49e26d2cfb6032db9d0428029e3d) solving: >> do %cryptarithm.red >> solve/heuristics [SEND + MORE = MONEY][[M S] = [1 9]] == [9567 + 1085 = 10652] >> solve/heuristics [CLOCK + TICK + TOCK = PLANET][P = 1 T <> [0 4] C >= 2] == [90593 + 9693 + 9593 = 109879] >> solve/heuristics [YES + LETS + ALL + TRY + A + FUNNY = TEASER][T = 1 [Y L A F] > 0]; may take long == [206 + 5016 + 355 + 142 + 3 + 97882 = 103604] gltewalt 16:20That's neat. I can't believe I hadn't heard of it before now. toomasv 17:10@gltewalt :open_mouth: Check the links in the end of my file. greggirwin 18:23Really nice @toomasv. I like that you've made this accessible to people who might not know Red, while still including some things they have to understand, to get the details. toomasv 19:46@greggirwin Thanks! Cleaned and updated it, added * and / ops. Can you give me advice how to keep letters from leaking into global context. I tried declaring them in context but they are still leaking. gltewalt 19:54Is it the words in solve? greggirwin 20:25@toomasv, you'll have to jump through a hoop or two. We can't yet extend contexts, except the global one, so you'll need to hide your words in an object you create dynamically (because you don't know what they'll be). Set, by default, sets words in the global context. You can use self, if you know the words, but that will limit you in this case. A is hidden here, but you have to know what it will be. >> o: object [a: none go: func [val][set in self 'a val]] == make object! [ a: none go: func [val][set in self 'a val] ] >> o/go 1 == 1 >> probe o make object! [ a: 1 go: func [val][set in self 'a val] ] What you need to do is use inner objects for all the leaking word blocks you use set on. Maybe something like this: obj-from-words: function [words [block!]][ object append collect [ foreach word words [keep to set-word! word] ] none ] heur-obj: object [ heur: none set-heur: func [spec [block!] "keys+vals" /local key val][ heur: obj-from-words extract spec 2 foreach [key val] spec [set in heur key val] heur ] ] heur-obj/set-heur [a 1 b 2 c 3] probe heur-obj toomasv 20:27@gltewalt Yes, there are words in solve block. These are transformed into strings and every letter in string is made into word! in block ltrs and transformed into calculable formula (see calculation). Letters in this block are then appended to another block letters, made unique and later random values are attached to them until the calculation returns true. 20:29@greggirwin Thanks, I'll study this. 20:37@greggirwin But the following works too: >> cx: context [ a: b: none letters: [a b] set 'fun func [vals][set letters vals] ] == make object! [ a: none b: none letters: [a b] ] >> fun [1 2] == [1 2] >> a *** Script Error: a has no value *** Where: catch *** Stack: >> b *** Script Error: b has no value *** Where: catch *** Stack: >> cx/a == 1 >> cx/b == 2 I don't understand why it doesn't work in my cryptarithm code. greggirwin 21:22Because, in the above, letters is defined *inside* the context. Hence, that's where the words are bound. Tuesday 24th October, 2017 toomasv 07:43@greggirwin True, and in my script I commented them out only because it didn't work. But now I solved the problem in [cryptarithm](https://gist.github.com/toomasv/c63e49e26d2cfb6032db9d0428029e3d) by bind (lines [30](https://gist.github.com/toomasv/c63e49e26d2cfb6032db9d0428029e3d#file-cryptarithm-red-L30) and [50](https://gist.github.com/toomasv/c63e49e26d2cfb6032db9d0428029e3d#file-cryptarithm-red-L50)). Thanks for your help! greggirwin 16:30Looks like the letters also need to be singles, from your defs at the top of the context for those words. Good solution. gltewalt 20:45@greggirwin ever thought about creating a local (or regional) meetup group for redbol? Wednesday 25th October, 2017 greggirwin 02:32Nope. It would be just you and me, and I don't have time to push and organize something else. 02:36My time lately has been consumed by a show. I'm doing The Addams Family at Boise Little Theatre, if you have nothing else going on this weekend. We play Th/Fr/Sa. gltewalt 02:51You think we are the only folks around here that dabble in redbol? Yeah 02:52I don't know where the "yeah" came from. Crazy phone greggirwin 05:15:^) People are always nice when I talk about it, and I will push more once we get a few other things in place. toomasv 12:01Added [alphametic](http://www.cadaeic.net/alphas.htm) function to [cryptarithm](https://gist.github.com/toomasv/c63e49e26d2cfb6032db9d0428029e3d): >> alphametic/heuristics "Who is this idiot?"

I haven't went back to learn it because there's so much to learn with just Red, and parse, and bind and context fiddling 20:45And View/Vid 20:46It's actually like learning 3 languages before you even get to Red/System 9214 20:47how would you determine what's composeable and what is not? gltewalt 20:48Same as blocks with ( ) 20:48The word compose would have to be present or your strings with parens would just be normal strings 9214 20:48and what if I don't want () to be composed? gltewalt 20:49Don't use the word compose 9214 20:49uhm 20:50to rephrase, what if I want to compose one () but not the other? gltewalt 20:50Ah 9214 20:50what's the escaping mechanism? gltewalt 20:51Well I thought () would be enough, but I guess not 20:54How can you compose one () in block, not not any further () ? 9214 20:54 text parse s: "1 + 2 = (1 + 2)" [ some [ to change copy match ["(" some [not ["(" | ")"] skip] ")"] (do load match) | end ] ] probe s 20:55 text >> compose [(quote (no don't touch me))] == [(no don't touch me)] Friday 27th October, 2017 toomasv 04:14Gregg has it this way: >> composite "1 + 2 = :(1 + 2): (<- this is evaluated)" == "1 + 2 = 3 (<- this is evaluated)" 9214 04:20and why not to allow user to specify this patterns himself? gltewalt 06:02R3 has reword.

It involves doing millions of hashing operations, and I wasn't sure how to manage the memory for it 9214 09:24@toomasv yes, precisely 09:39@dander the general advice is to allocate series with make and to reuse already existing series with /into refinements toomasv 09:43@9214 Little changes to @greggirwin 's code: composite-ctx: context [ eval: func [ "Evaluate expr and return the result" expr [string!] "Valid Red, as a string expression" err-val "If not none, return this instead of formed error information, if eval fails" /local res ][ either error? set/any 'res try [do expr][ any [err-val form reduce [" *** Error:" res/id "Where:" expr "*** "]] ][ either unset? get/any 'res [""][:res] ] ] ; One of the big questions is what to do if there are mismatched expr ; markers.

Did day 3 . Chasing the E.Bunny! dander 17:03@9214 I was doing some of that, but some parts are harder than others. The particular case involved concatenating a string with an integer, hashing it, and checking the output. I got so far as reusing the input and output strings (and that seemed to work), but it was still allocating memory where I was joining the sample string to the int. I think it was maybe converting the int to a string, and needs to allocate a new string for that. I could have done something where I calculated out the text representation of the int and manually inserted it into the input string, but I felt like it was starting to be not-fun by that point. I dunno, maybe there was another way of doing it that I didn't think of, but the whole thing will be moot once GC arrives anyway 17:10@toomasv nice :) greggirwin 19:22We can certainly extend composite to allow custom markers. I would probably call the refinement /with as that's a standard name for default overrides. 9214 20:05:( :( 20:06this marker is depressed because he knows that he'll be wiped out soon gltewalt 21:25what are these for? compose*: 21:25Significance of *? 9214 21:25@gltewalt in codebase * is used for names that alias with high-level definitions 21:28or for low-level definitions that aren't supposed to be used directly gltewalt 22:41 >> compose-string "(person) had a (size) (animal).

Day 5 was tough! Forced my machine to knees (or rather Red? Lot of silent shutdowns). dander 20:34@toomasv too tough for me. Did you figure out how to manage the memory? Or save some state and resume it? toomasv 20:38@dander I saved succeeding numbers, and on next try after shutdown continued frome these. dander 20:40that makes sense. Do you think it was just related to memory use? toomasv 20:47@dander I am pretty sure it is: >> st: stats loop 100000 [checksum rejoin ["aagrtuei" 1] 'MD5] stats - st == 20086784 dander 20:49I was doing something like that, and tried switching from rejoin to append to reuse the output string, but it seemed like there was still an allocation to convert 1 to "1" 20:50I didn't really think of saving the intermediate result toomasv 21:01Well, considered limitations of memory, it seemed the only way to get further.

Monday 30th October, 2017 9214 17:20@geekyi http://t3x.org/klong-stat/index.html well, I was onto something when started with J ;) gltewalt 19:28So the fact that poke can only do one value at a time seems like a problem to me 19:29And why if it says "any-value" does it give a invalid value error if a char isn't used ? greggirwin 19:34@gltewalt, why is that a problem? It's poking one value into the place of another. gltewalt 20:26Inevitably a user will want to poke in multiple values in place of an old one - whether they actually need to or not. 20:28A 'newer' user 9214 20:29 text >> blk: [1 2 3] == [1 2 3] >> also blk poke blk 2 [2 2 2] == [1 [2 2 2] 3] 20:30do you expect [1 2 2 2 3] here? gltewalt 20:30Yep 9214 20:30but it's not the value (block), it's content of the value gltewalt 20:31It will come up with strings more often, because people coming to redbol are usually coming from a string-centric world 9214 20:32I don't really like that attitude with "oh they coming from X we should do anything to please them" gltewalt 20:33Not really 'do anything'. But they're going to see that there isn't a built in easy way to do it. 20:34The flip side of trying to cater to newbie expectations, is the old guard who know longer think like the newbies 9214 20:36although I can see that your point is valid, without poke I would go with change/part and it's too hairy for such simple task at hand greggirwin 20:48> Inevitably a user will want to poke in multiple values in place of an old one - whether they actually need to or not. People will want to do a lot of things. If they try something, and it doesn't work, the question is whether there's another way, or if a common need is made unreasonably difficult. If the answer is "Use this other function, and here's why...", and the benefit is a language that's more consistent and easy to reason about, I'm OK with that. 20:49I do love when I try something and it just works. But if it doesn't, and there's a good reason, I try to look beyond my immediate reaction that it's poor design. 9214 20:50@greggirwin how would you go with changing b in abc to, say, bb? greggirwin 20:50That said, if you want the change, make a proposal. Provide examples of how the behavior will do all you want, without unintended consequences. 20:50@9214, change/part as you suggested. 20:52@gltewalt, in this case, think about what poke does. e.g., does it change the length of a series? No. It replaces one single value with another single value. What kind of values does a string series refer to? Hence... 9214 20:52 text >> do also 's change/part at s: "abc" 2 "bb" 1 == "abbc" versus >> do also 's poke s: "abc" 2 "bb" 20:53yes, with your proposal string should automatically expand somehow or be reconstructed from scratch gltewalt 21:07I should just stay away from this thing when I'm mobile. Now I can't even edit my typo. dander 21:08Does it seem like change and replace have somewhat overlapping scopes? I'm not trying to imply that is bad, but I'm having some trouble figuring out their individual purposes. Is it just that replace implies a search pattern? gltewalt 21:09It doesn't have to be poke, but one of change, replace, poke should probably make it straightforward. 9214 21:10@gltewalt even more straightforward? >> replace "abc" "b" "bb" == "abbc" gltewalt 21:11and "abcdabc"? 21:11If you want to replace index 6? 9214 21:11 text >> replace at x: "abcbd" 4 "b" "bb" == "bbd" >> x == "abcbbd" greggirwin 21:12@dander, replace has a difference meaning, because you're replacing by content, not position. It also has refinements that support that intent, which wouldn't apply in an index-based function like change. gltewalt 21:12And if you want the last occurrence of "b" without having to know parse? greggirwin 21:13@gltewalt find/last 9214 21:13@gltewalt are there any bits of parse in my examples? gltewalt 21:14No, but help implies parse 9214 21:15in what place? ARGUMENTS: series [series!] "The series to be modified". pattern "Specific value or parse rule pattern to match". value "New value, replaces pattern in the series". greggirwin 21:15@gltewalt, I don't know how it could be any more straight-forward but, as you noted, old timers can't see with fresh eyes. What we need are *concrete* examples of how *specific* changes in proposals make things better. In some cases, you'll get consensus without that, but if there's pushback, you need to defend your position. gltewalt 21:15"Specific value or parse rule pattern to match". 9214 21:16@gltewalt "Specific value **or** parse rule pattern to match" gltewalt 21:16find/last isn't a value to new eyes 9214 21:16there's a "specific value" part on the left side btw ;) 21:17and what is it, some fancy stuff for old farts like us? :older_man: gltewalt 21:17Also, am I missing something with find/reverse, or does it just not work? greggirwin 21:18OK, I'm missing something now. @gltewalt said: > And if you want the last occurrence of "b" without having to know parse? But you don't like find/last. How would *you* do it? Or, how do other langs do it, that is demonstrably better? 21:18Find/reverse should work. Do you have an example? 9214 21:19 text >> x: skip "babccbab" 6 == "ab" >> head x == "babccbab" >> x == "ab" >> find/reverse x "c" == "cbab" gltewalt 21:21it works - i just misread it greggirwin 21:23@gltewalt, here's a suggestion. Use the Red/Help room more than this room. Others likely have the same questions, and more people will benefit. You'll also get more eyes on your questions. 9214 21:24don't hesistate to be a young opposition, grey roots should be weeded out! :older_man: greggirwin 21:24@9214, do you mean me? 9214 21:25...and grey sprouts :baby: gltewalt 21:26@greggirwin it isn't about find/last, it's more about the help text.

I make joke! 9214 16:07can someone share resources or insights on data-driven programming in Redbol? 16:09I'm thinking of organizing all essential data of my program as a bunch of tables (well, blocks), and then, using dialects, explaining transformations of that data either in plain English or in notation suitable for the data at hand 16:12or data itself could be the description (i.e. code) that could be fed into dialect toomasv 16:53@9214 Hmmm, how about parse? 9214 16:55@toomasv :eyes: 16:55do I look like a :baby: for you? 16:57I meant that I'm not sure how I should organize all of this (in terms of modularity and code layout) and what should I take into account before starting? toomasv 17:00@greggirwin Some tasks are quite challenging, so it'll definitely be fun. @9214 No, more like :man:, and sometimes like :neckbeard:, or even :japanese_goblin: Sorry, these are all too abstract questions for me. "Starting" what? 9214 17:02When it comes to designing a dialect or going with data-driven approach that I described above, what are the "best practices" and what questions should programmer ask himself on planning and designing phases? What to consider, what to double check, etc. toomasv 17:06I'll come to your side of the question and will wait for someone to explain these things. 9214 17:07welp, now there're two of us :two_men_holding_hands: toomasv 17:09Yep :question: :eyes: 9214 17:25@greggirwin excuse me sir, do you want to talk about Dialects? :man: :book: 19:39First question - when should one make a compiler or an interpreter for his dialect? Suppose I have something like add one and one which means 1 + 1 in plain Red. How to decide if I should evaluate it each time as it is (interpret) or to translate once into "low level" representation (compile), in our case 1 + 1, and process that representation instead? rebolek 19:40That depends on your use case. 9214 19:41@rebolek it depends could be an answer to anything ;) rebolek 19:41@9214 Right, it actually **is** answer to anything. 19:41But, writing interpreter is easier, I would say. 9214 19:42in my case I want to describe some spec in plain English, but can't decide if I should compile it to something more easy processable (with simple do) or interpret each time with parse, I'd go with "preprocess once and do later". 19:43but then I should write something like my-spec: preprocess [...] instead of just my-spec: [...] rebolek 19:43Hm, in that case I agree that compiling is better approach. 9214 19:44And how can I make this preprocess function run only once? 19:44because, IIRC, on function call all other functions in its body will be evaluated rebolek 19:45Because translating the specs into actual code sounds much more useful than "just" interpreting them. 9214 19:46okay, question about "run once" was rather stupid, I think I can figure this out :D 19:47now it boils down to readable description which should be preprocessed into Red code before script starts to run, and that's what macros do, right? 19:48but since current compiler macros relies on R2, it's quite limited, and I don't want use it, so, what should I do in that case? rebolek 19:48Use interpreter macros? 9214 19:49@rebolek I tried, didn't worked 19:49or maybe I haven't tried enough :) rebolek 19:50Hm. Then probably you need to write your own preprocessor. But you need to preprocess only your own dialect, right? 9214 19:50@rebolek yup 19:50but it feels like overengineering for one script rebolek 19:50So it's basically just a dialect that will process your own rules and will spit out Red code. 9214 19:52@rebolek okay, thanks! And when it's more suitable to go with an interpreter? rebolek 19:55deleted ;) 9214 19:55noted ;) rebolek 19:58Well, I wrote interpeter for Lest (my templating engine), where the Lest source is actually "compiled" to HTML, but before it, it is interpreted using parse, not compiled to Red first and then to HTML. It makes sense for such immediate code, I guess. 19:59Actually, there is no hard border. If you look closely, what is interpreted and what is compiled gets very blurry, when we are not compiling to machine code but to other language in real time. 20:00Interpreting Lest works by rewriting original source, so it’s actually partially compiled. Or see math dialect for example. 9214 20:01I see, interesting rebolek 20:02Is math interpreted or compiled? 9214 20:05I don't get why op is here if it's never used? math: func [ {Evaluates a block using math precedence rules, returning the last result} body [block!] "Block to evaluate" /safe "Returns NONE on error" /local rule pos op sub end ][ parse body: copy/deep body rule: [ any [ pos: ['* (op: 'multiply) | quote / (op: 'divide)] [ahead sub: paren! (sub/1: math as block! sub/1) | skip] ( end: skip pos: back pos 3 pos: change/only/part pos as paren! copy/part pos end end ) :pos | into rule | skip ] ] either safe [attempt body] [do body] ] rebolek 20:07@9214 good catch! I guess it is some leftover from older code. It runs fine without it. 9214 20:08and dialect itself seems unfinished, what about other math operators and their function equivalents? rebolek 20:10Yes, it definitely is unfinished. It is good for some basic examples only, but that's not the point, I selected it as an example, because it is built in Red. The question is, if it's interpreter or compiler. 20:10I guess we should ask whoever wrote it if it will be updated, or if it’s abandoned. 9214 20:11parse part looks like a compiler, do part is an interpreter rebolek 20:11Yes, that's my interpretation too. 20:12And you can certainly write a dialect that will work vice-versa. 20:13That will interpreted some parts to compile the result afterwards. 20:14So with such dynamic language, it’s hard to split it into two categories. That’s what I think. 20:15Other people may see it differently I believe. 9214 20:17I guess interpreter is needed when there're some parts that can be "deduced" only at run time 20:20I mean, interpreter is the one that does the job in one language and spits out the result in the same language, and compiler is the one that translates from one language to another, right? rebolek 20:22Yes, I guess so. 9214 20:23who needs the dragon book when you have red/sandbox? :dragon: rebolek 20:41:) Wednesday 1st November, 2017 greggirwin 00:30I was most surprised, early in my Rebol career, when I wrote a few different versions of an FSM dialect. It got progressively less compile oriented, until it was all interpreted. I loved that result and it led me to accept that, because it's less work and less code to go wrong. 9214 00:33@greggirwin can you share different versions of this dialect? 00:34and what are advantages and disadvantages of compiled and interpreted dialects in your experience? 00:35or, as with code and data, there's no strict line between compiling and interpreting, just like @rebolek said? 00:39in my case it's not like I have well-defined problem domain, but rather a few chunks of data and description of its transformations, and I'd want to express all of this so that other people not familiar with Red or programming at all can read it and at least get the main gist greggirwin 03:04@9214, I have the old stuff here, but will need time to organize and explain. Basically, I started with a simple func that took a block of states and events, permuted those, and generated a State Transition Table used to build a skeleton FSM object/context, which looked a lot like one you might write by hand. Eventually I removed the object and code generation part entirely, dispatching directly from the STT (as data). 03:11The dialect, e.g., for a turnstile FSM, looks like this: sm: fsm/make-state-machine/with-stubs/trace 'locked [ when locked coin causes [unlock thank-you] then unlocked pass causes alarm when unlocked coin causes thank-you pass causes lock then locked other causes other-event when testing coin causes coin-test pass causes pass-test when repairing coin ignore pass ignore when error other causes reset then locked otherwise reset then locked repair then repairing test then testing XXX causes exception then error YYY causes exception then error other causes cant-handle-it then dead ] ; Test runner foreach event [coin pass xxx yyy repair test coin pass reset pass coin pass] [ print rejoin [sm/state tab event] sm/send event print rejoin [tab sm/state] ] /with-stubs generates placeholder funcs for the actions it finds. 03:12I also added standard enter/leave events for states, which auto-triggered. 03:13I should probably dust it off. :^) dander 06:55@toomasv I've been really busy with family things and trying to have enough sleep, and I haven't made any more progress over the past several days. I currently have a solution for day 7 part one which satisfies the samples, but not the test input. So now I am feeling somewhat motivated to experiment with some parse debugging ideas... 9214 09:51@greggirwin I also had something in mind for FSM dialect, either visual-based (you know, drawing and viewing FSM diagrams) or the one that compiles down to Verilog code (similar to [this](https://github.com/sam-falvo/SMG) project)... or both greggirwin 17:15I thought about a graphical approach as well, but haven't ever needed it. Higher on my list is a railroad diagram generator in Red, for parse rules. 17:15Generating other code is easy with Redbol. I've done a lot of that. iMatix was always inspirational in this regard as well. 9214 18:02Is there more general name for all of the stuff in [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Data) list? Data manipulation/processing? greggirwin 18:09I just get a template page. 9214 18:10@greggirwin is there some kind of a table? greggirwin 18:10Nope. 9214 18:10[![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/red/sandbox/mbcP/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/red/sandbox/mbcP/image.png) 18:10welp greggirwin 18:11Ah, I get it now. Wasn't reading the fine print. 18:13"Data Management and Processing" I imagine. That list covers a lot of ground. 9214 18:14@greggirwin :+1: thanks! gltewalt 20:18$166 for "the dragon book"? Yikes. greggirwin 20:31I have a copy here if you want to borrow it @gltewalt. gltewalt 21:31Maybe I could. Makes me feel a little weird "borrowing" though greggirwin 22:47Yeah, who would do that? Thursday 2nd November, 2017 9214 09:21@gltewalt SICP is more helpful for starters (speaking from my experience though) Friday 3th November, 2017 gltewalt 22:10Think I'll start Monday morning on a rouge lexer 9214 22:13@gltewalt they're using some hairy DSL with state machine and regexes all over the place, are you confident enough? gltewalt 22:14Not totally, but I'll try. 22:15I can swipe needed refers from toomas :tongue: 22:15Needed regex 22:18Preliminary question though: should break predefined words up into categories or just make one big builtins block that contains all of Reds predefined words? 9214 22:27builtins dander 23:26@gltewalt are you thinking about generating the list from Red itself? That might be nice because updating it for newer Red versions would just involve re-running the script. Starting with a builtins list seems easiest, and later if it is desirable, it could be broken into categories based on type or something Saturday 4th November, 2017 gltewalt 00:37I think I might try to copy the pygments lexer - though they have words broken down into categories. I'm not familiar at all with Python style regex stuff though 00:38Here's my quick start on Rouge. I probably wont be able to focus on it til monday morning though 00:38https://gist.github.com/gltewalt/9afccdb9c450395ff69fb8dab6bcc8f2 00:39@dander I grabbed the words from Red itself, yeah Sunday 5th November, 2017 gltewalt 00:05Grumble :angry: https://imgur.com/a/9OPDc 00:10Looks like I'll have to get the cudgel out and "port" the pygments file 9214 01:56nice twitter gltewalt 02:25VSCode is playing hell with formatting.

Do you mean theoretically in general, or in some more specific case? 9214 06:31Well, I know that it depends on use-case, I just not sure on which criteria to base my decisions. 06:42@9214 I'm* greggirwin 17:02I think it's very personal, and depends on the scenario. I have done a lot of both, but don't have any hard and fast rules. Tuesday 7th November, 2017 gltewalt 00:20Did it the bone-headed way, and it's still missing a few rules, but: https://i.imgur.com/cOJx2hU.jpg dander 03:38@gltewalt looks pretty nice for that sample gltewalt 04:05Needs cleaned up. Consolidate a few things. Missing a few rules. 04:08Also, I need two good demos. A short one like the FizzBuzz sample, and a long one that uses as much of the language as possible. 04:09I avoided most of the DSL stuff. Went with simple. 07:22@toomasv Tried to use some of your patterns from your ACE contribution, but half the time the patterns need to be modified for Ruby. Which... is not a good time for me, as I dislike regex and have tried to avoid it. I found this, which helps, but still not fun for me. http://rubular.com/ 07:23Might be fun to make a VID app that looke like rubular, but for parse rebolek 07:23That would be cool. I've been thinking about this, but do not have time to implement it. toomasv 15:18@gltewalt You mean ‘parse’ to ‘regex’ translator? rebolek 15:54@toomasv No, parse visualiser. greggirwin 16:38Good work on that @gltewalt! I've thought about the parse tool as well. With the callback feature, we can do a lot. Step tracing would be nice, and I think we can do that pretty easily. The trick, I think, is not to actually step trace, but to run the parse, using the callback to collect data which is then stepped through to show how it worked. There are obviously limits to that, but you're not going to use large inputs there. A parse+data debugger would be different. Wednesday 8th November, 2017 gltewalt 03:06New gist. Properly formatted. Switched from VSCode to Atom. https://gist.github.com/gltewalt/6afe7f96d6d433eb6e82d68e7417103e 03:13I think one or more of us could use the rubular layout as a starting point for the parse visualizer. I could probably stumble through creating the gui part as a view/vid learning project. https://imgur.com/a/F7vXT 03:13parse editor/visualizer geekyi 03:22https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/ 03:22Feature Visualization: How neural networks build up their understanding of image gltewalt 03:33Can someone help me with my git mess? geekyi 03:42@gltewalt git reflog -h 03:44git reset -h 03:44Basically, use git reflog to get something to reset to 03:45If you don't mind losing all the work done after a commit, git reset --hard 03:46Gtg, hope that helps 03:47If you're afraid to lose work, probably do a normal git reset 03:48But you won't really lose stuff unless you do git gc or something gltewalt 04:23I nuked it and started a whole new fork and git repository.

Going to have some strange dreams tonight. dander 17:33Anyone tried GitKraken? I just found out about it. It seems like a very full featured graphical Git client greggirwin 17:34I haven't, but that may be the best double-meaning name *ever*. 17:38Built on Electron. Let us know how it works if you try it. dander 17:41😊I downloaded it, but I don't spend a ton of time using Git (pretty big download). Just wondering if other people are using it. My first impression is that it looks powerful and polished. They have a 2-minute intro video here: https://blog.axosoft.com/gitkraken-tips/ greggirwin 19:20Electron == Big rebolek 19:26:) greggirwin 22:22Oh, the irony. Thursday 9th November, 2017 geekyi 05:35@dander I'm mainly using the built in github replacement *git-lens extension* in my ide *vs-code* 05:36A somewhat heavy editor (based on electron too), but not as slow as atom 9214 05:41http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/ElectronMass.html dander 05:42@geekyi thanks, I'll check out git-lens too. I like VS Code pretty well gltewalt 19:23I just ditched vscode. It was playing hell with formatting across a couple different things. Could have been my ignorance but I got tired of it. 22:40Is redbol actually a shallow lake pretending to be a deep lake? greggirwin 23:22Some people are just better swimmers.

Better check behind my monitor for him. toomasv 17:29I'll go chasing! 17:30The only stopping measure is this little cross on top-right :worried: greggirwin 17:31So now we need a dragon catcher, which could be used for others too, where dynamic drawing is checked for position and reset when it goes off screen. toomasv 17:43@greggirwin Right, let's keep hir in cage: Red [] dragon: func [n /local m k][ m: -1 until [odd? k: n / (2 ** (m: m + 1))] pick [90 -90] 0 = (k - 3 % 4) ] n: 0 view [ image 600x600 draw [pen red translate 350x450 line 0x0 10x0 translate 10x0] rate 120 on-time [ append face/draw compose [rotate (dragon n: n + 1) line 0x0 10x0 translate 10x0] if n = 1880 [remove/part at face/draw 10 tail face/draw n: 0] ] ] greggirwin 17:45Woohoo! You caught a dragon by the tail. toomasv 17:45 :dragon: dander 20:12neat 🐉! Saturday 11st November, 2017 gltewalt 21:41I kind of wish I could just use html css for redbol gui greggirwin 21:53Why is that? gltewalt 21:54vid is ugly ugly greggirwin 21:55You mean R2 VID or Red? Also, plain HTML is not all that fancy. 21:59Unstyled R2 VID was its own look, certainly, but you could also create styles. @rgchris was a master at this, and created some beautiful GUI styles. gltewalt 22:06I'll look for his stuff greggirwin 22:06Not sure what's public. When I worked with him on some things, it was all private. 22:08[![member-account.png](https://files.gitter.im/red/sandbox/2Gk7/thumb/member-account.png)](https://files.gitter.im/red/sandbox/2Gk7/member-account.png) 22:08There's one example. 22:09But it's all tradeoffs, right? Do you want HTML+CSS if it entails all the baggage that comes with them? And then having to write in (at least) 3 languages to create apps? 22:16Here's an app I did myself, lacking design skills of any kind. 22:16[![layout3.png](https://files.gitter.im/red/sandbox/sxXS/thumb/layout3.png)](https://files.gitter.im/red/sandbox/sxXS/layout3.png) gltewalt 22:18What baggage for css + html? 22:18The examples aren't too bad 22:24I'm saying 'replace vid'. The option to use css + html would be cool, though. 22:24I'm *not* saying greggirwin 22:28By baggage I mean things like SGML based syntax, the design never being intended for interactive UIs beyond hyperlinks and rendering structured documents, CSS looking nothing like HTML, the size of the engines behind them; things like that. 22:29*Why* would it be cool? That's what I don't get. We're trying to get *away* from that, I believe, for good reason. What makes it better? gltewalt 22:29Size, definitely. For those that don't want bloat 22:30Why would it? Because you can do some beautiful things with it. Just as beautiful as winforms or apples thing (cocoa?), if not more so - and less complex than those greggirwin 22:32So you want a non-native GUI system, that lets you use images and effects, not necessarily HTML and CSS as the mechanism, or do you want those because you know them? 22:33Maybe better to point me to beautiful examples you've built in HTML and CSS, to compare with how we might do them in a future Red GUI system. gltewalt 22:34Not necessarily html css greggirwin 22:36I can tell you, I'm not a beautiful GUI designer. Most of the time I focus on building things that work, and only the commercial products ever had concern for style of any kind. The in-house stuff, mostly plain VID (in Rebol projects) and I can't remember ever getting pushback on the look, only the functionality. If you're competing with "shiny", you do have to try to be shiny though. gltewalt 22:43Gotta drive for a bit. Get back to you later Sunday 12nd November, 2017 9214 00:05you want dedicated language(s) for GUI building, but then you dismiss VID (a language for GUI building)..? gltewalt 00:07No. 00:08manipulate some sheep: http://fff.cmiscm.com/#!/section/sheeps 00:08home page: http://fff.cmiscm.com/#!/main 00:09The much simpler css I did is locked up by HP Enterprise. I don't work their anymore, and I didn't smuggle it out. 9214 00:20I imagine there would be a wrapper on top of VID (perhaps another dialect?) for non-native UI creation, 'cuz current approach with draw and styles isn't that straightforward greggirwin 01:06Those sheep are adorable @gltewalt! Very cool. So, now we're talking about something, I think, very different than basic VID. Any idea, or way to easy see, all the code required to make that work? gltewalt 01:30No, but I doubt it will ever be on the list for the red team 01:30It would be far down the road 01:31Some revamp of vid and draw? greggirwin 01:33I think it would be ideal for a dialect unto itself. gltewalt 01:33I wouldn't know where to start - yet 9214 01:36Visual **Interface** Dialect gltewalt 05:07Anyone interested in a clojure book? https://imgur.com/a/KtBmo toomasv 06:06@gltewalt Beautiful stuff! greggirwin 18:27I love books. Are these yours you're getting rid of @gltewalt ? gltewalt 18:32Yeah - I have no use for the clojure book. Java, even indirectly, isn't my thing. 18:33I'll probably hold on to code complete. I never read 48 Laws of Power greggirwin 18:33I'll take the Clojure book then. Someday I'll get rid of all the books I don't need, but I do like pulling stuff of the shelf while researching. 18:34I'll actually be out later today if you're going to be out. Otherwise we can schedule coffee time. gltewalt 19:00I might be over in nampa this evening greggirwin 20:35OK. We can wing it. dander 22:12Regarding GitKraken, I don't have a lot of day-to-day Git usage, but I'm liking it for following the Red checkins. Its default interface is kind of like the [Github 'network' view](https://github.com/red/red/network), but faster, and easier to use. I agree the irony is pretty amusing. Friday 17th November, 2017 gltewalt 21:42Latest commit for rouge was 28 days ago... so that's not very fun. Dunno what's going on with it.

Here we have lower limit with which we start, upper limit which we can't overstep and step of intervals. What's there to fuss about? As about char! as a step, of cause it's char's int value, but is it desirable (or natural / sane) to let determine steps in char int values?

I was looking at the wrong result in a test here. 18:37It would be helpful if you included some examples, giving us a concrete base for discussion. 18:44Looks like you override num if % is used: if percent? lower [num: to-percent .01] >> range/step 5% 10% 4% == [5% 6% 7% 8% 9% 10%] 18:57Style wise, @gltewalt, there are some things that I have to stop and think about when reading it. It looks like you're going for a declarative style, in some ways, which is fine. And some things are small. e.g. unless upper >= lower [bounds-err] could be if lower > upper [bounds-err], not to have shorter code, but to eliminate the implicit negation WRT the comparison. I'd have to look it up, but I recall some research into that, and reducing cognitive load in the kind and order of comparisons and branch logic. The one I tripped over when reading it was while [(lower + num) <= upper][increment], because it reads like lower is fixed, but it's not, and increment has a double side effect. This is just at a first read though. 18:59I also don't see the use case for a char as the step value. 19:00Except that you have the type check in there, which forces you to use it for a char range. 9214 19:00@gltewalt just to point out - you left the guts wide open without enclosing all set-word!s in /local greggirwin 19:47Good catch @9214. gltewalt 19:57Rubocop tool used to yell at me for too high of density (can't remember what it's called) 20:03date/step date1 date2 2, throws error. date1 + 2 doesn't 20:04So you can have your main arguments like lower and upper, and also stick their names in /local ? greggirwin 20:06lower and upper are fine, but increment, type-check, etc. will leak out. 20:07date/step throws an error because *you* throw the error by making the step type match the arg type. Maybe not a good design choice. gltewalt 20:15Throws error without type check also greggirwin 20:19Ah, because you're doing num > upper to compare an int to a date. 20:21Another design choice. gltewalt 20:23I'm pretty bad at this lol :laughing: 20:38Could be equal? type? lower type? upper but what about more than two arguments? 20:39equal? all [ ] ? rebolek 20:56 >> same-type?: func [series][1 = length? unique collect [forall series [keep type? first series]]] == func [series][1 = length? unique collect [forall series [keep type? first series]]] >> same-type?

Shouldn't this be the responsibility of user to check sanity of his program? Why to restrict it if Red can handle this? gltewalt 21:22Well I thought it was you that didn't like the miss-matched types toomasv 21:25Where? When?

Solved it manually. 11:35@gltewalt for each row as a reverse sorted block, for all tails of this block, try dividing the first element of the tail with each of the rest until reminder is zero. Add result of division to acc. gltewalt 16:13I tried something like that last night but dug myself a hole. I'll try it again later today. I kind of wanted to generate the spiral for 3 9214 16:21@gltewalt drop your code here for us to dissect if you want toomasv 16:50@gltewalt In 3/1 you don’t have to generate the spiral. Consider square numbers in upper left and lower right corners of each square. How many steps from these to 1? How is it related to the root of the considered square number? What is closest square number to your input? How much does it differ from your input? So, how many steps it takes? gltewalt 16:51Yeah but I wanted to figure out how to make a spiral toomasv 16:53Ups, I thought you wanted to solve the problem :blush: gltewalt 16:59Both, but it bothers me more that the spiral isn't easy to figure out 17:01To generate a {string} that is like their spiral. 17:02(Sidetracked) 19:023/1 done 19:03stuck on 2/2 and 3/2 of course. Part two's are harder 19:27I'll probably share 2/2 after I re write it. I deleted last night in a rage quit Monday 4th December, 2017 toomasv 14:40Getting on day 2 solutions hard way Red [] offset: 400x400 side-x: side-y: 25 size: as-pair side-x side-y s: l: 0 col: 'red f: make font!

I couldn't work on anything yesterday, so still need to tackle that one. Same result when closing the window. Closing it again really closes it. 948+ stay for me. If that's consistent, maybe it's something to note. toomasv 17:45@greggirwin Ah, yes, confused by spirals. :sparkles: Tuesday 5th December, 2017 greggirwin 03:24I came up with a fun way to tackle Day 3. SPOILER STARTS HERE! A left-zero sniffing "turtle" walks outward in a spiral. When it gets to the target number, it takes the difference between the current position and the starting cell, which is a pair, and adds the x and y values together to find out how many steps away it is. END OF SPOILER 03:24Dang. Gitter trims empty lines. gltewalt 03:29I thought about making a spiral in view 03:34Using view compose was putting the next numbers after 1 in the top for some reason - after setting a start point with at 03:52Probably needed compose/deep toomasv 04:08@gltewalt Did you add ‘at’ for each added element? @greggirwin Nice way! For 3/2 you though need a bit different approach ;) gltewalt 04:20Yep. At wasn't working with compose toomasv 04:22With my above code it works. gltewalt 04:24view compose [ ] 04:25at (word) 04:29I'll do a small example in a little while toomasv 04:30Seems to work well: o1: 50x1 o2: 80x1 o3: 80x31 view compose [ style b: base 31x31 draw [box 0x0 30x30] at (o1) b "1" at (o2) b "2" at (o3) b "3"] gltewalt 04:47I'll show ya when I get a minute 05:49 x-pos: y-pos: 150 view compose [ size 300x300 backdrop linen at (to-pair x-pos y-pos) text "1" at (to-pair x-pos y-pos + 10) text "2" ] 06:05Other snippets go according to plan. init-pos: 200x200 run: does [ do reduce [init-pos: init-pos random/only [+ / -] random 60]] view compose [ size 800x600 backdrop 153.0.0 at (init-pos) btn: button 120x40 "Click Me" on-over [btn/offset: (run)] ] greggirwin 06:29@toomasv, yes 3/2 added a bit of neighbor logic, which also works nicely with pairs. 06:29Not going to look at 5 tonight. Did 4 earlier, but too tired now. toomasv 06:32@gltewalt You need to use either to-pair reduce [x-pos y-pos] or as-pair x-pos y-pos. gltewalt 06:37Ah, ok 06:38Looks like this stuff has some errors in it? https://ungaretti.gitbooks.io/red-language-notebook/content/gui-advanced-gui.html 06:42This has some problems: Red [needs: 'view] v1: view/options/no-wait [ backdrop blue button "unview blue"[unview v1] button "unview yellow" [unview v2] ] [offset: 30x100] ;options v2: view/options/no-wait [ backdrop yellow button "unview blue"[unview v1] button "unview yellow" [unview v2] ] [offset: 400x100] ;options 06:43I like his writing, but a few errors it looks like 9214 06:46why don't you give feedback to him? gltewalt 06:47I will 9214 10:11It's been a year since I dedicated myself to Red and this chat :^) toomasv 12:05:congratulations: @9214 greggirwin 14:13Time flies @9214. Congratulations on your first anniversary. 9214 14:13@greggirwin :older_man: toomasv 17:04@greggirwin, your turtle-idea gave me inspiration to solve 3/2 programmatically, thanks! greggirwin 18:28Cool. :^) Wednesday 6th December, 2017 gltewalt 00:363/2 is a known formula thing 02:36Made it to 4/2 02:40Uh oh. "Valid passphrase must contain no two words that are anagrams of each other" greggirwin 03:05Easier than you think, if you don't worry about actual permutations. i.e., how can you identify anagrams? gltewalt 03:17Seems like I could sort each word of a phrase then use the technique that I used for part 1 03:18 ; day 4 - part 1 total: 0 p: read/lines %pass.txt foreach i p [if (split i space) = (unique split i space) [total: total + 1]] 03:18It's on the edge of my vision but I don't have anymore time to play until late tonight 03:24If it's an anagram it's the same letters right? (sort "abcde") = sort ("ecdab") 04:49Nope that won't work. Just read the description again (mobile) greggirwin 05:04An anagram is the same letters, yes. toomasv 15:40Unusually, 6/2 was a piece of cake after 6/1. gltewalt 16:02How to make part 2 less disjointed? ; day 4 - part 1 total: 0 p: read/lines %pass.txt foreach i p [if (split i space) = (unique split i space) [total: total + 1]] ; day 4 - part 2 total: 0 p: read/lines %pass.txt new-p: copy [] foreach i p [append/only new-p split i space] foreach i new-p [foreach words i [sort words]] foreach i new-p [if i = (unique i) [total: total + 1]] 9214 16:27@gltewalt input: read/lines %D04 day-4: function [input /part-2][ total: 0 probe get also 'total forall input [ passphrase: split first input space if part-2 [forall passphrase [sort first passphrase]] if equal? passphrase unique passphrase [total: total + 1] ] ] day-4 input day-4/part-2 input 16:29essentially it's the same as part 1, only all words in a passphrase are sorted gltewalt 16:29Right 16:31That's pretty nice. 16:32would probe also total ... be the same thing? 9214 16:32@gltewalt nope, total will evaluate to 0 in that case 16:34evaluate left argument (yield 0), evaluate right argument (yield total update), return left argument (0) 16:35in case with 'total left argument evaluates to total, then its value is updated, then total is returned and its value is accessed with get gltewalt 16:36ok toomasv 16:41@gltewalt My try: foreach i p [ foreach j words: split i space [sort j] if words = (unique words) [total: total + 1] ] gltewalt 16:53:sparkles: beautiful toomasv 17:13 :angel: Thursday 7th December, 2017 9214 15:24:alien: (@geekyi :v:) ([:([:":[:|.1#~1 j.])"0 i.) 5 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ([:,.([:([:<[:|.1{.~])"0[:>:i.)) 5 ┌─────────┐ │1 │ ├─────────┤ │0 1 │ ├─────────┤ │0 0 1 │ ├─────────┤ │0 0 0 1 │ ├─────────┤ │0 0 0 0 1│ └─────────┘ (,.@:((<@:|.@:(1{.~]))"0@:>:@:i.)) 5 ┌─────────┐ │1 │ ├─────────┤ │0 1 │ ├─────────┤ │0 0 1 │ ├─────────┤ │0 0 0 1 │ ├─────────┤ │0 0 0 0 1│ └─────────┘ 15:25I'm proud of a middle one because of its nice tree ([:,.([:([:<[:|.1{.~])"0[:>:i.)) ┌─ [: ├─ ,. │ ┌─ [: │ │ ┌─ [: ──┤ │ ├─ < │ │ ┌────┤ ┌─ [: │ │ │ │ ├─ |. │ │ │ └────┤ ┌─ 1 └────┼─ " ─┤ └────┼─ ~ ─── {. │ │ └─ ] │ └─ 0 │ │ ┌─ [: └─────┼─ >: └─ i. 16:07https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xCJ3BCIudI greggirwin 17:44@9214, once you get into J, does it read clearly to you? 17:44Or do you have to kind of tease it apart to understand what's going on? I know I've had to do that with dense Rebol code in the past. 9214 17:46@greggirwin surprisingly, yes, although tacit (aka point-free) style requires some serious effort greggirwin 17:46I'll watch the talk later. Thanks! 9214 17:47I found that J encourages "active" reading, i.e. instead of just looking at the code you paste it into console and start to play around, separate different parts and draw tree diagrams like above 17:48and the interesting part that in the process you're learning new things not only about language, but data itself greggirwin 17:49Right, that's the "teasing apart" bit I mentioned, where sometimes you can do it mentally, but other times you really need to examine the live animal. 9214 17:50say, the fact that pattern above is a "lower triangle" of identity matrix =/~i.4 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 17:54reading code without console at hand requires some excessive [vocabulary](http://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/NuVoc) knowledge, it's a bit hard for me to memorize everything since English is not my native language, I wonder if every verb (i.e. function) could be visualized as some sort of pictogram 18:09s/excessive/extensive 18:12What are most fundamental and hard concepts which Redbol apprentice faces at the beginning of his journey? Definitional scoping, code is data, what else? It's hard for me to remember now :D gltewalt 19:16Data structure that can parse itself 9214 19:16wat? gltewalt 19:17lol 9214 19:17parse [][]? gltewalt 19:19redbol. More like a self parsing data format. That has the illusion of a normal programming language 9214 19:20It's just that I feel knowledgeable enough and want to do some write up on one of the topics, but I'm not sure what should it be: handwaving with "oh Red is cool because X Y Z" or separated posts "X explained", "Understanding Y" and et cetera 19:21and I'm not sure that adding yet another tutorial/article to the already diverse chunk of documentation is a good idea gltewalt 19:22Deep dive seems to be missing. There are a lot of "getting started" pages 9214 19:23by "self-parsing" you mean that code can process another code, correct? 19:23I can go with conceptual deep-dive, alas not a technical one :( gltewalt 19:23yeah 9214 19:24@gltewalt https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming gltewalt 19:24I'm not sure anyone can deep dive technically except for Carl and Nenad greggirwin 19:30Reviewing existing resources and contributing elements or clarifications to those are helpful. It is really hard to remember what it's like not to understand anything about Redbol langs once you get used to them. Maybe, like the curse of the monad, once you understand it, you lose the ability to explain it to others. :^) Or at least, you can't remember what it's like to be a beginner, which is why the view of new people is so valuable. 9214 19:32One thing that buzzes me is this: when word is bounded to a series, we can modify this series in-place, inside code itself, but when word is bounded to a scalar value, we can't do that. blk: [1 2 3] val: 4 append blk 5 ; in-place add val 1 ; why not in-place? 19:32I know that under the hood it's stack vs. heap stuff, but are there any reasons for that, aside from implementation details? gltewalt 19:364 value is immediately evaluated and atomic. blk value is a box that is deferred evaluation? 19:36resizable box 19:47Guessing that it's boxed vs unboxed 19:58Or... is it because word: is more like a place marker in code, and not a variable that references a memory location? greggirwin 19:59add val 1 not changing the referred to value is simply a language design choice. If Red did that, how would you *avoid* mutating val? Copy val? But that leads to a lot of other changes under the hood as well. In this case, val is a normal word being evaluated, so add never sees it. It only sees the result. When blk is evaluated append sees the series, which it can modify in place. If you wanted, you could *probably* choose to have the add action also dispatch to the append behavior for blocks. gltewalt 20:10I 'guess' my guesses were wrong greggirwin 20:14All values in Red are boxed. gltewalt 20:15Did Carl ever publish a white paper type of thing? greggirwin 20:15Nope. Not AFAIK anyway. Never even an official spec of the language. gltewalt 20:46So, I think I'll get back to advent this evening. Day 5. Looking at the description is it: for offset n --> increment n by 1 --> move n - 1 greggirwin 21:48@9214, another element at play here *is* how datatypes store their values. Not exactly boxed vs unboxed, but some types can store the value entirely inside the type information struct. Others refer to data that is stored elsewhere. All datatypes have a 128 bit struct, and they all use the first 32 bits as a header. Beyond that, the other 96 bits are specific to each datatype. If a datatype has to deal with more than 96 bits of data, it *must* store it somewhere else. That, of course, affects performance and complexity. Friday 8th December, 2017 gltewalt 06:05This is slowwwwww: nums: load %reg.txt count: temp: 0 while [not tail? nums][ temp: nums/1 either nums/1 >= 3 [nums/1: nums/1 - 1][nums/1: nums/1 + 1] unless tail? nums [nums: skip nums temp] count: count + 1 ] print count greggirwin 07:15How slow is slow? How many block ops total? gltewalt 08:12I dunno. Have to run your timey thing on it toomasv 08:36I had 21'841'249 cycles. Several ops in each cycle - comparisons, increments, length measurments, skips - no wonder it takes some time. gltewalt 08:48Big input 09:13Rebol2 == 0:00:52.654 Red == 0:01:25.317 9214 10:21@greggirwin thanks for clarification greggirwin 19:11On performance, a vector is a bit faster, but not massively so (~25% for me). You could also use temp in place of 3 nums/1 calls to see how much effect that has. Ultimately, Red is going to be slower for things like this, because everything is very high level. 19:39Just tested, and vector isn't any faster for this problem. 19:39Mine is really slow in any case, as I just wanted to get it right. :^) 19:41Need to make time to get back to things. Skipped a couple days now. gltewalt 19:57That's all I've been doing - trying to get the answers right. I don't even make funcs for most of it greggirwin 21:03Sounds like you still have a bug then, as their examples should work. gltewalt 21:03I'm guessing that I'm wayyyy off checking for what is seen before 21:03Wrong answer with official input - but no infinite loop 21:08Probably two things wrong. Where I increment cycles and where or how I test for a repeat pattern 9214 21:53@gltewalt are you comparing banks with a snapshot of a previous state of banks? 21:54if so, re-read the task and example 21:55you need to check if current configuration already appeared *in all previous states* 22:08occasionally solved Day 6 :shipit: 22:14do you guys save your solutions somewhere? gltewalt 22:30Oh. Yeah I was 23:10Since it's Christmas party night, I guess I'll have to wait awhile to fix it greggirwin 23:39I haven't posted my solutions anywhere. We could collect them though, for fun. Then I'd have to clean mine up though. ;^) 9214 23:39so far I thoroughly enjoying Day 8 23:40Red is really suitable for such task greggirwin 23:42Guess I should look at 7 so I can get to 8! 9214 23:44:godmode: 23:44[![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/red/sandbox/qrt2/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/red/sandbox/qrt2/image.png) greggirwin 23:46Go 9214, go! Saturday 9th December, 2017 toomasv 04:29@9214 :+1: Yes, D8 was very Reddish to do, especially after the discussion of inc functions. 15-16 LoC. Good idea about saving solutions somewhere. I would enjoy learning from your tricks, guys. dander 06:35I've been saving all of mine, though I'm still on day 3 of this season (this week has been very busy, and I'm trying to get enough sleep). 8 of them from the last season. I really like these problems for exploring Red, because they are difficult enough to stretch a bit and explore new areas, but not so big to be overwhelming 9214 08:30@toomasv since you've mentioned inc, I guess our solutions are quite similar (combination of parse, string transformation, loading and a couple of user-defined functions) toomasv 11:26@9214 Nope, I didn’t use parse, neither string manipulation. 9214 11:27@toomasv hmmm 11:29and how did you implemented inc and dec operators, managed non-existent registers? toomasv 11:40I used my own ‘inc’, later changed to @dander’s. But basically, in ‘until’ loop till ‘tail?’, “took” 3 into prg , skipped 4, “inserted/only” somewhat manipulated prg,and “did” it. ;) 9214 11:41> I didn’t use ... string manipulation @ > somewhat manipulated :japanese_goblin: toomasv 11:42Block 9214 11:43:angel: ah ok 11:44still, what about non-existent registers? 11:44say, when you encounter ab for the first time toomasv 11:44They were initialised to 0 in until loop 11:47I.e. whole input block was first changed into Red code, then ‘do’-ed 9214 11:47then maybe my solution is slightly over-engineered, now I think that I solved it this way only because defining grammars in parse is pure fun 11:52https://gist.github.com/9214/766efd750382a030c2b706c12aec27c0 toomasv 12:00Mamma mia! Impressive! I’ll put up mine when at computer 12:54https://gist.github.com/toomasv/90ac7ff36cc570b8b3b3d68bf1fbdc6e 12:59Could have won 1 line by making inc and dec op!s. 9214 13:03oh, move usage, that's neat! 13:04@9214 makes a mark in a "list of nifty tricks to remember" list toomasv 13:07Actually, tried now to make inc into op! and didn't succeed :( 9214 13:08@toomasv op! doesn't allow quoted arguments, that's why I asked about implementation later toomasv 13:08I see, thanks! 13:10dec: func ['value step][set value (get value) + negate step] is stupid. Should be dec: func ['value step][set value (get value) - step] 9214 13:13well, it reminded me to try to see things from different perspective, so, not that stupid toomasv 15:09Bragging: 10 LoC today 9214 15:10you can always squeeze it down to 1 if you want :eyes: toomasv 15:14Yes, but they are more-or-less logically spread out 15:1719 when quite strict 15:26Down to 7/14. greggirwin 19:36I won't peek at your Day 8 solutions until I do my own, but now I want to see them! @dander, I agree that they are fun. Since I can't compete on time, I enjoy thinking about them in different ways. e.g., for Day 7, you can easily trim commas and then load the input and make blocks for processing. Maybe I can do part 2 today. 9214 19:38@greggirwin on a first sight that was my thought too (about trimming commas and loading) Sunday 10th December, 2017 gltewalt 07:31Day 7. But this might be as far as I can go. I don't really have experience with tree and graph stuff 9214 14:28@gltewalt you don't need to build a graph for the first part greggirwin 18:18@9214, indeed. I didn't. gltewalt 21:03I read ahead a few. Looks like 9/1 wouldn't be hard at all if you transform { } to [ ], trim out , and use tag! to look for garbage 9214 21:07@gltewalt it's not that simple with garbage gltewalt 21:23Close enough that I have an idea what to do. I don't have that with 7/1 toomasv 21:30D9 is really simple with string parse. 9214 21:30@gltewalt you have a set of names of all programs, and a set of names of programs to which someone points to. No one points to the bottom program. How can you find its name? gltewalt 21:33If his name isn't in set of names to which someone points to? 9214 21:33yes gltewalt 21:34use difference? 9214 21:34yes! gltewalt 21:34Woohoo 9214 21:34or exclude gltewalt 21:37:+1: Monday 11st December, 2017 greggirwin 04:14Secrets revealed! :^) gltewalt 05:09Do you guy transform the data and then work on the challenges, or just load it and work on the raw stuff? 05:13@9214 How about writing a parse article? You could go deep and still make it accessible 05:30Hmm, Christmas present? https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0262036630?psc=1 9214 06:57@gltewalt I have 2 major topics in mind: definitional scoping and parse, but they can be mashed together in a more long, less detailed post of handwaving and conceptual rambling. 07:02but again, writing separate piece of documentation smells badly to me 07:32@gltewalt :point_up: [ it depends](https://gitter.im/red/sandbox?at=5a2e1318540c78242dac3917) toomasv 08:00I ‘load’ or ‘read’ the input and depending on task, start to transform or use it. Never transforming manually. Well, I did it once in the beginning, and decided not to do it again. gltewalt 11:49@9214 well, there's only parse introduction link under Documentation on red-lang 11:52You guys could add to https://github.com/red/red/wiki/REBOL-Core-Users-Guide:--A-walkthrough-with-Red 11:53Or correct it where needed toomasv 15:0410/2 needed quite tricky logic on "circular blocks", eh? And it would be very interesting to share solutions on d11 hexagonal grid. greggirwin 17:51@gltewalt, I set up a few loader funcs to help with some inputs. Others are easy to just load directly. I'm falling behind now, with other things taking priority. :^( toomasv 18:25@greggirwin Understood, duty calls. Thursday 14th December, 2017 gltewalt 03:11I think parse doc is needed more than any other doc 9214 06:10@gltewalt can you tell me what in your opinion is missing or unclear in existent documentation and what would you like to see? 06:22can't decide if such doc should be a separate post in a personal blog (yeah I want to please my ego) or a github-wiki-based entry :confused: gltewalt 06:56Blog. 9214 06:56why? gltewalt 06:57It's better for you. And will possibly capture those outside of Red world 9214 06:57so it should be aimed at a wide audience and newcomers, hmm gltewalt 06:58And can put the blog link on the wiki. 9214 06:58@gltewalt so, what would you like to see in such parse article? 06:59and what feels challenging enough that you having hard time to dig into it on your own? gltewalt 07:01Could do a multi part blog. Beginner friendly, and deeper dive. I like the style of that Michael Sydenham blog, but he doesn't cover very much 07:03For my brain I like lots of small examples. Task or Concept -> example, Task or Concept, example ... repeat 9214 07:04@gltewalt yeah, I would like to come up with some tongue-in-cheek (but practical) exercises/examples 07:09guess I'll start to make a draft in my spare time gltewalt 07:09Task categories with different Kung fu moves. Or you could even go through the red-lang parse intro and give examples for each entry in the table that follows "The following keywords are currently available in Red's Parse implementation. They can be composed together freely." 9214 07:10@gltewalt yes, tables and summaries for sure, I already have a bunch of undocumented (i.e. not described in red-lang parse article) keywords in my pocket (keep pick/ collect after / change) gltewalt 07:11If you make it how you like to learn things, it will probably be good 07:12Good blog gives you a chance to appear in HN 9214 07:13it's not about be, but about language adoption 07:37ew, s/be/me Saturday 16th December, 2017 toomasv 15:23[unicode.red](https://gist.github.com/toomasv/e819fa2452f38a15cea6e20182ab9309) Fetch range.red do %unicode.red unicode/chart 'ascii ft: make font!

That's fantastic @toomasv ! toomasv 20:17 :abcd: :bowtie: Wednesday 20th December, 2017 gltewalt 03:37 How do we do PR again? (from git command line) 03:38Or do we have to click the button on the Red github page? 9214 03:48on github greggirwin 03:49https://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull, but normally I push to my fork and do the PR from there in the GUI. If you use Tortoise, you can also do it when pushing with that. gltewalt 03:49I did push to fork and used the gui. And crossed my fingers. greggirwin 04:03I see your PR but, like I have often done in the past, you have a whole bunch of unrelated commits in there. They won't accept a PR with 115 changed files for a minor spelling correction. More than once I've gotten things into a state where it was easier just to make a clean clone of the official Red repo and start fresh. 04:04I can close that PR for you if you want. gltewalt 04:04ok, I guess I can make a fresh clone greggirwin 04:06You can play with various git commands to try and clean it up, but I usually just make matters worse when I do that. :^) gltewalt 04:20Do I need to delete my fork too? Friday 22nd December, 2017 geekyi 13:42@gltewalt pull-request is a github thing. Gitlab's name for it is merge-request. The name says it all, it is a request for another person to git pull (or more often, git merge) 13:43I usually use git sync instead of git pull, git push 13:44Also, if it's a minor edit to a single file, I usually do it on github's website, where it takes care of all the logic 14:53:point_up: [December 7, 2017 8:24 PM](https://gitter.im/red/sandbox?at=5a295d22ba39a53f1a308178) @9214 :smile: gltewalt 20:05Merge makes more sense 20:06And you’re not really pulling anything, your asking the main branch to pull in your stuff. So you’re pushing to it Or merging greggirwin 20:29You've pushed to your fork, yes, then ask for a pull because you don't have rights to push to the other repo. Or you have a process in place that *nobody* can push to the repo, because someone always has to approve other people's work. gltewalt 21:22Which would be a good idea with me lurking around ;-) greggirwin 21:23And me. gltewalt 21:23Command line is easy enough for me - it’s a matter of reps. I don’t do it enough to remember Tuesday 26th December, 2017 gltewalt 23:30:facepunch: Wednesday 27th December, 2017 9214 12:06:eyes: 12:06[![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/red/sandbox/WH8l/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/red/sandbox/WH8l/image.png) rebolek 12:09It was longer version of this https://twitter.com/hostilefork/status/945455027874705408 gltewalt 18:15And this 18:15https://imgur.com/a/EwPPb 18:19Why would he have deleted it himself? Seems to have no problem leaving things up elsewhere 18:20(Deleted the red page comment himself) 9214 18:25write something yourself, then delete it, then publicly insist that it wasn't you but moderator who has something against you and that everyone is bad and conspiracy is everythere :shipit: rebolek 18:35Let's just ignore negative stuff. It's better for everyone. 9214 18:36:sparkles: :star2: :rainbow: stay positive :rainbow: :star2: :sparkles: 18:38gonna play Doom 3 then, mostly to enjoy sound design :feelsgood: rebolek 18:42:) gltewalt 21:03What if numbers were series rebolek 21:04What is series were numbers Thursday 28th December, 2017 greggirwin 06:15How do you mean @gltewalt ? gltewalt 06:16If 1234 could be treated as [1 2 3 4] 06:171234/2: + 7 => 1934 06:18:scream: greggirwin 06:19What would be the purpose? In any case, you could create a dialect to do it, or get close. 06:20Basically, you have to treat the number as a series of char! digits in some base, which kills performance for actual numerical work. gltewalt 06:20I'm not sure the purpose, but it would allow for some really weird stuff. Our number system is 'kind of' a series from right to left greggirwin 06:21Then we can also say any value should be a series, because that's how we represent them all, yes? gltewalt 06:21yep greggirwin 06:22What then happens with pair! values? i.e., how do you address their parts versus their digits? gltewalt 06:23What do you mean parts? greggirwin 06:23 >> p: 100x200 == 100x200 >> p/1 == 100 gltewalt 06:24same as [1 0 0]x[2 0 0] 06:24p/1/1 06:24p/only 06:25p/1 could be head greggirwin 06:25I encourage you to try it as an experiment. :^) gltewalt 06:25Oh, you wan't me to go mad? :smile: greggirwin 06:25Too late for that. ;^) gltewalt 06:26:laughing: 06:34perilous... >> the-deep: make bitset! [#"0" - #"9"] == make bitset! #{000000000000FFC0} >> to-integer to-binary the-deep == 0 >> the-deep/1: true == true >> to-integer to-binary the-deep == 1073741824 06:36I don't really understand that, but I'm sure it is too perilous 19:25Holy crap, a couple rooms are flooded greggirwin 19:34I'm drowning too. 19:36Really exciting though, and maybe @rebolek can mine stats with gritter that Doc can use when promoting Red during the upcoming events. rebolek 19:39@greggirwin I'm reading D3 docs right now, hopefully should have some examples tonight. gltewalt 19:40Might be time to consolidate documentation type stuff 19:42I have most of the differences with Red and the Rebol/Core chapters (not all chapters). Maybe a few of us could double check my examples and assertions and 'paraphrase' the Core guide. To make a Red Core guide 19:42I'm not sure of the legalities though greggirwin 19:43I have notes for a Red Core Guide here, but we do want to be careful because Carl was very clear that he didn't want others reusing his hard-wrought documentation. rebolek 19:49D3 fortunately supports dates in form of 1-Apr-17 so exporting stats to CSV would be easy peasy. The hard question is **what** stats to export? I have sooo much data... 20:07So let's start with something trivial, like number of messages per room. 20:25But first I need to solve some mold quirks, omg 20:25why can't things just work gltewalt 21:00What data would you look for? rebolek 21:01That's the question, I have **all** data :) 21:03Posts per day/month, post per user, issues mentioned in posts, links, code samples, questions, ... gltewalt 21:05How about separating pre Christmas @names from the new participants? 21:06like a memoization table 21:06Then you could chart newcomer activity separate from overall activity 21:09It will lose some context if you’re mining subject because conversation will be one sided, but it could pinpoint new activity rebolek 21:17Separation by date is easy. 21:18I have first graph ready. 21:19I just need to get my FTP credentials, I had stored them in Firezilla that stopped working with recent Firefox update :) 9214 21:32what are the most common questions (obvious), most active users (are all in this room), income of newcomers after each announcement gltewalt 23:24make-dir in Red is exactly the same code as make-dir in rebol2, except that Red uses cause-error and rebol has its make error! 23:24Is that a legal issue? 23:25Rebol: return make error! reduce ['access 'cannot-open path] Red: cause-error 'access 'cannot-open path rebolek 23:30cause-error calls make error!, see the source gltewalt 23:51Ok 23:51I was just wondering about the identical code though rebolek 23:52Oh, I see. Friday 29th December, 2017 gltewalt 01:18If one of you can get a little time, skimming through my walkthrough to make sure it's kosher would be a great help 01:43So, this is kind of neat: view [b: button "Press" [?? b]] greggirwin 03:21@gltewalt, time is tight lately, but I'll try. 03:25@9214, "Can I write a webserver with it?", "How do I make it work in the browser?", "Why no GUI on Linux?" gltewalt 03:34It won’t compile with Linux. “?” 03:43(the i386 stuff, even though it mentions it on the downloads page) 05:21Any idears why my web-cam image saver thingy only captures an image intermittently? Other captures are all black greggirwin 06:53I think you're the webcam pioneer at this point. Saturday 30th December, 2017 gltewalt 19:10@9214 can I legally get tons of money? 9214 19:10sure, work hard and incorporate Red in your company/startup/whatever gltewalt 19:15That’s for you QA bag. Sunday 31st December, 2017 gltewalt 03:57 greggirwin 04:27:^) toomasv 09:00@gltewalt Might be me - very practical theoretician recently poofed into programmer :relieved: greggirwin 17:22"Practical theoretician". I like it.``
