[21:51](#msg5a4bfec9b48e8c356691dd3b)Correct, you don't need `/as` then, but it can make things easier sometimes. Propagating refinements can lead to more complex code. By having a refinement that lets you \*optionally* include an arg (effectively), any wrappers can just always use `/as`.

One possible use of macros can then be word-aliasing, for example translating words at compile-time (using French words here):  
#macro si: func \[]\['if]  
#macro affiche: func \[]\['print]

&gt; The "official" Telegram chat is Public. It is open to anybody with a Telegram account. Any bots used to gather and re-publish information from Telegram are outside the purview of the Red team, and so are neither endorsed nor restricted by the team, but should honor any rules or limitations Telegram imposes for bots and content extraction. If you operate a bot against a Telegram room, it would be polite to inform the members of that room of the bot's existence.

At a glance SmileBASIC doesn't seem to, so how are you going to represent "compound" types? Lex all those. Now you can `load` all Red data, including nested blocks and objects, cool! How hard was that? Now all you have to do is implement all the datatypes to handle their actions, and natives. From their it's as easy as any other interpreter for a multi-paradigm language that uses definitional scoping. ;^)

[21:39](#msg5a6265996117191e6189f22e)Maybe look at it like this, Rebol was the best and easiest language with which to build Red. Eliminate the compiler from Red, and you have a working model. That is, I don't think it can be any \*easier* than the current Red interpreter, and likely a lot harder.

What you need to ask then, is how much you can remove, to start small.

[02:32](#msg5a6941c2ce68c3bc74fe0983)@gltewalt The Red &amp; Red/System test suites are regression tests. We don't have unit tests for the toolchain or the runtime. (This is not uncommon for programming languages. Lua does not have unit tests. Its regression tests are extremely rigorous though. \[We need a big effort to improve our regression tests.]

It might be worth trying some local testing on your changes and only running the regression tests once you think your changes are working.

Really hard to answer without digging in, but it's a small graph database written in JS, so should be possible. Anytime the words `crazy distributed database` appear, `easy` doesn't come to my mind when playing word association.

[07:39](#msg5b77cd45e40fdf5fb155a287)@9214 could be interesting for `memoize` to take a list of args to act on. e.g. `/with`, where the default is to memoize all args.

9214

[07:42](#msg5b77cdf6e40fdf5fb155a4f7)@greggirwin that's what I'm thinking too. Problem is that with list of args you won't get perfomance of map and hash, because they explicitly forbid series as keys.

I'm swamped without a trusty working station right now and leave it for curious minds to figure out.

9214

[17:55](#msg5b785d74802bc42c5f399900)Take a function, clean up its spec from docstrings and typesets, convert refinements to words, handle lit- and get- arguments. Reduce this block and check if its a key in your "memo" - if it is then return associated value, otherwise extend "memo" with key / value pair and return value &lt;-- this logic should be embedded in a newly constructed version of a function that you should return back.

[00:35](#msg5b78bb6a087c4c20b500a2f6)@9214 good point on the data types issue. That would defeat the single level map too wouldn't it? Was there some discussion about more general support for key types in maps? I suppose you could hash the values yourself and use that to look up values.

I'm also not sure it makes sense in the context of converting values. That is, `to-*` should be idempotent if the arg is already the target type (ignoring `copy`ing), where your last example would create deeper and deeper nestings with `/only`.

What is the use case behind it? Your ideas most often come from real world use, so let's look at that.

[02:33](#msg5bd6716f069fca52a5ae0a60)@BeardPower yeah, both are great. I think process hacker has quite a bit more information in the single app (though not so much if you combine the other sysinternals tools)

[02:38](#msg5bd67299069fca52a5ae10c9)process explorer has the old regmon/filemon builtin for tracking registry and file access/requests. it's worth having just for those

[02:44](#msg5bd67423c7bf7c366287677d)@dander: not sure about the suite, last I remember they rolled those tools that stopped working after Xp into process explorer. at some point microsoft bought them out, I haven't really kept up

[02:53](#msg5bd6763cef4afc4f28ea27c7)Maybe I just didn't notice them in there. Anyway, there are several gems. It's worth noting that though Microsoft did buy them out, it's still maintained somewhat by the same authors.

[16:11](#msg5beeec3780e46b4266bf9faf)Here's my first draft of \[memoization](https://github.com/9214/whatnot/blob/master/red/memoize.red). It doesn't handle `'quoted` arguments well, raises a couple of design questions (order of refinements in function call, treating series arguments with `same?` comparator), but overall seems quite robust (although I haven't check anything much).

```
inspect: func [function][
    probe new-line/skip 
        get in context? first select body-of :function 'any 'memory
        on 2
]

factorial: memoize func [n][
    if n <= 1 [return n]
    n * factorial n - 1
]
```

```
>> factorial 10
3628800
== 3628800
>> inspect :factorial
[
    [1] 1 
    [2] 2 
    [3] 6 
    [4] 24 
    [5] 120 
    [6] 720 
    [7] 5040 
    [8] 40320 
    [9] 362880
