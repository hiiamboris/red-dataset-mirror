meijeru

[09:55](#msg63b15877c4fec572d663aff8)I have no specific use case, but I was exploring how far one can go in making Red emulate a functional language --in other words use it for functional programming. Red already has functions as first-class values, after all.

[19:02](#msg63b1d8ac63c9fc72d3090182)@meijeru some people have done experiments in that area. Some things are easy, e.g. always copy series. Here's one of the deeper experiments: https://gist.github.com/numberjay/3df8f13044145c6dde1918ea2cdfe3b8

WayneCui

[01:44](#msg63b236f8378d512c18402b7c)So it a feature ;-)

greggirwin

[01:44](#msg63b23718c4fec572d66539c9)Correct, it is by design, like `append` works.

WayneCui

[01:47](#msg63b237c863c9fc72d309a6f3)I see, thank you for your info

meijeru

[13:35](#msg63b2dd9a8f8df4262ad2d55c)Observation: `rejoin` cannot only be used on `string!` values (which I suppose is anyhow the most frequent use) but on values of many types, in particular `block!` values, e.g:

```
>> rejoin [[][1 2 3]]
== [[1 2 3]]
>> rejoin [[1 2 3][]]
== [1 2 3 []]
```

[13:37](#msg63b2ddfe63c9fc72d30ad490)

```
>> rejoin ["" "abc"]
== "abc"
>> rejoin ["abc" ""]
== "abc"
```

&gt;

[13:37](#msg63b2de070dba35742357aaf0)Is anyone bothered by this?

hiiamboris

[13:39](#msg63b2deae8f8df4262ad2d880)Yeah, sometimes. But I rarely use it on blocks.

meijeru

[13:58](#msg63b2e3168f8df4262ad2dede)I tried the same with `vector!` values and this is even worse! `rejoin` uses `append` which uses `insert`, and the latter action does NOT accept a `vector!` value as its second argument (it will accept a `block!` though).

```
>> v1: make vector! [1 2 3]
== make vector! [1 2 3]
>> v2: make vector! [4 5]
== make vector! [4 5]
>> append v1 v2
*** Script Error: invalid argument: make vector! [4 5]
*** Where: append
>> append v1 [4 5]
== make vector! [1 2 3 4 5]
```

[13:59](#msg63b2e334c4fec572d6666999)Worth filing an issue??

hiiamboris

meijeru

[14:18](#msg63b2e7b2378d512c18416c19)I am glad I did not rush into filing a new issue, but I am sad that this is still not resolved! @dockimbel assigned himself last september so we may have hope...

hiiamboris

[14:32](#msg63b2eb18fb195421bd663243)Vectors need total redesign, so that's why probably fixing it is not a priority

## Thursday 5th January, 2023

meijeru

[16:18](#msg63b6f86540557a3d5c5f8e4e)I observed that the `only` refinement on `find` disallows the use of datatypes as search argument

```
>> find [a 1 b 2] integer!
== [1 b 2]
>> find/only [a 1 b 2] integer!
== none
```

Is this a bug, or a conscious restriction, and if so, why?

hiiamboris

[16:27](#msg63b6fa78c4fec572d66e5608)Because sometimes you don't want the smarts:

```
>> find/only reduce [integer! block! string!] block!
== [block! string!]
```

Hello, can `binary!` data compare with different base? Or is there any way convert one to different base?

Also, see help on `enbase` and `debase`. Better yet https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/datatypes/binary.adoc

[10:03](#msg63c27e04ff1fd121b343bc2b)Just working on a Hessian data (java) deserialization client. I love `PARSE` ;-) https://github.com/WayneCui/red-hessian/blob/main/hessian-v1-parser.red

hiiamboris

[10:13](#msg63c28041fb195421bd83d454)you might wanna `parse` the result of `enbase` on this screenshot as well

[10:14](#msg63c2808d4bbc000f09402c32)though for performance I would recommend using charsets instead

luce80

[10:17](#msg63c281200cd40c2e89d5e419)Is there a way to know if my script was run from console prompt or not ?

hiiamboris

[10:18](#msg63c2815dc9591d20d3a0f1e7)by console prompt you mean...?

luce80

[10:23](#msg63c282a4378d512c185f5cf2)Yes, so I can quit without closing the console window.

hiiamboris

[10:28](#msg63c283dc3b37dd2c117b0510)so you mean Red GUI console then

[10:29](#msg63c28401c9591d20d3a0f673)easy.. just check `index?` of `system/view/screens/1/pane`, or `system/console/gui?`

[10:30](#msg63c28443ff1fd121b343c92a)but generally if you don't want to quit, just don't use `quit`, use `unview`

WayneCui

[10:41](#msg63c286d34bbc000f09403765)

```
two-byte:   [copy first-byte skip if (parse (enbase/base first-byte 2) ["110" to end]) (append buf first-byte)]
```

You mean this way? @hiiamboris

[10:41](#msg63c286d9c9591d20d3a0faac)Yeah, it works as well

hiiamboris

[11:01](#msg63c28b8c0dba35742375a013)yes, but you can write a single rule to cover all 4 cases

WayneCui

[11:31](#msg63c292a9d8678973f9b06a0c)Thanks for your advice, I will try it @hiiamboris

## Wednesday 18th January, 2023

WayneCui

[14:03](#msg63c7fc3ac47d581062977a4f)Can Red script read the content of the stdout or stderr, eg. if `print {Hello world}` , then got "Hello world"?

[14:09](#msg63c7fdaf06f8e06b0c787daf)My testcase would start a java server, and it would print the listening port to rhe stdout, but the port is different every time. I want to get the port automatically by read from the stdout

hiiamboris

[14:28](#msg63c801fab1f383475e0a7735)No, you need ports for that and they are not implemented. You can read a file though.

WayneCui

[14:36](#msg63c803f0d86fd34ee55f58cf)Thanks for your info.

hiiamboris

[15:02](#msg63c80a0d3031eb3361847f4f)@WayneCui it probably won't help you, but you can also capture the stdout output of the processes started from Red with `call`, when they finish.

## Thursday 19th January, 2023

WayneCui

[02:39](#msg63c8ad6a6f6a0b74193fb54a)@hiiamboris It would be fine if it works. The java process has started, but `call` can't return back, Maybe it's because red is single-threaded?

[02:40](#msg63c8ada3c47d58106298c7ba)\[!\[image.png](https://files.gitter.im/5565a1d415522ed4b3e10094/o0wg/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/5565a1d415522ed4b3e10094/o0wg/image.png)

```

Listening on http port: 54942, ssl port: 54943
```

I know what you mean by \*\*when they finish\** , when I killed the java process, I got what I needed

[02:52](#msg63c8b07cf2b13e5e50f8716d)Anyway, this is not a MUST feature

ldci

[08:16](#msg63c8fc70c98ea74762a923ff)@WayneCui. May be you can try `call/wait`-&gt;Runs command and waits for exit.

WayneCui

[15:03](#msg63c95bb07bcbfb74311e0b06)Make it with a temp file as @hiiamboris suggested ;-)

```
tmp-file: %port.tmp
call/output "java -jar ../support/hessian-test-servlet.jar" tmp-file
data: read/lines tmp-file 
parse data/1 [
    thru "Listening on http port: " copy http-port to "," to end
]
?? http-port
delete tmp-file

hessian-proxy: make hessian-proxy-base [
    point: to-url rejoin ["http://127.0.0.1:" http-port "/api"]
]
```

[15:06](#msg63c95c5a06f8e06b0c7b131e)@ldci It is a long-runing web server, I need get the listening port after it has stated, but not when exit.

[15:09](#msg63c95d3215734c6b1235ccd6)Then there is another question: how to kill the server process when test cases all finished?

[15:19](#msg63c95f8621f77a334d9a2564)Have cover 70 test cases. If you have Java installed on your computer, can play with it. ;-) https://github.com/WayneCui/red-hessian

[19:12](#msg63dfffb84ecd45446ec6c744)HTTP is not yet part of the Red runtime, so no "simple level". Also you'll need the \[IO branch](https://github.com/red/red/tree/IO) to run it.
