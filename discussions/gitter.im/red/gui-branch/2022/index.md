https://www.nngroup.com/articles/golden-ratio-ui-design/

Lots of "old news" there for some (I designed a log spiral that was etched into the floor at my old house), but a few tidbits I didn't know. While https://grtcalculator.com/ doesn't seem to work right now, could we use that idea for smarter layouts, and tools that suggest settings? But what struck me as not-too-hard, useful, and fun for the graphically oriented, is the image cropping idea.

planetsizecpu

[08:09](#msg61dfde1c2a210c38c1c75690)Interesting how you workaround the lack of sound @ldci so you call sox `play ...` on each beep.

The main idea I have at this moment is to create a Vid object that will have `rate n`, but not visible on screen, so game funcs will manipulate some freq or note field on this object, depending  
on how sound works, to play some effect sound or note. But there will be a global sound effects switch as in all the computer games, if it is ON then `n` rate parameter will be set to some fixed value so the sound func will run with the object parameters, but if switch is OFF then `n` rate parameter will be none so will not play sound effects although the funcs will manipulate the object. So the sound will play asynchronous and not delaying the gameplay.

For background music is the same idea with a different Vid object, the question is that I don't like to set a sound file, I better prefer to code some notes because the melody \[Turkey In The Straw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr8QnkTwT\_w)  
is simple, say `melody1: "AEBCDFCDGEACDEBC" melody2: "BCDEAFCGAEBCFED"` so on each `rate` tick will consume a note.

I don't know at this moment how will come sound, is just my idea by now, one key question is if sound will be available on console, to test notes, so we can compose any melody much more easy, if not then will have to make some sound mockup script to test sound alone.

greggirwin

[19:43](#msg61e080ea5dc6213cd4de1924)@chunes3 how I often start is by writing the VID code manually first, just a small bit, so I can see what I want the data to look like that I'm going to generate. Then build the pieces to generate one item. e.g. the set-word (name), style, and facets. With that, you're pretty much done and just have to assemble the parts and drive it from other data.

[19:44](#msg61e0813a6d9ba23328bdf092)Also, generate your data and compare it to the manual version you wrote. Preview that before feeding it to VID and you'll learn a lot.

[19:51](#msg61e082ae7842bd3ca944f3c2)I encourage you to try it on your own, but here's a spoiler: https://gist.github.com/greggirwin/9c32a31a366631ce159d2ac1d5fb89f8

[12:00](#msg61f3daeb526fb77b31a02068)@GalenIvanov Would like to ask something towards the animation dialect. I can see the following pattern, where `expires`looks kind of repetitive / busy:

```
start 1 duration 2 ease :ease-in-out-quad
    stroke-path test (path) width 15 color (papaya - 10.10.10) expires after 4
```

Could the expiration instruction be moved to the first line? Or is that this way, because you can have multiple strokes as shown on the second like, each with its own expiration timeout? Does the first line mean, that what follws (is indented) is a group of multiple instructions?

GalenIvanov

[12:10](#msg61f3dd469a33545406458253)@pekr Thank you for your question! I'll upload the documentation in the weekend (or at latest on Monday).  
`expires` works only with "compound" effects - `particles`, `text-fx`, `curve-fx`, `stroke-path` and that's why I decided to declare it at the effect level and not at `start`. `start` works like `pen` and similar - changes the state until the next `start`. There might be many effects after `start` and each can be delayed by some time, if there was `delay` keyword. That's why I decided to set expiration time for each compound effect.

pekr

[12:32](#msg61f3e2652a210c38c1eeabad)Were you thinking about grouping stuff? I would not hesitate using blocks .... for things like slides, multiple strokes, etc. Because even in Powerpoint, which I am using for animations for our LED screen, you set delays, expiration, repetition for the slide itself, as well as for its selected elements, separately.

GalenIvanov

[13:02](#msg61f3e9525dc6213cd40462e5)I was thinking about blocks following `start` declaration, so that all animations in that block to start relative to it, but have't tried it. I added named animations, so that they can be used as references.

hiiamboris

[20:16](#msg61f44f3b7842bd3ca96bf3a3)&gt; passion into your job can change how you feel about it

I'd say, there's an unnoticed self delusion in this case, different for everyone. For example, if one loves to dance one can dance for oneself, and get recognized like \[Marquest Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBqb3mkmQ7Q). Maybe you won't get as popular but you'll have enough, and a lot of fun. Or one can join some govt-sponsored club of good for nothing shadows that live and breathe boredom and only get invited by organizations to provide background for some official events. In the latter case one actually abandoned his dream by refusing responsibility for it and only pretends to follow it.

[15:22](#msg61f7feaa5ee4df335a0ff458)@GalenIvanov Would like to ask about the duration of animations. Is there any possibility to accelerate / slow-down? I can see, there is `on-time` event, so one could probably use that section to program that. Just curious though. In vide editing software, we've got key-frames, so that you can divide the path to multiple points and set various parameters to such a node and between nodes use diferent metrics of acceleration, slow down, etc. Maybe @Oldes could share some ideas from his Flash experience :-)

GalenIvanov

[18:29](#msg61f82a79bfe2f54b2e46325d)@pekr No, there is no such possibility.

[18:49](#msg61f82f272a210c38c1f67843)I am still quite versed on longish one liners, respectively, if there should (or not) be some grouping, like panel in VID, simply by using brackets. That way, you can create (named) groups, set parameters to the whole group vs the contained elements, consider them being a slides, frames, etc.

GalenIvanov

[18:53](#msg61f8302bd143b14f83447af5)I know. You are most probably not the only one to want blocks for animations. I'm writing the docs right now and I'll explain there why I decided not ti use blocks. In short - I think of `start 2 duration 3 delay 0.5`as a fame of reference and not a container, since there might be subanimations "sticking out" after these 3 seconds.

[18:56](#msg61f830e4e1a1264f0a833001)I might change my opinion if there is enough evidence to support the use of blocks :)

pekr

[19:06](#msg61f83328d143b14f83447f7f)This might be thing of some kind of compatibility, with VID for e.g. VID uses options, which you can use at the top level, but you can use `with`to access the object directly. Jeff Kreiss did the presentation as a VID extension, so you could use buttons and other elements:

```
field "Brutally maiming the competition" with [font: []] 0:0:16 [
			:0:1 fade red 20 body 
			:0:1 fade yellow 20 text
			:0:1 go 110x200 5

[03:00](#msg622c0cbfd1b64840db6146a1)@toomasv Did you use `get-scroller` to get the scroller! object? like this one: https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/environment/console/GUI/gui-console.red#L115

[03:01](#msg622c0cfae9cb3c52ae104114)You can get two scroller! objects.

toomasv

[04:18](#msg622c1f143ae95a1ec195aa30)@qtxie Yes, I did it so (\[here](https://github.com/toomasv/table/blob/master/table-template.red#L819)):

```
vscr: get-scroller face 'vertical
hscr: get-scroller face 'horizontal
```

Nevertheless, parent's `on-scroll` actor's `event/key` is `track` for both, and it can't be decided whether to send it to `hscr` or to `vscr`. See e.g. \[here](https://github.com/toomasv/table/blob/master/table-template.red#L555). May-be I am just confused?

qtxie

[12:05](#msg622c8c976b912423202e1a39)@toomasv Ok. I know the issue. We can put 'vertical or 'horizontal in `event/flags` to distinguish them. Or do you have any suggestions?

toomasv

[12:20](#msg622c8ff9c61ef0178e6d07b8)Yes, that seems to be one solution. Another would maybe be to use different word for horizontal tracking, e.g. `thumb`. Or may-be use `htrack` and `vtrack`? But this is perhaps too cryptic. And `end` key has same problem, so probably including horizontal/vertical in flags would be more general.

[09:02](#msg622db32ec61ef0178e6efb7e)@hiiamboris From Red Spaces docs: "host uses it's rate and draw facets internally, requires all-over flag to be set, but the other facets can be repurposed as you see fit.":

\- I wondered what Host means, after reading doc, it is ok. So just an idea - why not call it Spaces? It would resemble the subsystem we try to use? That'r really minor though ...  
\- Usage of the `all-over`. When View was introduced sometimes in 1999 or so, it used that by default and it was really slow for any meaningful work back then (Pentium 75 / 135 was my PC back then :-) ). Later on it became a special flag only for cases, when it was really needed. Why is that needed in Spaces all the time?

hiiamboris

[09:28](#msg622db94dc435002500ebb4b9)`host` is more to the point IMO, but I'll keep your suggestion in mind

[09:29](#msg622db9763ae95a1ec1985da0)&gt; all-over

How else do you propose tracking pointer?

[09:37](#msg622dbb5d9a09ab24f3a0ac95)Also `host` won't be necessary in the future as I will create VID styles for common host spaces.

pekr

[09:38](#msg622dbb7b99d94f5f0c4b55ae)How is that being tracked in view itself? Does it relate to spaces being mostly a Draw window, hence you have to turn on all-over, to get precise positions?

hiiamboris

[09:38](#msg622dbb980909252318211b97)View tracks all events in it's R/S code.

[09:41](#msg622dbc449bd1c71eca9e4b7c)Then dispatches it to faces depending on over flag configuration.

[09:41](#msg622dbc59257a35782528e7b4)But on a Draw surface you don't have faces, so it won't dispatch. I have to do that myself.

pekr

[09:41](#msg622dbc5f99d94f5f0c4b571b)Taugh call then ... you would have to resort to use regular faces with separate draw blocks ... btw - that's what Carl's GUI did ...

hiiamboris

[09:42](#msg622dbc820909252318211d65)That would be stupid of me and will significantly slow everything down :)

pekr

[09:43](#msg622dbcae161ffc40d7b23429)So Spaces are basically one Draw window, which draws its widgets, hence you need all-over to get the precise position events. I am just trying to think, how to get down to the R/S level.

hiiamboris

[09:44](#msg622dbcec3ae95a1ec1986512)If I go down to R/S level, almost nobody will use spaces because of compilation requirements.

pekr

[09:44](#msg622dbd12f43b6d783ffc3b76)I can't express myself enough ... what I mean is - what about a completly new View, with the access to the R/S code, where widgets are being drawn by subsystem similar to Draw, just having access to R/S code?

hiiamboris

[16:32](#msg622e1c83090925231821d680)@pekr how much "too slow" is `spaces`, and what is the best example of that?

pekr

[17:02](#msg622e23bf9a09ab24f3a16da9)I did not say Spaces is slow. I do remember using all-over handler is slow. But even with Demos hiiamboris admits, that those can be laggy (stated in docs).

hiiamboris

[17:04](#msg622e24119bd1c71eca9f0266)you're mixing it up

pekr

[17:04](#msg622e24129bd1c71eca9f026b)Maybe that's why there were GOBs with the R3. Those could be of a text, draw, effect type IIRc and faces were higher level construct, built upon GOBs.

[17:05](#msg622e2468f43b6d783ffcfa78)That's possible. What I did understand (maybe incorrectly) is, that Spaces are basically one Draw bitmap upon which everything is being drawn? So one base element at the low level OS mapping?

[17:08](#msg622e25168db2b95f0a6642bb)but so were all R2 faces

greggirwin

[17:13](#msg622e2630161ffc40d7b2f077)My point is that we first need to evaluate `spaces` and see where improvements are needed.

pekr

[17:13](#msg622e264ac435002500ec7ee1)Guys, you don't need to care that much about my remarks. Clearly I can't even ask the correct question :-) What I had in mind was something like - what if there would be the version of the View engine, without OS widgets mappings and having accelerated Draw with clever clipping/caching engine at its guts, as a first class citizen. I can't even envision, if such a question makes any sense .....

hiiamboris

[17:15](#msg622e26ccc435002500ec7fea)Draw is not going to be a bottleneck for Spaces. For Animations - yes.

[18:13](#msg622e345d6b9124232030f4d1)I'm thinking of using ranges for description of spaces' size constraints. Because, obviously I do not want the mess of HTML with it's `min-width` `max-height` etc crap.

E.g. `label "Some text" 200 .. none weight 1` would allow the label to stretch once it's container is resized, but over the minimum of `200`.

I'm okay for using an object for now, but @greggirwin any news on range! datatype?

There's also use case for half-open pairs, e.g. smth like `100xNONE .. 200x200` (impose no lower limit on Y). But just mentioning it as food for thought right now. If pairs were floating point we could leverage NaN for that. `100xNAN`, `100x-INF`...

[18:36](#msg622e39ba6b9124232030fe09)In retrospect, `1x2` syntax for pairs is good but limiting. If we had `,` as alias we could use a form like `nan,100` while we can't write `nanx100` (it's a single word).

## Monday 14th March, 2022

greggirwin

[01:13](#msg622e96c70466b352a41942d8)The literal form for ranges is the trickiest part. We can mezz around with its behavior in the meantime. Also, @dockimbel has mentioned `(x, y, z)` as a literal `point!` form in the past.

[10:17](#msg622f164cc61ef0178e717aef)So glad to see some action being taken on Scroll bars. Working scrolling on multiline text boxes with word wrap enabled has been a big limitation IMHO

hiiamboris

[13:45](#msg622f4701c435002500ee804f)@greggirwin both the benefit and the trickiness of `nan,100` or `(x,y)` is in words. We want words, maybe even parenthesized expressions, so we can evaluate them. But then two questions arise:  
1\. It's not a terminal lexical form. `,` now unifies not only 2-3 numbers, but may contain words or expressions. It's like an object with 2-3 keys/values (and a decorated way to `make` it?)  
2\. If there are words/exprs in this limited object, when does the actual evaluation take place? When we get the numeric value out of it?

I wonder if there was any talk about this and how can it be solved?

[13:53](#msg622f48c199d94f5f0c4e1f2e)For ranges, we could start without literal form. Mold it as `make range! [a b]`. And make `..` a non sticky constructor operator. `a..b` - not a word anymore.

## Tuesday 15th March, 2022

greggirwin

[04:36](#msg623017d90466b352a41c1993)@hiiamboris agreed on the parenthetical form issue. I don't know how Nenad intends to address those issues, but we should note them.

I also agree we can start `range` work without a literal form. As appealing as `..` is from a familiarity standpoint, making it not a word is an exception I'm not sure I like. It seems like it would be too easy to trip over, but it's also not the only one.

greggirwin

[19:51](#msg6238d73c8db2b95f0a7abcaa)I will have to play to see, but am working on many fronts at the moment. For GUI editors, the first thing I thought of was selecting a face and showing sizing handles. That leads to being able to select multiple faces and how to be smart about sizing. e.g. sizing a face in the upper left \*might* automatically adjust other faces offsets that it overlaps. Maybe it does that by default, but holding ctrl while dragging overrides it.

Other things I really want in everything is standard undo/redo capability. In the case of UIs, it would also be great to copy the entire layout to do what-if comparisons without having to copy files on disk, load multiple projects, etc. This starts moving into the realm of responsive design, or what Atronix called Semantic Zoom, and automatic resizing. That's much bigger, so a simple manual option is where to start.

It is kept fixed, yes. In sorting/filtering it is not considered - only data below it in current order are considered. About "accessing data via code using an index" I need to think of still.

[07:20](#msg626a4022949ae940067f4a65)Ah, so it shuffles data. Remember Cyphre's attempt at grid, where he prevented that, hence the order was mapped virtually, because I can't imagine you move such big chunks of data around?

toomasv

[07:27](#msg626a41c689dcc96e9cd808e3)It is relatively little size single draw, using clipping for cells boundering - so no arbitrary faces. For that you should use @hiiamboris `spaces`. But it can show arbitrary images and draw in cells, i.e. anything that `draw` can show. This needs more work though.

[07:28](#msg626a4233eaf3267f8535fdc3)And, as I said, only picking data by index into pre-existing draw-cells, not suffling original data, unless original data needs to be changed through all table.

toomasv

[07:48](#msg626a46d246495f47cfb6100d)&gt; to open and close the table at the same row position

Yes, it will come when I implement saving preferences, i.e. selections/freeze-settings/sorting/filtering/current-position for current table.

[07:50](#msg626a4747cd35b566afbd3c8b)&gt; how many selection modes are there?

You can select with mouse and with navigation-keys. Shift-down will extend selection. Ctrl-mouse will start new selection-range without removing previous ranges.  
Selection with hot-keys will come, e.g. ^A. Some keys for selecting row and column too.

pekr

[08:00](#msg626a49afd30b6b44ebc23be7)One useful mode for selection in database apps, is just having hilited the whole row, not only a single cell, so that you can more easily identify, where you stand. But .... the basics are definitely good and improvements can come later :-)

About last question - not my call. And my guess is no. Also, I can't test on other platforms. It is developed on W10, but as I have not used system code, it is possible in principle that it compiles on other platforms too. Not too optimistic about that, though.

I just need to have the first/last or the central row positioned at given index at opening (one of them, I actually prefer the central one); and also have the corresponding position returned or accessible when closing the table. It is need for reaopening and bookmarking.

[08:48](#msg626a54e4a687887f8d7d351a)@GiuseppeChillemi Ok, I'll think about these issues. Thanks for suggesting.

[09:20](#msg626a5c48d4ef6e15af1e9ed7)@GiuseppeChillemi Can you please explain with some example, what do you mean by "accessing data via code using an index" :point\_up: \[April 28, 2022 9:19 AM](https://gitter.im/red/red/gui-branch?at=626a3206cd938f6ea21f3370) There are principally three ways to specify address of data: COLxROW in original table, COLxROW in current index (may be sorted and filtered), and COLxROW in current visible view. If I understand you correctly you mean COLxROW as in current index, counted starting from next after last frozen row (and col?). Or something else?

GiuseppeChillemi

[10:05](#msg626a66eb9db19366b202c012)Accessing data = reading or writing data in any of the VIEWS you have mentioned, where you express which data you want to access using the "views" you have mentioned.

```
face/data  (Index is from head)
face/filtered (Index is from head of filtered data)
face/visible (index is from the head of visible data)
face/source (Index  in the original data)
```

So you can write:

```
`select-cell face/data idx 'column ` ;or just `select-cell face idx 'column `
`select-row face/data idx`
```

or

```
`select-cell face/filtered idx 'column `
`select-row face/filtered idx`
```

or any of the other accessors

Note: I usually think as ROWxCOL , because it is more natural as it corresponds to path way of organizing data, as in `DATA/:IDX/COLUMN` (if block of objects) or  
`DATA/:IDX/(index? find column-list column-name)` (if block of blocks with columns on the first line)

[12:27](#msg626a884dd30b6b44ebc2b89d)This:

```
face/data  (Index is from head)
face/filtered (Index is from head of filtered data)
face/visible (index is from the head of visible data)
face/source (Index  in the original data)
```

Could also be this, where the refinement represents a different view.

```
face/data  (Index is from head)
face/data/filtered (Index is from head of filtered data)
face/data/visible (index is from the head of visible data)
face/data/source (Index  in the original data)
```

If it could be useful to not pollute the face context with words.

The implementation to save it as file is a great idea. So you can load the table OFFLINE, share it and write back from another session. Please consider having an `EXTRA` section so we/you can add useful data to it like `original-source`

toomasv

[14:48](#msg626e9dbfbb0de60c721baab7)&gt; which is the difference between REMOVE and DELETE?

REMOVE removes given column from column-index, so it is not shown. All removed columns are restored with RESTORE.  
DELETE deletes column from original data, Deleted columns can be restored only by reopening the file (unless you have saved it with column deleted).  
HIDE sets column width to 0. It is still in view and can be copied, just not seen. UNHIDE sets width of all hidden columns to default size.

greggirwin

[16:30](#msg62700728d30b6b44ebcca33d)Sounds like our problem is solved, once `spaces` is ready. :^) Though `spaces` has a lot more, and if the rest of your UI is native, there \*may* be cases where someone wants a single, drop-in style for that. Again, though, unless someone wants to do it on their own, it's not on the team's roadmap.

hiiamboris

[16:36](#msg6270087314df4e44f207948e)Native GUI is quite bad fit for that due to it's scalability issues and bugs. Of course you can make a small list of 5-10 layouts.

greggirwin

[16:42](#msg627009e614df4e44f207980c)Many UIs are simple, but there's still the issue that desktop OSs aren't designed to have their controls/faces repeatedly created and destroyed at speed. You can do it of course, and there's no \*technical* reason it shouldn't work, but a pure `spaces` approach would be much better. I don't know how mobile OSs or langs implement them, but it's a dominant model there, so anyone looking at it should research there.

[16:47](#msg62700b36d4ef6e15af28ee68)And the old grid styles that allowed things beyond text weren't completely extensible in that regard. You had just a few options, like those @GiuseppeChillemi mentioned. Check boxes and images being key.

How it worked, historically, in something like Excel is that it's all drawn, like @toomasv and @hiiamboris are doing. So there is no real checkbox. Just a drawn box and code that knows clicking on that cell should change its state to draw with a pattern-filled box.

As Boris notes, you can also do this at small scales, even without a real scrolling panel or doing more than changing faces visibility. You just create them and change the data. No, you don't get that nice feedback of seeing things move incrementally (which they don't in all UIs anyway), and it's a pain to work with so needs helpers, but it can be done.

[19:17](#msg62702e339db19366b20d28a0)What some other systems do is like old line editors. All the data is display only, but then you can activate a line/row for editing interaction.

The problem with using native controls is that faking it then means emulating the look of a button for each OS, which ends up being a huge pain. But @toomasv has already shown that logic fields work, and a "button" could work the same, very simply as a demo, but once again you run into all the extra handling, tracking a pressed state look when mousing away, etc.

[19:01](#msg6272cd86d30b6b44ebd1eb78)@9214 asks the key question in that NaN sorting ticket.

&gt; How other languages handle that, BTW?

If NaNs are technically floats, and we support them as a value, `sort` should \*never* crash because they exist. That's step 1. Step 2 is whether they produce nonsensical sorted results for NaNs themselves. That's bad, but not our fault (again, technically). But given that it affects how other values sort, it's bugged.

```
>> sort [3 2 1 0   1.#NaN  -1 -2 -3  1.#INF -1.#INF]
== [-1.#INF -3 -2 -1 1.#NaN 0 1 2 3 1.#INF]
>> sort [3 2 1 0 -1 -2 -3  1.#INF -1.#INF  1.#NaN]
== [1.#NaN 2 1 0 -1 -2 -3 1.#INF -1.#INF 3]
```

We \*should* do the most helpful thing for the user, and that means keeping them together. If we choose not to do this, we have to clearly doc the issue. I'm OK with noting that custom sorting needs to be NaN-aware, but we should provide templates for people to copy.

hiiamboris

[19:20](#msg6272d1effa846847c94c8896)https://dlang.org/library/std/algorithm/sorting/sort.html (last example)

[19:21](#msg6272d23cfa846847c94c88fb)negative nans are a bit of an overkill though

[19:24](#msg6272d307eaf3267f8545b57a)D has put a lot of thought into NaN handling. For example there are operators `!< !<= !> !>=` (negations of comparison - made especially for NaNs). Our COMP\_SORT comparison just needs to be NaN-aware like that.

greggirwin

[00:12](#msg6273166841f4560c6f8597cb)Thanks @hiiamboris. :+1: Red normalizes NaNs, but I recall using them inline caused issues at one point. @qtxie please give your thoughts on the NaN approach D uses. I don't think we want special ops for them, just transparent handling. When we have our own decimal type, it will matter even less.

[00:20](#msg6273183261f5ca3feee78e6f)On paging, from the recent chat here, I agree that better querying and filtering is the most effective place to invest time and effort. But I'm also a stupid human who sometimes forgets to use `everything` to find files, and that's OK. There are times where the act of looking for what I want leads to other discoveries. Personally, that's where paging falls down for me. Seeing tiny chunks of data doesn't \*really* let me browse. At the extremes browsing doesn't work well either, but there's a huge gray middle-ground between 100 and 1M items. I always thought fisheye menus were cool for browsing, but they also fail at scale because you can't control the mouse movement in fine enough increments. That could lead to a new, hierarchical or spatial browsing model of some kind I imagine.

[00:23](#msg627318e7d4ef6e15af2eb184)Say your scroller is actually a 2D box. At the far left you scroll like a regular scroller. But the more data you have the wider it gets, and as you also move the thumb to the right, it slows the vertical scrolling. Of course, it could be horrible in actual use. :^)

[00:24](#msg62731944cd938f6ea22fa4bd)It's also very much related to context and what you're trying to do. At the conference yesterday, more than one person talked about how they \*loved* using graphs to see overviews, then be able to click on data points to open the source data (e.g. logs).

qtxie

[08:35](#msg62738c3ca687887f8d8e2e9d)@greggirwin I also think we want it to be handled transparently. Especially make `sort` NaN-aware.

[03:49](#msg6279e0c6bb0de60c72306219)As for the `with`, it stems down to VID, where you can kind of inline other configuration directly to the underlying object using a `with`keyword. During R2/R3 times, I think I have seen `options` used, can't remember which GUI version used that though.

greggirwin

[03:56](#msg6279e27589dcc96e9cf4dc6a)Thanks @toomasv. Sometimes I can't find things right in front of me.

I like `config`, as `layout` is already taken. :^) No on `setup`.

Are there other places where `options` is used directly in VID? There is some overlap, as we can have new facets, but also group them, like `extra` overlaps this need. And all generic words. My thought about `with` comes from seeing that, and in the context of VID where it has nice meaning. I'm not set either way, and it's a bit late here, so I won't think more until my brain is fresh.

hiiamboris

[07:34](#msg627a1570eaf3267f8553036b)If config is a facet that lives with the widget, `with` is the most \*direct* way to work with it, and it will be easier to access if one wants. If it's just data that gets read and discarded then `options` wins because it doesn't require you to allocate a facet for it. Or if you think this data is not going to be accessed by anyone, thus you kind of hide it. What seems extra then is `options [config:`, why can't it be just `options`?

toomasv

[07:57](#msg627a1ad741f4560c6f925eb6)Thanks for explanation, @hiiamboris ! I agree with all points except last, because `options` is used primarily for some predefined things not set by my template, e.g. in case of table: `[style: table vid-align: top at-offset: none]`. `config` is added to these once on initialisation, so it is preferred to be kept in `options`. I'll consider making it mutable during execution, in which case it will be transferred to separate facet and set on initialisation with `with`.

[03:31](#msg627b2e0b9db19366b221a59b)If it is list of sizes of columns, then you have to include column numbers too, like `[1 81 2 50 3 126...]`. Otherwise it is interpeted as: column 81 has width 50, column 126 has width 99...

If these are consecutive columns, then you can do it like this:

```
sz: [81 50 126...]

[09:26](#msg627b815f10cfc315bc736b6e)@GiuseppeChillemi Great! Notice, that if you use `focus` keyword on your table, then the cursor-cell will be "active" at once (i.e. you can move it with navigation-keys). Otherwise it will become active after a click on table only.

GiuseppeChillemi

[09:41](#msg627b84e0cd35b566afdd407b)@toomasv Is there a common actor that triggers either when you select a cell via mouse click, or via navigation keys, or via some `set-focus` function?

toomasv

[09:49](#msg627b869846495f47cfd5fa58)`mark-active`, but it currently takes only relative coordinates of cell as visible on screen. I still have to make a more general function for selection. There are now buds of `find-in-row` and `find-in-col` funcs also, accessible from menu. `find-in-row` just seeks strings in cells; `find-in-col` works similar to filtering, but instead of actually filtering it just marks matching cells.

GiuseppeChillemi

[12:27](#msg627baba7d30b6b44ebe27033)Nice, you find, filter and get values. Some observations:

From code you should be able to do the following:

`Get/Set/Select XxY`(or `YxX`)  
`Get/Set/Select XxY to XxY`  
`Get/Set/Select XxY to XxY`  
`Get/Set/Select XxX` &lt;- Whole Rows  
`Get/Set/Select YxY` &lt;- Whole Columns  
Other than `columns`, filter by one or more `rows`

Also, it is really important that `get-filtered` or `get-data`, `selected-data` like operations, could return data in these formats:  
`data` or  
`data + indexes`  
`indexes`

The most important one is the last, as it with indexes you can later `get/write/select` the original cells.

[12:31](#msg627baca689dcc96e9cf87c6e)And the indexes/coordinates could be relative to filtered view or to the original data.

[17:56](#msg627d4a37eaf3267f8559669c)I don't think that's a silly example at all @toomasv. It shows exactly how it works, and very clearly. Very nice!

[18:03](#msg627d4c09a687887f8da0a70f)On formatting, we definitely want to use `format`, rather than duplicating effort and having multiple systems. This work will push that back on the priority list. @toomasv new example also brings to mind that HOFs should be applicable to selected data, which may be defined as above or via cell ranges. So HOFs come back up as well.

Coloring isn't part of `format`, but there is overlap in how things work, including how a `table!` type works and maps to UIs as simply as possible. I haven't looked at the internals of `table` to see how data structures map architecturally. Future work.

One of the key aspects for formatting (including coloring) is the hierarchy (scoping) of application and how to make it efficient. Another aspect, which comes down to design choices, as none are perfect, is masked inputs for editing. AFAIK there is no "winner" in this area from UX research. I'd love to be wrong about that.

For me, conditional visualization is just color names or tuples returned by a function you pass the current cell value . Colors could be either for text and backgrounds. Later, this function could return other font attributes.

toomasv

[18:15](#msg627d4eb041f4560c6f98c17e)Thanks, @greggirwin ! Yes, I like it myself too :)=  
The thing is, `copy-selected` generates two global words - `selected-data`, refering to you-know-what, and `selected-range`, refering to addresses of cells from which data were extracted. Data are extracted exactly in order you selected cells. After `copy-seleccted` you can select either single cell or new range, which has to have same length as data previously selected (may be I'll loose this requirement). With `paste-selected`, if single cell is selected then previously extracted data are pasted into table according to the figure in `selected-range` but relative to the given cell. If a range is selected (matching the size of extracted data), then data (possibly edited) are pasted into the selected range, again exactly in order as the (new) range is selected. :hmm: Hopefully this makes some sense...

greggirwin

[18:18](#msg627d4f7d41f4560c6f98c2e8)@toomasv that's \*great\*. By making it data driven and declarative (it could be, done in code). It's powerful because then you can create "forms" or entry points into a spreadsheet, insert data, it recalcs, and you can extract data from "result" ranges.

toomasv

[19:09](#msg627d5b87fa846847c960812d)@GiuseppeChillemi No, table is strictly block of blocks, but data extracted by `copy-selected` and pasted back by `paste-selected` is flat block.

Significant only for bigger files of course. If files are opened (from text-list), then it reads 1000'000 bytes and cuts on last newline. Query results are expected to fit into memory, but I should actually check the size and decide then how to open it - as normal or large.

@GiuseppeChillemi From a quick glimpse, it's not possible with the `prev-chunk`, `next-chunk` actors, because they seem to be a bit opinionated on how to retrieve the prev/next chunk and implement the retrieval by themself instead of executing configured handlers. But I'm really not judging or questioning the design here, I'd rather wait for more docs to see what is possible.

## Friday 17th June, 2022

hiiamboris

[08:30](#msg62ac3bacab6b634f734a1bcd)&gt; `menu` option should be configureable directly in VID via `menu [ ... ]`

Agreed. In spaces that's how it works.

&gt; should be possible to directly inline expressions/values in VID rules without `compose`, using parens or something similar

Also how it works in Spaces. This is tricky though, as requires a trigger, like `data`. VID can only extend the set of triggers, but it can't magically know if next token is a keyword or expression, so this notion is limited.

&gt; ability to refer to the current window at all times

You have it: `view window: layout [button "Show me" [? window]]`

&gt; there should be an option to make a widget (reactively) fit the bounds of its parent, so when the parent is resized, it is also resized

What I aim to achieve in Spaces is that resizing should always work automatically out of the box with zero effort. Kludge for VID: https://gitlab.com/hiiamboris/red-elastic-ui

&gt; ability to set minimum/maximum size for windows/widgets

Agreed. I also introduced this. But this can only be a part of the resizing system.

&gt; "message box" widget, or helper widget

Could be useful, just nobody designed it. VID makes it easy for anyone anyway.

&gt; color picker widget (unless this can't be done natively?)

I think @toomasv has one.

&gt; "grid"-based positioning system

VID has it: `view compose/only [panel 3 (probe map-each x "ABC" [map-each y 3 [reduce ['text rejoin [x y]]]])]`  
!\[](https://i.gyazo.com/ef54caaddd4014cd19090b6890f0598f.png)

Spaces have an infinite more powerful grid. I don't think native VID ever will though, as there's no such OS widget.

&gt; Alt-shortcuts and keyboard shorcuts should be configurable for menu options

And they should be right in the menu block! But this needs design. E.g. how to denote shortcuts (datatype, DSL), and where to insert the keyboard hook.

&gt; should be able to configure a menu option as disabled

Agreed.

&gt; menu options should allow for inline code (rather than just an ID)

Discussed this in /help.

&gt; ability to have a button selected/highlighted by default

You have it: https://w.red-lang.org/en/vid/#focus

&gt; filtering input should be possible (using Parse and/or charsets, or something similar)

Agreed, but again needs design and ties with the (missing so far) part of the formatting work - input validation. It's tougher than it seems at first. But for simple cases you can abuse `on-key`.

&gt; escape key should deselect all text

I think it's up to OS, not us. ESC is a nonstandard behavior.

&gt; should be able to manually send special events like undo/redo, copy/paste, etc

Agreed. In Spaces I added an `edit` DSL that has commands like `undo` and `redo`.

&gt; should also be possible to override them

Here I'd like you to elaborate the use case.

&gt; (text widgets) should support rich text at some point, somehow

Spaces will have this eventually, but I'm not there yet. I don't think there's a native control for it. Do you have an example code in Tk that proves me wrong? I can't make much sense of the info by the link you mentioned.

&gt; should be able to change cursor position

Yes. Very annoying limitation.

&gt; should be able to customize cursor

Disagree here. You only do this in fully featured editors, not in input fields.

&gt; revisit Ctrl+(key) events, as `Ctrl+S` registers the key as #"^S" rather than #"s" or #"S" (with ctrl?: true)

It's `#"^S"` in `on-key` but `#"s" + ctrl?` in `on-key-down/up`. This is how OSes work. Not our doing. `on-key` gives you a composed character, not the key itself.

&gt; some keys like delete and escape should also return `word!`s rather than #"^H" and #"^["

Agreed.

&gt; setting the value of a widget should be reactive. for example, `my-area/text: ""` does not replace the text of the widget

You must have a bug somewhere. Show the minimal code.

greggirwin

[15:37](#msg62ac9fd076cd751a2f430fea)Thanks for your thoughts @ALANVF, and for your feedback @hiiamboris.

@toomasv does have some color pickers. Let me find my requester experiment.

[15:38](#msg62ac9fe6568c2c30d3d0e398)https://gist.github.com/greggirwin/9cd640ca42bdfd56c5ff4432c4765d2c

[17:46](#msg62acbe099f73251a2c5bba7c)We've talked in the past about R2's `list` style, which was great but had some limitations. @toomasv has a working and quite advanced `table` style now, and @GalenIvanov is going to coordinate with him and R&amp;D a `tree` style. I think there's still value in `list`, which offers rich layout for "rows", and an associated style would be an `accordian`, that is, sections that expand and collapse, like a tree, but with richer content/sub-layouts. Not sure where a code-folding editor falls in this, but that's basically a data tree. @henrikmk and @rgchris have both done some great UI style work in the past, so I hope we can get some good thoughts and momentum going in this area.

henrikmk

[18:06](#msg62acc2b20a52264798512222)I've recently taken to building a few applications in pure R2 VID, where I'm using LIST heavily. One note is that the SUPPLY method automatically makes it easy to window quickly through infinitely sized lists. I don't have to consider updating the list at all, and I use a picker function inside SUPPLY to get the data needed and a render function to render the cell output correctly. The iterated face method drives the rendering fully. Where LIST is weak is handling multi-selection.

greggirwin

[18:08](#msg62acc3198fe56a38b59ee42c)It also has issues when you \*do* need to update data, IIRC.

Thanks for weighing in.

[18:11](#msg62acc3b69f29d42bed815f0e)I also think the `list` style is an exact fit for what happens in a lot of mobile apps.

[18:12](#msg62acc4229f73251a2c5bc645)Another issue, which I don't have an answer in my head for, is that the rows are equally sized. Consider one of the most common "lists" in use: chat. If we can nail that use case, there's a lot of leverage there.

henrikmk

[18:37](#msg62acc9eb0a52264798513351)Does Red support an iterated face method, and if so, can it be customized?

greggirwin

[19:20](#msg62acd3f576cd751a2f437b03)It does not, at this time, but should be doable at the mezz level. All R2 styles are.

GiuseppeChillemi

[20:14](#msg62ace09c22c53438bca6f254)Lists with different row height let you handle chats easily. I have a couple more interesting uses like displaying tables content with carriage return/lf in it.

greggirwin

[20:22](#msg62ace294ab6b634f734b780b)For me, Telegram is a reference standard in this regard.

[20:27](#msg62ace3c4ef5ee44882b256d9)AltMe did a great job for its time as well.

GiuseppeChillemi

[20:30](#msg62ace47576cd751a2f439d3c)Agree

greggirwin

[20:32](#msg62ace4d31227f62be3a41e08)AltMe surely used something like `list` and faces internally. We can scale up as we R&amp;D. Start with fixed height rows, then let heights vary, and see how it might all be done with `draw`, like Toomas' `table`. Lots of playing we can do quickly. A key aspect is that editing doesn't have to happen in the list. An edit window comes up for that. It does need some interaction though.

GiuseppeChillemi

[20:32](#msg62ace4db76cd751a2f439e2c)I didn't know a tree widget was under development. Also I have seen you have pushed for file dropping support. All are great news

greggirwin

[20:33](#msg62ace5249f73251a2c5c08a8)`Tree` is just being evaluated now.

[20:35](#msg62ace588568c2c30d3d1706f)Another thought here is that infinite lists are hip and trendy, but that doesn't mean they're best. e.g. I have to scroll for days to find old messages by date in Telegram. Unless there's a feature I don't know about. Being able to filter data is powerful, and allows us to load all data that is less than "everything from forever".

[20:36](#msg62ace5c476cd751a2f439fad)Even AltMe's simple `before/after` date filtering beats modern chat apps.

GiuseppeChillemi

[20:36](#msg62ace5d29f29d42bed81a736)Another important piece. Red foundation is block and it is Hierarchical data.

[08:52](#msg62ad9254ef5ee44882b3975f)@henrikmk I tried back in 2017 without success and lost interest. The only thing that worked is this "not-automatic" ;) version

[04:25](#msg62b68e3676cd751a2f605d47)Put `on-up` before `below`. It is window's actor and must be set before any other elements in layout, or separately in window's options. Idea is to use actors of table's wrapper element, i.e. window in this simplest case. If there are more elements in layout, then you have to wrap table into panel and use panel's actors. Actors of table itself cannot be used as they are already defined. (In principle they can be twisted by user to accommodate his needs of course.)

greggirwin

[19:26](#msg62b761771227f62be3c6850b)There's a reactive aspect, but I also think there is big potential in how we define the data that lets us enforce and automate many things. It's another way to leverage our rich type system and being a data format first.

[19:31](#msg62b76289ab6b634f736e8194)For example, in a DB stored procedure, you can enforce constraints, but how do you do that on a role-based system, and give the user quicker feedback? User Bob can set `max-agents` to `200` at most, but Admin Alice can set it to `5'000`. If those rules come down and the UI is built from them, based on who is getting the content, it can also build in a message telling Bob to contact Alice if he needs more agents. Can you do this with an error result from the DB, maybe, but if we can group things together, we leverage context and information locality for the analyst or dev.

GiuseppeChillemi

[19:32](#msg62b762d722c53438bcc9698e)In fact, we are a data format. When the Red Pill has made his effect I have started to see this and its big potential. I have accumulated some ideas since then and I will try to do my best to make those ideas a reality.

[18:02](#msg62b89f4fab6b634f73771fcb)I have a question: I have a text area on which I will allow selection by mouse, but no key inputs. I have a handle-key function defined as actor for on-key events, and it tests if the focus is on this area. If so, I ignore the key event. However, it turns out that the editing (insert, backspac, delete) is done by the system BEFORE the handle-key-event is transmitted? It does not help to make the area disabled, because then I cannnot select by mouse. What to do?

[15:41](#msg62bc72a69f29d42bedc894ea)I took table-template apart and put it together again so that now it is easier to manipulate virtual (i.e. active) rows and columns. As you remember `auto-index` used to add a auto-indexed column to table. This changed now into `auto-col`, and it got a partner `auto-row`. `auto-col` and `auto-row` themselves have index 0, e.g.:

```
view/flags [
   on-resizing [tb/size: face/size - 20 tb/actors/resize tb] 
   tb: table 317x167 data 10x20 focus 
      options [auto-row: #[true] auto-col: #[true]]

[15:43](#msg62bc732ffe909e3ec71cceef)Virtual rows and columns have negative indexes:

[15:49](#msg62bc747d9a314a3ec4f9d2ae)But this makes it cumbersome to enter formulas with row and column numbers, e.g. `R4C4` refers to cell with row header -1 and col header 2. So you'll have to just count the rows and headers. Not good. So I added an option `sheet` that turns row/column headers into plain index:

```
view/flags [
   on-resizing [tb/size: face/size - 20 tb/actors/resize tb] 
   tb: table 317x167 data 10x20 focus 
      options [sheet: #[true]]

[15:53](#msg62bc756e904f20479a5104b7)`sheet: #[true]` will always add both row and column headers and these will always show plain visual index of given row and column, not their index in original or virtual data.

[17:21](#msg62bc8a1a1227f62be3eb9fb0)I think it is a good solution. It is important that you can get a index to the original column/row asking something like `get-base-index`

[17:27](#msg62bc8b8476cd751a2f8b601c)There you can have 2 types of multiselection with or without an additional control key, at least this is what I had on Rebol

Use ON-CREATE to populate an object with your important faces, eg:

```
MIF: make object! [start-button: none text-fields: copy []]   ;; My Important Faces
view/no-wait [
    button "Start" ON-CREATE [mif/start-button: face] [print "started"]
    text  "Text 1" ON-CREATE [append mif/text-fields face]
    text  "Text 2"  ;; not an important face
    text  "Text 3" ON-CREATE [append mif/text-fields face]
    button "Also start" [mif/start-button/actors/on-click mif/start-button none]
    ]
    
mif/start-button/text: "Begin"    ;; change button caption
foreach face mif/text-fields [face/color: pink]  ;; change color of all important text fields

[19:06](#msg62d85224904f20479a17ef88)Hi  
I'm rewriting a rebol script to red:  
`view/no-wait` with a forever loop after that calls `wait` does not work. It seem like the `wait` does not let the graphics update as it does in rebol.  
What function can be called in the loop so that graphics gets updated?

@rebolek I am now using your `codepage.red`script. Now I don't understan what is happening:

```
probe pg: read-cp read/binary https://agerborsamerci.it/listino/web.htm 'ISO-IEC-8859-1

[08:04](#msg62f4b7ff72ad51741f0ffd70)Position keeping is on of the most important aspects of a GUI System. When moving from the main window to a child one, and the back, you expect to find text/icons/lists/the cursor where you have left it. Changing their position, confuses the brain as it has to reseek for elements as it looses track of them or has to reposition everything as before. When you open an editor, it is fantastic to find the cursor where you have made the last edit; when you delete a line in a list, it is a breeze when you to not have to reseek for the deletion position; when you reopen a program, having the same windows and document is very helpful. This because the most of the time, you continue working on something than doing something new. (Obviously, there are exception to this rule)

[08:04](#msg62f4b80af4d7a323de0492bf)Why I write this?

[08:08](#msg62f4b9176837563d1c05afff)Because I have recently faced some very good apps, which have totally frustrated me to the point I have discarded them. One was a photo editor which depict filters groups as images.

[08:11](#msg62f4b9acaa091774293e5edd)The same is happening using Facebook on mobile, when you unexpectedly find it has refreshed and restarted. Also Google keep forces me to reopen the last note and go to the bottom of it, because it does not save the last position.

[08:16](#msg62f4bace6837563d1c05bdf6)The whole world is moving toward maintaining the user working session accross sites, computer, devices. So if we want to have a gui system suitable for the modern world, having it capable of giving to the developer a way to get the last position and restart from it, is really important.

GiuseppeChillemi

[08:24](#msg62f4bcb405ad4a370120e1fb)@rebolek Boleslav, other than switching a character, it would be important to know the event of having an unsupported char has happened.

[08:33](#msg62f4beddaa091774293e863d)@hiiamboris There are things, as a developer, that could not let you implement "position keeping". If in a text area you can't get the current cursor position and offset from the top and set it via code, you do not have the instruments to reposition the text. The same applies in lists and anything which has scrollable parts. @toomasv has kindly listened to this request on text-list and now we have code for text areas cursor too.

I mean e.g. you set `data` by default in your style to some `[a b c]` list. If it appended, not overridden, how would user remove that default data? It makes sense to override.

luce80

hiiamboris

[18:30](#msg630a62c4d020d223d305c607)That's because whole `options` facet gets overridden. Same as `data` or `text` would.

No, you can't create `event!`s, but `actors` object is yours to add functions and then call them.

You can \[send a message](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-sendmessage) to own window, or simulate an OS event using \[mouse\_event](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-mouse\_event). And something like that on other platforms.

[20:34](#msg632b755a647d633cf630b53d)&gt; In fact I was trying to redefine it using rich-text. But I see that if I do not specify a transparent color I get a left aligned text and if I make one with transparent background I get a centered text.

Use `face/para` to control the alignment.

[21:11](#msg632b7e126837563d1ce5e0c4)&gt; Is visible? implemented for a scrollable scroller ?

[18:36](#msg632cab3711a6a83d04c97983)Wouldn't it be nice if `paren!`s inside VID "layouting" blocks were evaluated automatically without having to use `compose` ?

greggirwin

[19:35](#msg632cb911443b7927a7283da0)Some parens are evaluated. e.g. `view [button "Extra! Extra!" [print mold face/extra] extra (1 + 2 + 3)]`

This request comes up from time to time, and may seem obvious to do. But then we have to ask how much it helps, or if you're better off building your dynamic layouts another way. The simple cases, like caption/text replacement, still need a way to refer to the config'd text, which works today.

```
s: "Extra! Extra!"
view [button s [print mold face/extra] extra (1 + 2  + 3)]
```

But not if your word is in an object, because paths don't evaluate automatically like words there.

We could set up a page like \[this one](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BHOWTO%5D-VID-and-View-(GUI)-hints-and-tips) but for VID design ideas.

I have understood but is there a way to tell VID "Draw it at the bottom of this button", or "add this button to the panel and recalculate and reposition everything? I mean a method that does not imply feeding VID the entire description again?

## Friday 23th September, 2022

toomasv

[03:43](#msg632d2b4a6837563d1ce916bf)@GiuseppeChillemi Yes, there is, but you have to be pretty specific about where to put it.

&gt; Draw it at the bottom of this button

You have several options to do this. May-be closest to your example:

```
view [
    p: panel 300x150 [
        x: button "hello" [
			append p/pane layout/only compose [
				at (as-pair x/offset/x x/offset/y + x/size/y + 10)
				button "world" with [
				][probe reduce [x/offset face/offset]]
]]]]
```

Or

```
view [
    p: panel 300x150 [
        x: button "hello" [
			append p/pane make-face/offset/spec 'button 
				as-pair x/offset/x x/offset/y + x/size/y + 10 [
					"world" [probe reduce [x/offset face/offset]]
				]
]]]
```

This is if you wanted to add it below. Try positioning it across.

&gt; add this button to the panel and recalculate and reposition everything

I assume you mean inserting here. Again, you have to do calculations, if you are not going to feed the whole layout to `layout` again. E.g.

```
view [
    p: panel 300x150 [
        x: button "hello" [
			insert p/pane make-face/offset/spec 'button x/offset [
				"world" [probe reduce [x/offset face/offset]]
			]
			x/offset/y: face/offset/y + face/size/y + 10
]]]
```

[04:03](#msg632d3022cf6cfd27afa0f0f6)Gosh, I don't know what the `with []` is doing in first example :flushed: I probably tried first to give offset to the new button with `with [offset: ...]` but it didn't work.

`size-text` returns the mininum text sizes. What do you expect for the max text sizes? Infinite?

How is that possible? For example, you have set the /size facet to 200x200, then you set the /text facet. How does Red know if you want to reset /size according to the /text or not?

That is the thing I don't know ;) . Here I am talking about aesthetics.

&gt; How is that possible?

Yes, not possible. But there are a number of possibilities, none is the \*right* one but some could be better then others. provided the there is choice to change things.  
P.S. about aesthetics: I would modify that function a bit. I would delete `origin 0x0` and probably reduce emoji `font-size` a bit.

&gt; Entire frameworks, applications, and companies have been built on that.

However, it is far easier to bind a dynamic block to a temporary context, with all the structures and values, than:

```
make make object! compose/deep/only...
```

Because you also have blocks with `compose/deep/only`, so you create from an object proto which has also `make make object! compose/deep/only...`, and your brain become nuts going back and forth inside the script, trying to read and understand how all the structures works.

[21:53](#msg633b59f664f29419bfc0b079)In this case, it would be great if you have a single block with everything inside and you can selectively compose parens, telling Red which one to use. So you may compose some deeper blocks, then some other and then up to the root level.

[00:02](#msg6353332821df5f7a54b16089)I don't think we need new syntax. e.g. the old `build/inject` alternative idea to compose gives you more control.

In R2 list, there was only ever a single "current" item being drawn. The model made it hard to implement anything but display+action-only lists. e.g. it built the sub-layout based on an index, and you could create a link/action that was fixed, based on a block of data. But if you showed multiple items (the point of a list), things like `field` or `check/radio` didn't work. It was a nice foundation, but incomplete for real world needs.

luce80

[08:51](#msg6353af040a8c6e22a1d3f3c2)&gt;things like `field` or `check/radio` didn't work

Uh! Yes it seems so, now that I've tested it. Funny that with my `vid1r3.r3` it works ...

&gt;What would be the point of an action block if there are two buttons?

I am trying to make a spinner. And there is always a point in an action block.

&gt; A mechanism for creating groups or templates and combining them doesn't exist today,

There should be or how do you create complex `style`s from simple ones ?

&gt;beyond `compose` or building the layout incrementally.

When you have built the layout how do you control it from an implementer POV and from a user POV ?

hiiamboris

[09:25](#msg6353b713880fe76caa07dbca)@greggirwin `build/inject` is still new syntax (to Red), just \*\*much\** less thought out.

[09:30](#msg6353b832cd9a8436d12b5085)@luce it's beyond `style` scope. You can control your layout if you declared your own template.

luce80

[12:33](#msg6353e305f00b697fec533dd1)I shoul have not used the word `style` that is ambiguous, I shoud have used "widget", but what I meant is that I can not use this:

```

	default-actor: on-down
	template: [
		type: 'panel
		size: 0x0 ;@@ declared to avoid BUG

	init: [

		face/pane: pane/pane
		face/size: pane/size
	]
]

view [spinner 30 [Print "hi"]] ;@ cannot use action
```

And this does not work:

```
view make face! [
	type: 'window

[14:29](#msg6353fe31aa210536d6229f29)ez fix: `view [spinner 30 on-click [Print "hi"]]`  
`layout` uses block for panel's pane, it's hardcoded in current design  
But I'll return to my question, what's even the point? You're about to assign the \*same* action to two buttons.

[14:32](#msg6353ff0421df5f7a54b2bb28)&gt; And this does not work

You forgot offsets, and `base` is a D2D surface, it cannot support native controls

luce80

[16:00](#msg6354139f88e38704c023845e)The fix is a kind of a "documentation" fix. The idea was to "intercept" the click and "dispatch" the action based on the clicked button, and/or something similar to the buttons of a scroller which can have an action block.  
In the example there is only one offset which is enough if the `base` is changed with a `panel`.  
I could ask you what is a D2D surface but I think that would be too much ;)

hiiamboris

[16:04](#msg635414a888e38704c02385cd)Direct2D is a hardware-accelerated vector rendering technology, which has nothing to do with the native GUI widgets coming since pre-Windows-95 era. You can draw native widgets \*over* it (expect flicker), but not \*inside* (by the means of) D2D surface.

[16:07](#msg6354155227f328266d4f1774)You seem to be trying to hack the design past it's designed limits with your dispatch based on the button idea. I suggest either using `data` facet to provide data to your style, then let the style pick relevant actors from there, or like I proposed previously, make a dialect extending VID.

luce80

[16:20](#msg6354183c0a8c6e22a1d4adf9)When you talk about extending VID do you mean something like `view my-extending-vid-function [spinner [print data]]` ?

hiiamboris

[16:22](#msg635418aca3ccb16cbe1e17b9)Yeah, or `my-view [spinner [print data]]`

greggirwin

[18:30](#msg635436b5a3ccb16cbe1e4e27) I understand your goal now @luce80. Thanks for clarifying. There are two thoughts here.

1\) a reusable compound widget should encapsulate details and hide information. So the user doesn't control the individual actions of the inner buttons. This leads to complications if you want a single style to both handle numeric spinning and list-of-data selection.

2\) R2 provided more control with its `words` handling in style definitions. That was important because it didn't use native controls, so everything was built using that. Red's VID doesn't have that, so you're limited in what you can expose in a compound style anyway.

Which leads back to the other solutions we're discussing.

luce80

[07:52](#msg6354f2d086407c265b86be88)IMHO having the possibility to create a compound widget using already implemented native controls could be a way to extend the number of available widgets in a relatively simple way. Otherwise I must recreate even a simple button from scratch also drawing it using `draw` in a non system-GUI compatible way. But I am not as skilled as @hiiamboris ;) , should I go to his side anyway and/or wait for him to implement the widgets I need or like ? Perhaps its time to try his VID/S ;)

[10:48](#msg635e567eaa210536d635d83a)@luce80 It should be `pen off` instead of `fill-pen off` (which has no effect there, as there's no filling pen defined previously). Over than that, it seems there's only one bug there: the second arc's center location seems affected by the first arc.

[10:52](#msg635e578b9ee3ec22b4e86815)Looks like the culprit is the arc's sweep argument.

[12:47](#msg635e72735b0dbc04b8a9abf0)In the above reactive formula you could have leveraged the `/text` and `/data` auto-convert feature to simplify the code:

```
react [face/data: to 1 s/data * 1200 - 400]
react [face/data: to 1 e/data * 1200 - 400]

You should specify the `starting point` and the `ending point` of the linear pen. For now the draw engine is not yet able to figure them out for `arc`.

Can you elaborate on how those are related?

hiiamboris

[11:00](#msg636a36ca4fee72663c66b994)Indexes mean whole chars, e.g. 7x7 is a single 7-th character, and there's no way to denote an empty interval (which a caret is) using index notation. While pair offsets (that are zero-based) represent ranges and 7x7 means start after 7 chars and end after 7 chars, which is an empty interval (a caret). 0x0 is a valid caret location, after 0 chars.

[11:01](#msg636a370aff5546644b35c293)AFAIK OSes all use offset notation. In Red we fight designs taken by the OSes to come up with a more limited and less convenient design (IMO :)

[11:14](#msg636a39f925ca105c88a7d14f)If we add /caret facet, it can only be offset-based, and if /selected is index-based, they won't align with each other, leading to awkward math needed for such a simple thing.

[11:15](#msg636a3a3b473cf96648d70a91)But since most GUI systems don't support /caret separate from /selected (selection always ends at caret), they unify it into one logical parameter.

[12:05](#msg636a45fa426f9311ff95e9a2)Alternatively, /caret can include both char index and a flag whether it is located before that char or after it. It makes some sense for wrapped text: caret with the same offset can map to end of the previous or to beginning of the next line, will act the same but will be displayed differently (otherwise you may click on beginning of the next line and see caret at the end of the previous, or vice versa). This will however obviously complicate working with it, for very ephemeral value.

[12:10](#msg636a4724655bc46025b9711f)I am also of an opinion that an integer range! datatype should be used for selection, not a pair (which has a 2D meaning, and is going to support floats hopefully). Then `empty? selection` would naturally map to it, as well as `length? selection`.

luce80

[18:29](#msg636aa01325ca105c88a8a40d)@dockimbel : @hiiamboris already explained it. I can only add 2 things: pixels are 0-based so there is a precedent; the alternative proposed was using `/y = 0` as a kind of escaping number so 7x7 still means a single 7-th character but 7x0 means an empty selection starting after 7-th character and representing the caret position. I do not know if the 2nd alternative is easily implemented and/or simple to "understand" by the user, you choose.

I also hope to read your design notes sometime soon.

## Wednesday 9th November, 2022

luce80

[19:04](#msg636bf9ae326f06602c3f29ff)Just a second thought: 7x0 could mean an empty selection starting before 7-th character so 1-based remains and we could have it before `range!` is implemented and you still could possibly change it when View is revisited. Currently I could find a (cumbersome) workaround to get the caret position but no way to set it.

greggirwin

[22:09](#msg636c2508426f9311ff998548)We can think further outside this box and make selection a structure, e.g. a block. Then we can also name values. But first we should define an interface for dealing with selections via wrappers. That may be enough.

Why not just use `integer!` values?

luce80

[18:49](#msg636e9937bcdb0060b8194141)`integer!` is better ! I simply thought we had to stay "compatible" with current format. I just tried and for 0-based selection indeed this works moving the caret:

```
select-text: func [
	hWnd   [handle!]
	values [red-value!]
	/local
		sel		[red-pair!]
		begin	[integer!]
		end		[integer!]
][
	sel: as red-pair! values + FACE_OBJ_SELECTED
	either TYPE_OF(sel) = TYPE_PAIR [
		begin: sel/x
		end: sel/y									;
	][
		begin: 0
		end:   0

	SendMessage hWnd EM_SETSEL begin end

```

Although it is not "adjusted" for newlines...

hiiamboris

[19:10](#msg636e9e41a34b51121127c67e)Caret and selection exist together. When you press Left or Right or Shift+Left or Shift+Right the caret moves or selection extends/contracts from the previous caret position.

[19:16](#msg636e9f99f9491f62c9ac5c55)That was the reason why I thought that `selected` `pair!`should be used, but probably `integer!` could solve and/or simplify things even more.

I belived you have studied most of the Redbol past GUI efforts, but IIRC I also saw your mention about exposing "keywords"? So just a note - not sure it was Carl's R3 GUI effort, but I do remember:

\- facet - shared property across instantiated "objects"  
\- faced - private copy to the created object (not shared)  
\- options - block, which defined keywords for the VID level ....

[09:17](#msg6379f09025ca105c88c4cf7d)To like or dislike something in the codebase you first have to understand it ;) So no, I don't accept style complaints there.

[09:49](#msg6379f81b0513b562e8bb9a86)Visual code representation might be imo a valid argument, as it might influence how users perceive the system and might influence they likes/dislikes to use any such system.

[09:53](#msg6379f906655bc46025d6250e)As for the past Rebol experience - in Rebol, subobjects are shared. During the old VID times, users were manipulating the face elements directly, and wondering, why changing a button to red color changed all of them :-) `faced`simply allowed to define a private instance element at a style level, IIRC. `options`allowed to define exposed keywords to the VID level, so that you could use `my-style color red`, where `color`was an exposed keyword.

hiiamboris

[09:59](#msg6379fa822cb657024036b46b)I see, thanks. So R2 VID was much more configurable than Red VID.

pekr

[10:06](#msg6379fc1325ca105c88c4e431)It is always a tough call between the native gui vs non-native one :-) During the old R2 VID times (1996 or 1998 was first View 1.0 release) we have complained, that apps might get refused, as we did not have the ability to have elements like menu, context menu, reflect OS native styling.

The perceptions changed with the iPhone revolution imo. Amiga like big buttons were not a problem anymore :-) With Red, we've got native UI integration. I like the menu, buttons, find it sufficient .... till you don't want to use more sophisticated elements like Grid, for which you simply will not be able to find a cross-platform element.

The problem of past VID was also its incompletness. Carl told us, that it was just his attempt to show a way, and expected community to bring in more sophisticated GUIs on top of View. The situation was also improved later with the AGG library integrations, so Draw got much more powerfull capabilities.

[10:09](#msg6379fcd315a3885c70fcaa57)The problem of past VID was its simplicity - no rich-text, insufficient keyboard support, OS non compatible tabbing, etc. It can be done, but needs more complex set-up, and that's what I can see with Spaces.

Btw - when Amiga was for sale, Carl worked for a Viscorp company, which wanted to buy an Amiga for their set-top-box business. Was interviewing him for Amiga Review and asked about Amiga GUI.

[15:40](#msg6392057507ac190597e2f979)There are 2 bad things. Tab-panel has red background and has 2 sub-`panel`s. 1st panel is "post"-colored green (since it cannot be colored by `VID`), then tab-panel is enlarged and 1st sub-`panel` is enlarged less. The idea was to be able to distinguish among tab-panel, 1st sub-panel and its `base` content. Hoping that I can fill the sub-panel I enlarge the base to have the size of its parent panel but nothing seem to happen but at a second try it and its pane get the size of the tab-panel !

[15:47](#msg63920725865cc926ae4f961b)I remember that the panels in a tab-panel should be auto-sized to fit the whole widget dimensions, though I don't remember where we do that. Anyway, you should not try to change the size of those background panels, as they are part of the widget. They are there to provide a container and a background for each tab. Ah found the \[place](https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/modules/view/backends/windows/tab-panel.reds#L221) where the auto-sizing happens.

[15:55](#msg639209022b937b1a2eb01959)The auto-sizing seems to happen too late, otherwise I wouldn't try to change the size myself :)

hiiamboris

[15:57](#msg6392095d0c89e71a336cf2ca)So my hypothesis about the unwanted spacing above:  
\- VID assigns panel and tab-panel size according to it's own `svm/paddings` value and content size  
\- View changes panel size upon rendering to the real non-client metrics reported by the OS (which will be font-dependent too)  
\- the discrepancy between the two results in the unwanted spacing and asymmetry

[16:03](#msg63920acdb9b687534185b03f)I suppose catch-22 is that VID doesn't yet show anything, but OS won't let you know the metrics until you do show it.

[16:06](#msg63920b7c865cc926ae4f9e53)The issue seems to be with this line: `tb/size/x: tb/size/x + 200`.

[16:00](#msg6399f33bb9b6875341948280)@ldci actually my problem is very simple : I have 2 bits image of scans with surrounding white but not necessary clean, with some black pixels of noise. I want to make a new image computed from the boundary box of the scan, and it was working well in rebol. Your library is very complete, is there a bounding box function in redcv ? thanks

[16:12](#msg6399f5eca1ba3e75d8f8996c)@Oldes saving an image is not a problem. it is to make an image from a box that uses draw that is a problem in red. probing imgbox gives none to imgbox/image and /parent/pane/image contains the original image, not the resized one. imgbox/size gives me the correct size, but no image of the drawn imgbox seems to be created. my question is : how do I get an image of what is displayed in the window or the box with the draw \[image ...] command ?

[16:12](#msg6399f605865cc926ae5e6298)@oldes again, it worked perfectly well in rebol.

[16:16](#msg6399f6e9dbde086250e2a268)I would advise against saving what is displayed on the GUI face, as it is likely going to be scaled/distorted.

[16:16](#msg6399f6fb4a6ed5138358c5f3)Just use the `draw` standalone function.

[17:06](#msg639a027e0c89e71a337be66e)@ldci wow, I'm onto something. when using the save button it works perfectly on my program, but if the window is closed img/image returns none. Is it something normal or is it a bug ? because in this program in rebol I never displayed a view, everything in rebol happened in the layout. With red it seems I have to display the view and save inside the vied. Is there a way to avoid that because I have hundreds of thousand of images (scans of pages of tibetan text) to compute ? thks

[17:39](#msg639a0a618bdea01368b6cc90)@guibus if you just need to crop an image, you may use `copy/part`:

```
img: make image! 100x100
copy/part at img 2x2 20x20 ;; will create an image of size 20x20 from the original position 2x2

Please take care with Red if you are LOADing more than a few thousand images.....Red has no real garbage collection for images and (being still 32-bit) can rapidly run out of memory.

For the time being, you may want to shell-out to Rebol code to tweak the images.

The code below is an example of a failure:

```
unview/all
im-1: make image! view/no-wait compose [box 500x500 red (copy/part mold system 1200)]
save/as %im-1.png im-1 'png
im-2: make image! view/no-wait compose [box 500x500 blue (copy/part mold system 1200)]
save/as %im-2.png im-1 'png

unview/all
view/no-wait [ib: image 500x500]

   print n

\- It would be nice to have a `find-window` function. It's very easy to implement and quite handy at times.  
\- `set-focus` does not work on `panel` which I use to make compound widgets, so I can not forward `on-focus` to a sub-face.  
\- Is this "intended behaviour" ?

greggirwin

[19:20](#msg63ade87bc4fec572d65dc83b)Compound faces are important, but not portable. e.g. Windows ListView isn't available elsewhere, so we do have to roll our own. What we need to do is design a model for how they work, so we can share them.

luce80

[19:39](#msg63adece87de82d261603ad04)I do not mind the OS level, a `panel` is (or not?) a `face` and a `face` should be focusable. I would use a `base` if that provided the same functionality of a `panel`. The OS should not know what I am doing with the `face`just provide key input for whatever it is and continue to use `window/selected`and give `on-focus` and/or keyboard events to it.
