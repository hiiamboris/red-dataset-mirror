[00:02](#msg5a497aacba39a53f1ac0be9e)@greggirwin Yeah, people always want to go the path of least resistance. Learning new things? Wut? üò≤ I never heard of REBOL before, but if I did, I would have been using it, that's for sure. I need high performance code, so REBOL was out of the question, but now Red is here and I don't want to use any of the bloated stuff. I though Haxe and Nim is great, but nothing comes close to the (upcoming) features of Red

[00:03](#msg5a497adbedd2230811fa815c)Happy New Year, everyone!

gour

[07:39](#msg5a49e5c084fb74b9402463ae)@9214 If I do that (iow. choose Racket), the reasons are, I believe, pretty obvious: 64bit support, nice GUI DSL for creating multi-platform desktop apps, excellent docs, decent performance, ability to create (kind of) stand-alone apps, package management, "batteries included", editor support integrated IDE is very nice, but not killer feature, organized community... i understand that most/all of those things are on Red's TODO list, but Racket does provide it today. moreover, Linux in Red is 2nd or 3rd class citizen which sucks a bit.

&gt; @BeardPower what went wrong with Nim for you, just curious?

Nim is a great language and I thought about using it for some TCP server implementation.  
What went "wrong" for me/I don't like:  
\* The python-like indentation: I don't want to be restricted in how my code structure hast to look; one single misplaced space and your code does not work: CR/LF issues because of various platform differences.  
\* It needs a third party C++ compiler: I don't want to install bloat to get my code running.  
\* The lack of an integrated UI: libUI seems to be the route they decided on, but the project is not active since a year; another dependency you have to care for.  
\* The syntax still looks like the others (C++, Java etc.) we used to (unnatural bracket-function style): it does not has this clear, human readable and natural form of REBOL/Red.  
\* Meta-Programming is good, but it still has the feel of some complicated, unnatural style.

gour

[16:49](#msg5a4a66a2232e79134db3848d)@BeardPower thanks.  
\* I played with Haskell and indentation did not bother me. Moreover, I thought that indentation in Nim is not so sensitive as in Python due to NIm's lexical analysis  
\* as far as UI, I was also asking since long time ago to focus more on GUI and provide something. I know about libUI from Go, but I thought that these days there is more focus on \[nimx](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimx)  
\* Red's syntax is really cool and I've a feeling that one can really do a lot with less code  
\* I agree with meta-programming and here I'm more with Racket's style  
Btw, what is your most used platform/OS for Red?

greggirwin

[16:56](#msg5a4a684fedd2230811fdeebd)Great input @gour. Thanks so much. For me, Windows is the main OS I target.

gour

[16:58](#msg5a4a68a9ba39a53f1ac42a6c)\[This](http://sprylang.org/) might be interested for some, although I am not sure how active it is these days.

BeardPower

[17:12](#msg5a4a6bfd5355812e573d0b2d)@gour nimx is not really usable for a project. It's just a PoC.

&gt;Btw, what is your most used platform/OS for Red?

Right now it's Windows, as it has the best UI support right now. Hoping to switch to one of the \*BSDs, once the UI support is mature enough.

gour

[17:13](#msg5a4a6c40b48e8c35668a8e13)Win XP was the last Windows I had license for...BSD? i tried few times to migrate, but now settled on Fedora

BeardPower

[17:16](#msg5a4a6cd6b48e8c35668a9074)@gour Sprylang is also nice, but all these languages come with some weird syntax like

```
'to:do: =
```

. Reading something like this feels so strange to me.

[17:20](#msg5a4a6de6232e79134db3a572)@gour Yes, I like to use an OS as a whole, not something like GNU/Linux, where every distribution out the thousand different ones, is doing it's own thing.  
There is only one FreeBSD, one DragonFlyBSD etc., so I am using DragonFlyBSD and FreeBSD.

If working with GNU/Linux, I'm using Slackware and Arch, but I hope Redox turns out great :)

&gt;have you tried hammer2? i was/am interested for DragonFly on the desktop

Unfortunately not in production use, as I'm using zfs, but it's the real deal from what I experienced so far! DragonFly is really great. Hybrid kernel :smile:

&gt;and if you like OS as a whole, what about Pharo/Smalltalk?

I barely read into it, but it reminds me of ETH-Oberon (Oberon System 4), which I used in my 20ties :smile:  
Such systems are hard to grasp at the beginning and it often boggles your mind. When looking back or when you get it, you really see why they are so great and you really don't want to use anything different than these systems.

[20:44](#msg5a4a9db329ec6ac311a8acd3)Same with REBOL/Red. The more you use it, the more you think about, why you wasted your time with this "other" crap ;-)

[09:38](#msg5a4b533084fb74b9402a4a03)@BeardPower glad to hear you like DfBSD. which DE/WM you use with it? yes, zfs is cool...on linux i gave up on btrfs (using xfs) and zfs is a bit pain to setup. I also have feeling that I could have great experience with Red which could led to question why spending time with "other crap". what do you use Red for? simple utility stuff or do you plan something bigger?

[09:39](#msg5a4b536284fb74b9402a4ab6)i also wonder about Red's FFI...how easy/hard is to call 3rd party C libs or providing Red bindings for them? is there any helper to automate things a bit?

maximvl

[10:13](#msg5a4b5b58ba39a53f1ac802f0)so it's just a library which can change the semantics of the language (which is the power of DSL)

rebolek

[17:52](#msg5a4d1876b48e8c3566973eda)@BillDStrong Red/System should be separate IMO, there are keywords, unlike in Red.

greggirwin

[18:00](#msg5a4d1a450163b02810aab22a)Separate is good in this case, as Red/System is a dialect of Red. Exploring how to identify and highlight dialects will be important going forward.

rebolek

[18:04](#msg5a4d1b3884fb74b9403345e9)It's very easy in case of Red/System. But identifying something like `parse` block would be quite a challenge.

meijeru

[18:18](#msg5a4d1e605355812e5749e4f0)Syntactically, everything inside the block following `Red/System` is in R/S dialect, and so is everthing in the block following `#system` or `#system-global` as well as in the body-block of a `routine`. But the word/path following the `#call` directive and the arguments, if any, of the called Red function are in Red. In the latter case, it might be difficult to know how many those arguments are....

greggirwin

[18:19](#msg5a4d1ea0ba39a53f1ad0fd8f)A challenge, yes, but not impossible. Like many things with Red, it may not be 100% in all cases, because we can do things in so many ways, but you could statically scan for values used as inputs to `parse`. Also useful for standalone tools, where all you are writing is parse rules, e.g., in a Visual Dialect Editor.

[00:15](#msg5a5015336117191e612f127b)@are1000 : crazy to use web technology for desktop app? You have to build you own GUI with HTML / CSS / JS / glue language of you chose in backend and try to imitate rich widgets. You can do it by yourself or use a rich but heavy toolkit with a standard design, or yet compile a lot of external components. At the end you have a big ball of dependencies backed with 4 languages, which once is described by it's author as inherently flawed (JS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_DKkVvOt6dk). This code is really fragile, and not ubiquitous like a website. In fact it's just this mood to imite rich app with web techs which is crazy. Web standards give poor widgets because there are document oriented, your have to emulate them and it's horrible. Browser should implement stylable treeview, listview, panel... and offer a native dual way document / app.

[00:18](#msg5a5015cd5355812e57590d02)I don't agree. I think that the combination of HTML+CSS+JS is really powerful and allows you to do so many beautiful, creative and functional applications.

Red aims to be highly compatible, but also tries to improve things. If you keep notes while you're doing this, about what works and what doesn't, we can start a wiki page for this.

&gt; I want to learn dev-tools of a crypto moneys. So, i want to learn them; send transfer, receive and security with a programming language. I studied iota, but i didn't undertand :/

What exactly? E.g., the IOTA foundation provides a JS API and also a Sandbox, which allow you to interact with the wallet and the Tangle. As it's a REST API, you can also develop in Red.

[16:50](#msg5a63736de0141226506cf420)I meant JS lib. There is also a python lib. The libraries are considered early beta. You can also use curl, node.js etc.

[05:53](#msg5a657c5a5ade18be39a77364)More debugging tools will certainly come. When you find `parse` and start playing with that, you'll see that there may be specific ways to debug in domains as well.

Red's design makes some things very easy, and other things...a little trickier. That is, we can't think of it like we would just any other language. We can play around with `do/next` and think that's all it would take, but there's more to it or, you're right, it would already be there.

9214

[07:20](#msg5a6590a45ade18be39a7d07b)`trace` should be enough IMO, line-by-line stepping ain't really fit (as there no lines, strictly speaking)

endo64

[12:20](#msg5a65d6f398927d57451eb9e9)I remember that there was `trace` flag in 68000 CPU's status register, that when set, stops and calls an exception handler after each instruction that CPU executed, hence it was so easy to debug assembly codes using an monitor/debugger like AsmOne, AsmPro, Trash'mOne or similar, line by line while keeping an eye on the registers and memory.. Lovely days

greggirwin

[13:48](#msg5a65ebc55ade18be39a9f041)I would like to see something like DTrace capabilities, so we can instrument and query.

We have different environments. Languages that are purely interpreted or purely compiled can look at things only one way. Red has to look at things in both ways, as a start. And then we should step back for a moment and ask if a step debugger is what we really want. If it's easy, and doesn't conflict with anything else, sure. It will make people comfortable, and we can limit its features to keep it simple. e.g., in some langs you can edit code while stopped on a breakpoint, in others you have to restart. In VB it was added later to allow continuing.

dander

[18:59](#msg5a6634a098927d5745212474)I think that for experienced developers, tracing/instrumentation is likely enough, but for people who are exploring/learning, there are huge gains to shortening the test/observe cycle as much as possible. I think that going as far as we can toward live-coding could be a killer feature of Red. I think there are some overlaps with that and a debugger (the edit and continue feature). Sometimes it's hard to understand what's going on without being able to explore the state of an application, so the ability to pause and step can be very useful, but it's hard to say how essential it is without the other parts in place. I do think many people would expect it, but that doesn't mean they \_need_ it.

greggirwin

[19:44](#msg5a663f055a9ebe4f75be3ff4)Right, and we can provide tools that cover a lot of basic use cases, which may not work for gurus doing dynamic binding, but are fine for people using it like they would VB.

Let me tell you a story about a little language that could.  
Once upon a time, deep deep in the bloatware swamp, there was a little language that could. He was interpreting his way across all the &gt;1MB mess... `bind` `bind`, `parse` `parse`. This little languages' mission was to take some DSLs and a homoiconic pay`load`, over the mountain to the `1.0` release. Needless to say, there was plenty of opposition! You think that stopped the little language that could? No siree bob. He just kept interpreting along...`bind` `bind`, `parse` `parse`. Not even when they climbed aboard the issue tracker and breeded all kinds of bugs, and hacktoberfest and sleepless nights with gdb were drippin out of Fullstack office windows. Think that stopped the language that could? Damn skippy... he just kept interpreting along... `bind` `bind`, `parse` `parse`...

Wasn't until @dockimbel rigged the roadmap with blockchain announcement as the little language was making his way across the `0.6.3`. :boom: ...an `ICO`splosion happened! And tears of joy, and happiness, and praising, and :rainbow: was everywhere. @greggirwin come crawling out the back with both ICO rounds missing. VB community's baby boy, and he looked up and me and he said," @9214 I can't feel my REDs!." And I said," @greggirwin , \*\*they aint there\*\*." And I looked down and ICO website's little red bar was all at 0. And I said," @greggirwin , its 4 major releases to the nearest Linux GUI support, and unless you can fix the #3156 you aint gonna make it!" All of the sudden, newcomers were all over the place. Just me and my REPL, and I had no other alternative, but to help everyone...

Such fast compilation mode also works for Red scripts that embed Red/System code. Two cases are possible:  
1\. Red/System code does not contain any call to Red runtime library.  
2\. Red/System code contains one or several calls to Red runtime library.

In the first case, nothing needs to be done, the usage rules described above apply.

In the second case, a custom version of libRedRT is required, but the toolchain will take care of the process, it just requires the user to compile once using -u option, then simply use -c for next compilations. If new functions from the runtime library are called, then a new custom library needs to be rebuilt.

When compiling a custom run-time library, cleaning libRedRT files is needed to get rid of any outdated versions. The toolchain provides a red clear command which will remove all current libRedRT related files. Note that when upgrading the red binary to a newer version, it will automatically upgrade libRedRT on first invocation.

Any Red user code can be compiled in development mode, with the exception of objects with multiple inheritance, which is not supported by libRedRT (so can only be compiled in release mode).

[20:04](#msg5a7767644a6b0dd32b8af785)Or start with the most basic things and work up to where you hit a problem. e.g., can you compile OK without any SQLite involved?

[20:10](#msg5a7768b6ac509d207dba128d)@viayuve, I suggest that you spend some time learning more Red fundamentals. I know you're anxious to dive into things, but it will help you go faster if you start small, build confidence and understanding about the basics, then add pieces. It will also help people answer your questions more effectively, because they'll be more focused.

About learning basics I am doing it in my spare time. About err I am getting it with sqlite only, without library most program are working fine(I only tried sqlite lib because I needed it to integrate in my work about other libs I dunno ). Some GUI does produce strange output even with single click on it. I do ask lot of questions because it produces better outcome for me.

[00:59](#msg5a7a4f6586ef1bb14179099b)@9214 I have no idea how to fix it. :sweat\_smile: I saw those warnings before.

The GTK+ backend is currently behind Android Support, Full I/O, Modules. CG and Concurrency in the pre-ICO roadmap. The roadmap has yet to be adjusted to fit in the Red/CCC dialect.

[17:35](#msg5a7c8a77ce68c3bc7460b306)Rebol used AGG internally, and used all its own styles rather than native widgets. Pros and cons. I imagine we'll see something like that for Red in the future as well, but it's not on the roadmap at this time. And the reason Linux GUI hasn't been a priority is because it wasn't deemed valuable from a business perspective. At least not as much as other features.

rebolek

[18:01](#msg5a7c906c93be87284d91ec8b)Rebol used AGG internally only after 2005 (View 1.2 or 1.3 I believe), just to be precise.

Unfortunately it was a terrible decision to hardwire Rebol's GUI stuff to software rendering. Part of the reason I'm writing my own stuff using OpenGL acceleration from the get go. I may still use the API design for inspiration in some cases, mainly because I'm still not a real Rebol/Redlang programmer, more of a pragmatic tourist at this time.

rebolek

[20:05](#msg5a7cad787dcd63481f3618f8)@htrob in the hindsight you're right, but 13 years ago the situation was different. Original Rebol graphics was extremely slow and AGG was huge improvement (as I mentioned, by factor of 10) and it was small enough to bundle it with Rebol. Also state of 3D APIs at that time was bit different from today. Cyphre had OpenGL version of Rebol later, but that was never released because R3 somehow died.

haiitch

[20:11](#msg5a7caef97084124a3452e3c2)@rebolek I know. I don't mean to be critical of Rebol, but trying to see how things can be made better. You can't make things better if you convince yourself that everything is fine and every design decision was right. You're telling this to someone who made the exact same mistakes. But the experience was useful because not everything is easily accelerated using OpenGL anyway.

[22:09](#msg5a7f6d98b3c4a0d376086aca)What has mostly been discussed is the actor model, but that doesn't rule out other concurrency schemes. The fact that Red's strong suit is working on series maens there is a lot of room for many types of concurrency.

greggirwin

[22:46](#msg5a7f764cb3c4a0d376088e19)@gour, I imagine we'll see (as @BillDStrong says) more than one model implemented over time. The important thing is finding an underlying model that can be used to build all the others, for leverage. Since the reactive model in Red is a dataflow model, and actors are intended to help with coordination, those ideas could influence the core elements as well.

[12:11](#msg5a84277ace68c3bc748598de)in general, would you expect that the compiler will behave differently to interpreter ? or is the goal that what runs in the console should also compile ?

DideC

[13:21](#msg5a8437bd93be87284db7268d)Rebol was said to be "not compilable" by his creator (Carl S.).  
Dockimbel prove thats its not undoable, but there is some parts that can't be compiled at all (generated code) so must be interpreted by the executable. `layout` is one case where the code is generated (convert "VID" dialect to faces, and their accessors are generated funcs), so the compiler can't pick your `libfile:` word as a variable, cause its just data at the compile time. Then you have to "declare" it manually before.

9214

[16:16](#msg5a8460e5d74ee9f50dc41c94)@guraaku the goal is that both interpreted and compiled behavior should be the same, but Red is too dynamic in its nature to be fully compiled to machine code, and, as @DideC said, some parts should be interpreted.

Current compiler was designed for bootstrapping phase specifically and isn't feature complete. As I understand, JIT compilation and new stack model (dyn-stack ?) will mitigate most of compiling issues in the future. For now we have experimental encapping mode, which, instead of compiling script down to machine code, wraps it up in Redbin format (if I'm not mistaken) and interprets it on launch as calls to runtime.

[16:17](#msg5a8461105cc18726453b696e)I'm out of my league with technical details, @greggirwin should pop up here soon and hopefully he'll explain that part in a more detail

[17:16](#msg5a846ef3f283b8e5466006c0)&gt; in general, would you expect that the compiler will behave differently to interpreter ? or is the goal that what runs in the console should also compile ?

@guraaku the goal is to have the same behavior, but we can do all kinds of funky things in Red that may be tricky for the compiler to handle, hence, `-e` mode makes a single EXE, but interprets everything internally. As you find things that don't compile, or don't work when compiled, see if there's a ticket and make one if not. That's helpful, because even if they take time to fix, people know what to expect.

[17:18](#msg5a846f5dce68c3bc7487828a)I don't know that I can add more details to what @DideC and @9214 said already. But, chances are, you will be able to \*do* everything you want and have it work the same, your code may just not be as idiomatically Red, or dense. :^)

[17:21](#msg5a847010b3c4a0d376226b19)On production readiness, we don't have GC, but that will come soon. Lack of full I/O limits some things too. Other than that, if your code works, you're probably in OK shape. For things like dev tools and code generators, there is virtually no risk, unless you're doing it via some webhook and given user input. But even there, the risks of a bug affecting things are probably equal between you and Red.

BeardPower

[13:58](#msg5a8c298f6f8b4b99469aceb6)@viayuve Yes, R/S is compiled to native code and you have to do memory management yourself. But even in C, it is not possible to write a kernel 100% in C.

rebolek

[14:01](#msg5a8c2a568f1c77ef3a3013fc)That depends how deep you want to dive. You need to write dialect that would output stuff R/S can't.

[14:23](#msg5a8c2f47a2194eb80d8c172d)@BeardPower I read somewhere micro-kernel is no good that is why major linux distro uses monolithic kernel.

BeardPower

[14:23](#msg5a8c2f5e888332ee3aaacb68)@viayuve Documentation is very sparse, because Red is still in Alpha. Rebol has more documentation on that.

viayuve

[14:26](#msg5a8c302d888332ee3aaad0a2)rebol is dead lang or is it still running.

BeardPower

[14:27](#msg5a8c303f53c1dbb74352aedb)@viayuve Well, this is mostly not true. A micro-kernel is using IPC to communicate with the privileged servers. There was a lot of research in making IPC really fast. SEL4/L4 is an example of that. To make it faster, you can use a hybrid approach, running some privileged code in the kernel, like a monolithic kernel does.  
The Mill architecture would be great for a micro-kernel, as there is no task switching and IPC involved, as it communicates through portals.

If you really want performance and flexibility, use an exo-kernel.

[14:28](#msg5a8c3084a2194eb80d8c20f9)Rebol is still running, as it's now open source. E.g. Rebol v3. But @greggirwin could give you the best information on that one.

[15:07](#msg5a8c39be35dd17022ecdb0b4)As you might know, Rebol was created by Carl Sassenrath, which was also creating the kernel for the Commodore AmigaOS.

[15:11](#msg5a8c3a9b6f8b4b99469b546e)Rebol is an interpreted language. Red is Rebol on steroids, as its also possible to compile to native code.

\- Rebol2 is a closed, now frozen language.

\- Red is highly Rebol compatible, but not 100%.  
\- I love microkernels, as I am almost always willing to trade performance for clean design.  
\- Red emits machine language directly, so no ASM layer. In that sense, it \*could* emit anything, as others said. Just not a priority today. If you look at how it works, and I know Nenad has ideas for the V2 design, thinking of your output as data is a powerful model. ASM does that too.  
\- I want to see more language examples in Red, and would also love to see a Forth approach. Rebol1 was written in Scheme, and I think it would be cool to look in both directions. How would you implement Red in Forth, Scheme, etc., and how would you implement Forth, Scheme, etc. in Red?

[10:54](#msg5a8d4fec6f8b4b9946a1585b)I just finished watching every video and reading the papers on the new Mill architecture. If it can keep its promises, the big boys will be toast. It's hardware is designed for micro-kernels, super fast IPC, no context switches, hardware sandboxing, hardware threads... just WOW. It would definitely be the architecture for a new Amiga, running an OS in Red üòâ Their roadmap is "in sync" with Red, which means, that once Red 1.0 is released, there will be hardware. They are also searching for partners. Could this be a perfect opportunity? üòéü§ì

[15:17](#msg5a903094c3c5f8b90df6d854)There is some memory management, interrupt handing etc. needed, so you need a facility, which takes care of that. Embedded devices don't even have an OS.

BeardPower

[15:19](#msg5a90311d35dd17022ee46b47)The goal for Red is to support Android, but I don't know what actually is doable on it.

[15:23](#msg5a9031d953c1dbb743695da0)Yes, the boot loader will start the kernel/OS. E.g. an exo-kernel, which takes care of interrupts, security and a few other things. The OS is just like another app with it's own memory management, threading, I/O etc. You can even run an app without the OS entirely. So you would need to emit code, which will be tailored to the exo-kernel.

PeterWAWood

[07:38](#msg5a91166e6f8b4b9946b605a0)@viayuve There is a Red/System runtime which is compiled alongside the application code. It includes calls to the host OS (via libc) to load the machine code that it produces.

9214

[07:38](#msg5a9116898f1c77ef3a4b3d29)@viayuve you can write compiler for some language in Red that emits assembler, but you can't run Red on bare metal, because Red compiles down to R/S

[07:39](#msg5a9116a0a2194eb80da7b37c)R/S itself relies on syscalls

PeterWAWood

[10:59](#msg5a9145758f1c77ef3a4c0ecf)@viayuve You can get the compiler to output the "pure" machine code of a Red/System program by using the `--no-runtime` option. It will not include the Red runtime so you can't use `print` in the program. (You would need to write your own input and output routines).

Certainly you could compile a simple program such as:

```
Red/System
a: 1
b: 2
c: a + b
```

[10:59](#msg5a9145a46f8b4b9946b6cd38)I haven't done it myself but I believe the format of the machine code will be determined by the `-t` option.

[11:05](#msg5a9146df53c1dbb7436e98bf)The purpose of the `--no-runtime` option is to allow the production of "OS free" executables.

If I remember correctly, it was introduced when Nenad used to take one day off a week from concentrating on Red to enjoy experimenting. He experimented a little with compiling for Arduino.

He's been working on Red 7 days a week almost continuously for the last six years. So he hasn't had time to experiment.

[11:18](#msg5a9149fa35dd17022ee9c469)@viayuve It looks as though the `-no-runtime` option has not kept up with changes made to the compiler since it was introduced. It exposes a compiler error:

BeardPower

[11:44](#msg5a915020888332ee3ac6c276)@viayuve I'm sorry, if there was some misunderstanding in my posts. There is machine code (Hexdump) and Assembler. Red is compiled to R/S which in turn spits out hex (machine code). To run Red on bare-metal, you would need to emit code, which can run on bare metal. This will of course slice of huge parts and features of Red, as Red and in consequence R/S relies on, as pointed out by others, syscalls and libc. That's why you need to spit out assembler to rewire/strip off this code. You cannot create an OS without assembler calls, as you have to do various stuff directly on the CPU. E.g. loading the interrupt description table, setup code segments or communicate with the PIC. These are assembler instructions. Print was mentioned. Normally it's using printf from libc, which is using a system call to the OS, which in turn writes out to the video memory directly. So you would need to implement Print as a direct write to the video memory. Therefore you would need to emit it (change in the compiler/target). If you change this for everything, which is relying on syscalls, Red would run on bare metal.

Joking aside, using Red however it works for you is fine. It took me a while to start using `parse`, and even longer to get some of the deep insights that make Redbol langs different. Most important is that you feel free to play and enjoy Red, because things click differently in every brain, and every experiment you perform will teach you something. We're all too happy to offer excessive advice and overload you with suggestions.

[05:53](#msg5a98e6e4e4ff28713ae3fb17)@guraaku macros are fine as long as you don't compile the script, but after that (i.e. after compilation) they are limited to R2 functionality, since current compiler is bootstrapped from Rebol

[05:57](#msg5a98e7d2458cbde557e627e0)as others have pointed out already, creating `op!` is the easiest way to go, albeit slightly limited:

greggirwin

[07:43](#msg5a9900980202dc012ea170ae)@guraaku, you'll find some of us almost abuse `parse` for every purpose, hence my lighthearted comment. What we need to remember is exactly the approach you're taking now. Let Red do all the work it can, and mold it as lightly as possible for your needs. You're on track.

DVL333

[21:45](#msg5a99c605458cbde557eb161e)Some questions:  
1\) What is the difference between `pair!` and `point!` datatypes? They seem to be similar. Can you give an example of `point!` data, how to define it?  
2\) `handle!` datatype - the same question: Can you give an example `handle!` data, how to define it? There isn't any information about this datatype.  
3\) Is there difference between infix and prefix notations? I mean, I can write `op1 + op2` or `add op1 op2` - what is better to use, or is it the same?

greggirwin

[21:51](#msg5a99c76d8f1c77ef3a76bbf8)`point!` is new, and to be finalized. The idea is that pairs will be limited to 2, possibly integer, values, while points are meant to hold 3, and maybe more, float values. Pairs use `x` notation, while points may use `(1, 2, 3)` notation to match mathematics more closely.

`Handle!` is meant to be an opaque handle for OS interaction. You should only ever need it when storing and passing those at the Red/System or OS API level.

Infix and prefix are effectively the same. Use the one that seems clearest in any given situation. e.g., if you're writing a Lisp dialect, you probably want to use prefix. For most other cases, infix is the norm. But there will always be mixed scenarios as well, where you want to use them to control evaluation precedence. That can be either easier or harder for readers, over parens, and is largely subjective.

DVL333

[23:10](#msg5a99d9cfe4ff28713ae915d6)Hi @9214 :) Thanks for that suggestion, that looks good. The "t o logic!" makes it a much simpler implementation that what I had done

[23:11](#msg5a99da048f1c77ef3a77152d)Oh, and you said, "macros are fine as long as you don't compile the script, but after that (i.e. after compilation) they are limited to R2 functionality, since current compiler is bootstrapped from Rebol"

[23:11](#msg5a99da3d35dd17022e149877)I certainly had intended compilation - but, are you saying, that's the only problem, that they are limited to R2 functionality ? As long I stick to that, compilation should be fine ?

[23:12](#msg5a99da58e4d1c63604b5c60e)Anyway, for now, it seems I'll go the infix operator route - that's what I really wanted in the first place :)

[23:12](#msg5a99da78888332ee3af180f0)So, I'll keep macros in mind if I need them later on...

[23:14](#msg5a99dae1e4d1c63604b5c7eb)@greggirwin , yes, for now my approach of letting Red do as much of the work as it can, means I can implement stuff more quickly - but on the other hand, it leaves open the possibility that malicious users could make use of any Red functionality in an expression, to do anything they want - delete all files or something.

[23:15](#msg5a99db076fba1a703abff576)Whereas if I completely defined my language, they'd only have available the things I make available to them

[23:16](#msg5a99db3553c1dbb7439912ba)I haven't thought too much about it yet, but a couple of approaches that came to mind were -

[23:16](#msg5a99db568f1c77ef3a7719de)have another pass through the code that looked for anything else other than the things I allow

[23:18](#msg5a99dbb235dd17022e149f0c)or, i notice I could set things to none, eg maybe if I didn't want them creating their own GUIs I could do view: none

[23:19](#msg5a99dbeff3f6d24c682db137)but that could be a lot of work, unless there was some way to set all known words to none ?

greggirwin

[23:38](#msg5a99e07b458cbde557eb934b)That's always the tradeoff. Do we let untrusted stuff in, or do more work to lock it down. We don't have the `secure` dialect in place in Red yet, which will help with sandboxing, and I know I personally want to play with some capability-based ideas.

guraaku

[23:47](#msg5a99e29a6fba1a703ac01729)ah, so you're saying there are plans for a secure dialect ?

[23:48](#msg5a99e2de35dd17022e14bbe5)For now, I'm not too worried about it... what I'm doing is really just exploring possibilities

[23:49](#msg5a99e2fcc3c5f8b90d27d1cb)In fact, our current DSL specifically has syntax to allow access to native C# code

[23:49](#msg5a99e31a6f8b4b9946e16c14)so, that kind of security hole courrently exists in our real implementation

[23:50](#msg5a99e3490202dc012ea657fb)Access to C# was put in there in the first place as a quick and dirty means of extending the DSL if needed

[05:14](#msg5a9a2f2253c1dbb7439a389b)@guraaku the rule of thumb is to use macros if you absolutely, positively need to shift heavy computations from run-time to compile-time. There's nothing macros can do that Red cannot, in terms of DSL implementation and homoiconicity. But if you really need them to be compiled, the first step is to make `parse` rules in macros R2-compatible, then you need to ensure that macro transformation works identically both when interpreted and compiled, and it's quite a painful process (I have little experience with that).

guraaku

[05:16](#msg5a9a2fb3c3c5f8b90d28e27c)thanks @9214 , that sounds like a good rule of thumb. :)

9214

[05:21](#msg5a9a30d26f8b4b9946e28212)@DVL333 the difference between `op!` and `function!` is that the former takes \*value* on the left and \*expression* on the right, while the latter takes as many \*expression* as it needs for its arguments (on the right). `op!` have precedence over `function!`s during evaluation, which can be confusing for newcomers. Also, as of now, `op!`s can't accept `'lit-arg` and `:get-arg` syntax. You can think of them as a syntactic sugar over dyadic functions, just don't forget about their precedence and behavior.

[05:48](#msg5a9b88b1c3c5f8b90d2e2e5a)

```
count item in order
```

[05:49](#msg5a9b88cc53c1dbb7439f7d89)I found I can just write a function, count, like

[05:50](#msg5a9b890ef3f6d24c6834341d)

```
count: function [item 'in order] [ ;do stuff...]
```

[05:50](#msg5a9b89166fba1a703ac674f5)then I can call it like

[05:50](#msg5a9b892135dd17022e1b3a65)

```
count x in y
```

[05:51](#msg5a9b89696f8b4b9946e7c856)so for that particular case, where you want your arguments interspersed with "keywords", this is simple

[05:51](#msg5a9b89796fba1a703ac6761f)(so long as your function name isn't something already in use...)

[05:53](#msg5a9b89edc3c5f8b90d2e32ca)so there's nice things in Red that let me write normal Red code, that actually looks like how I want my DSL

[05:54](#msg5a9b8a08c3c5f8b90d2e3336)so I can just do this, without worrying about parse

[05:56](#msg5a9b8a8f8f1c77ef3a7db175)although, defining the function like this also lets me call with with anything in place of "in"

greggirwin

[06:36](#msg5a9b9405c3c5f8b90d2e55ac)Yes, there are all kinds of fun tricks we can use. It's a wonderful tool for thinkering.

[06:38](#msg5a9b94518f1c77ef3a7dd133)If you step back from your code just a bit, you can see how a relatively simple `func` wrapper could take a dialected spec and value check lit-words.

[03:19](#msg5a9e08c6f3f6d24c683fe229)@virtualAlan why should it be?

greggirwin

[04:25](#msg5a9e1835458cbde557fe1233)@virtualAlan, the thing about priorities is...everybody's are different. Since you've worked in the sound area, any contributions you can make would be \*great\*. The catch is that we don't want any external dependencies, yes? So it has to be cross platform, and done with APIs. Starting with one platform is fine, but we also need to define an interface to it at the Red level.

The question for audio is what value it adds. Simple apps do benefit from simple sound playing. If we start there, can we easily extend it later? Games will need much more control, and not all platforms will benefit the same. Mobile games are hot, but Windows games tend to be massive endeavors. Does audio help there without all the other pieces needed?

I think one of the most useful targets is audio creation and editing. Helpful on all platforms, and can then be integrated into other tools and apps.

[01:46](#msg5aa1e78be4d1c63604db7a99)Hi ! now that I've mastered building my DSL with parse etc.... (just kidding !) ... I'm starting to have a look at some GUI stuff

[01:47](#msg5aa1e7cb8f1c77ef3a9c8d10)The vague idea is that I'd like to allow a user to build their own GUI, by dragging and dropping stuff onto the window, eg, buttons, images etc

[01:48](#msg5aa1e7e68f1c77ef3a9c8d32)and then save their final screen so that we can use it later

[01:49](#msg5aa1e82d888332ee3a16f326)So, just experimenting with Layout now. I see that I can define a Layout, and the result is some code making those objects, ie it doesn't save it as the actual Layout code

[01:49](#msg5aa1e841e4ff28713a0e97c5)My simple example,

[01:50](#msg5aa1e8750a1614b712fb50ec)

```
screen: Layout [button "hi there" loose]
```

[01:51](#msg5aa1e89d53c1dbb743be6663)if you then look at screen, it's make object! ... etc which is all well and good..

[01:51](#msg5aa1e8b90a1614b712fb51a5)if I then do view screen, the screen is displayed, and I can drag the button around

[01:52](#msg5aa1e8e5458cbde55711c3f9)if I then close the window and look at screen again, I can see that the offset of the button now reflects where I dragged it to

[01:53](#msg5aa1e8fe8f1c77ef3a9c9205)which is great !

[01:54](#msg5aa1e938458cbde55711c49a)However, if I save screen to a file, and then try to load it, it gives me errors - I can't display the window again

[01:54](#msg5aa1e96e0a1614b712fb5457)things like, it has saved things like

[01:54](#msg5aa1e96f0a1614b712fb5459)parent: make object! \[...]

[01:55](#msg5aa1e9758f1c77ef3a9c9362)which is not valid

[01:56](#msg5aa1e9c7e4d1c63604db81b4)I tried setting parent to none instead, still no good

[01:57](#msg5aa1e9ef6f8b4b9946064ace)Admittedly, I haven't looked too deeply into the errors yet, but any initial thoughts on whether or not this would be the right way to go about trying to do something like this ?

[02:00](#msg5aa1eacdc3c5f8b90d4de8d8)ie, manipulate a GUI via the GUI, eg, drag things around to position them as you want, then save the code (in whatever is the most appropriate format) so that we can use it to display the GUI again later.

[02:01](#msg5aa1eaf10a1614b712fb58e4)I guess, the kind of thing you'd do in some programming IDE, Visual Studio etc, to design a screen

dockimbel

[03:28](#msg5aa1ff73e4ff28713a0ee548)@guraaku Your idea is totally doable, but you can't save the face objects graph from memory to disk directly, because of the cyclic references and run-time state values that would not be valid anymore once reloaded. The solution is to write a small saver/loader for the face object tree, that will save only a subset of the face properties and recreate the tree on load.

[03:51](#msg5aa204dcc3c5f8b90d4e3fb5)Another approach could be just to reset some face properties (we call them facets), and then save the object tree directly:

```
view lay: layout [button "ok" text "hello" panel [text "nested"]]
foreach-face lay [face/parent: none face/state: none]
lay/parent: lay/state: none
save %faces.red lay
```

Though, in order to use it after reload, you need to reduce the nested objects, as object literals don't have a literal form (yet), only a construction expression.

[04:10](#msg5aa2093e8f1c77ef3a9cfa73)Here is a fully working example: https://gist.github.com/dockimbel/c4ec0145e3a8ba776e05b4895a8d8733

[04:13](#msg5aa209fb6f8b4b994606bcd2)@greggirwin I think we could provide some helper mezz functions like `save-faces` and `load-faces` to help with that?

[04:16](#msg5aa20a976fba1a703ae61ec7)@qtxie Do you remember a ticket for `save` doing a `mold/only` instead of just a `mold` on the argument? With current behaviour, you cannot save nested blocks properly.

[06:33](#msg5aa22ad453c1dbb743bf52dd)Are the `parent` and `state` facets the only important elements for cycle prevention? `Actors` is the only other facet I see that might be an issue, but it should be safe, yes? I would like to save the data prettified if we do it.

[07:29](#msg5aa237eb6fba1a703ae6d804)@guraaku, note that one of the things you give up with a system like this is VID's auto layout engine. By dragging and dropping, without a smart constraint system, you end up with absolute coordinates for each face. Not terrible, as that's how the rest of them do it.

Actors are safe as long as they don't depend on bindings to external objects.

[09:26](#msg5aa25347458cbde557136ad1)Saving the VID version of a GUI is surely easier, though it won't capture the facets changed after display.

[19:08](#msg5aa2db91e4d1c63604e019f9)@guraaku, (those of you who know this story, just move along) I used to specialize in VB. When I'd suggest using it, people would say it would be too slow. One of my tactics was to say, "OK, let's just prototype with it, then build the real thing in C. It will save us time." So we'd do that, I'd show a working app, then say "Now, we can rewrite it in C." They'd say "But it all seems to work. Why would we do that?" :^)

[19:08](#msg5aa2dbcb53c1dbb743c31853)Red \*is* Alpha though, so really know it will do all you need if committing for production work. We can help with that here. Any OOB tools are great for it though.

guraaku

[23:07](#msg5aa31394c3c5f8b90d53b730)morning @greggirwin :) Yes, sounds like a good tactic. I think getting to use anything other than our preferred platforms (C# and Java) will be an uphill battle at this point, but I'll continue working on my prototype and see how far I can get with it. If I can present something that works and has other significant advantages, eg much less code, quicker to implement, easier maintenance etc then it will be up to someone else to make the decision as to why we shouldn't use it.

[23:09](#msg5aa31435e4ff28713a144d33)Regardless, it's fun playing around with Red, and I usually find that the different ideas that you get exposed to when looking at other things seem to come in handy later on. Even if you can't use that other language, you may be able to implement some of the ideas in whatever language you have to work with.

[23:12](#msg5aa314c68f1c77ef3aa244c4)Regarding your comment about giving up VID's auto layout, yes, that's something to consider. Whether or not I can come up with a way to default to the auto layout, then use the absolute coordinates if a user does decide that the default isn't exactly what they like.

greggirwin

[23:26](#msg5aa31824e4d1c63604e139e4)Red is a \*great* tool for thinking. That may be its killer feature.

[08:14](#msg5aa393fa8f1c77ef3aa3f3bd)So if you wanted your newly drop-created faces to also be draggable, to reposition them after dropping, just include that option.

[08:15](#msg5aa3940e0a1614b71202ceb8)yes, interestingly, when I read in the saved face tree - using the previously posted code,the button was no longer loose

[08:15](#msg5aa3943e0a1614b71202cf38)@greggirwin @9214 There is still a `make-face` constructor on our todo-list for View, let me see what would be required to support it.

guraaku

[08:17](#msg5aa394a753c1dbb743c5e6c0)seems there's a few different ways to do these kind of dynamic additions to GUIs...

[08:18](#msg5aa394cb888332ee3a1e5780)I think I would have liked to save the final GUI as VID, but it seems less work to just save and load the face tree

[08:19](#msg5aa394f7e4ff28713a16013e)Because, as you drag around things etc, the face tree will be automatically updated

greggirwin

[08:22](#msg5aa395c3e4d1c63604e2d30d)@dockimbel, `make-face` just being a helper, so setting the default action and such is easier, or a dialected func?

dockimbel

[08:23](#msg5aa395f5c3c5f8b90d557cbb)@guraaku That's an interesting concept. Would it be possible to write a reverse-VID constructor, that, given a face tree, would construct back the equivalent (ideally minimal) VID source code? I guess it could be achieved to some extent.

[08:23](#msg5aa3961c35dd17022e41cb33)@greggirwin It should be able to support VID actors.

greggirwin

[08:25](#msg5aa3966cf3f6d24c685ac4d6)@dockimbel, we talked about constraint based systems some time back. This (reverse VID) could be an experiment along those lines.

[08:26](#msg5aa396ce35dd17022e41cd55)But I don't know that you could guarantee an exact match. It might turn out better than your manual layout of course. Many fun thoughts there. We don't have `guide` yet, which might help with that as well.

guraaku

[08:27](#msg5aa396f6f3f6d24c685ac6f0)I guess there could be multiple different VIDs that lead to the same face tree, ...

[08:27](#msg5aa397066f8b4b99460de809)but, any one of them would be acceptable, given they all produce the same thing

greggirwin

[08:28](#msg5aa39748f3f6d24c685ac834)Yes, or close to. e.g., you could eval the face tree, then generate both `across`-based and `below`-based layouts and see which gets closer. Also looking at average spacing, to set a `space` value.

generated script, the 'Try it' button will allow you to run the script and the 'Clear it' button will clear the  
layout page. There's a lot more that could be added to this one.

virtualAlan

[00:05](#msg5aa9b8d3e4ff28713a32f130)Yes the clicking creating a new button without dragging it is an easy one, Controlling those loose faces is a good idea. A simple 'If' in the right place is all that's needed. The idea is to isolate the drag button from the click button, so it's all about screen coordinates.  
The drag button is in one area and the click button is in another one. I'll do another script using Greggs latest example as a starter.

[10:12](#msg5ab8c772e4ff28713a74e309)Question about View engine.  
There is a `screen` face. How to use it?  
For example, I have two monitors. And I want to put window on the second monitor...

9214

[10:12](#msg5ab8c785c4d0ae8007009dc6)@DVL333 `system/view/screens`

[10:12](#msg5ab8c7aa458cbde55778266f)in your case `system/view/screens/2` should be the second display.

DVL333

[10:13](#msg5ab8c7cabb1018b37a26ec19)@9214 So what?  
`system/view/screens` in this case contain information only about the first monitor.

[10:14](#msg5ab8c815e4ff28713a74e585)

```
system/view/screens/2
== none
```

9214

[10:14](#msg5ab8c821c4d0ae800700a0b7)@qtxie does View supports multiple monitors or is it TBD? :point\_up:

[10:23](#msg5ab8ca0abb1018b37a26f6c9)@9214 And even if it is TBD, how to assign a window to the screen? Is it a right variant?

```
w1: make face! [type: 'window size: 200x200]

```

9214

[10:23](#msg5ab8ca20e4ff28713a74edb5)@DVL333 are you trying to build tree of faces by hand?

[10:24](#msg5ab8ca50458cbde557783152)@DVL333 https://github.com/9214/smorgasbord/blob/master/red/tree-of-faces.red

[10:28](#msg5ab8cb55e4ff28713a74f360)@DVL333 `screen` face is no different than any other `face!` object

[10:29](#msg5ab8cb7335dd17022e9f23b7)There're mandatory facets that you need to specify, they're listed \[here](https://doc.red-lang.org/en/view.html#\_face\_object)

DVL333

[10:37](#msg5ab8cd60458cbde557784037)@9214 I'm just investagation this doc. :) So I have this question. Ok, we can create `screen` face as a clone of `face!` object, in my example i have done it. But how to use it further together with other faces?

9214

[10:39](#msg5ab8cdcce4ff28713a74feed)Basically you need to specify `screen` face as a parent of some window, and populate the `pane` of your `screen` with one (or many) windows. See my example above.

[10:40](#msg5ab8ce0f35dd17022e9f2fd4)@DVL333  
&gt; in my example i have done it

your example is nonsense, because `system/view/screens/2` is `none` and you're trying to bind it to a face that doesn't contain mandatory facets.

DVL333

[10:43](#msg5ab8ced4458cbde5577847f5)But it means, that it is useless to create `screen` face manually.  
I have written "And even if it is TBD...", just imagine that it works. If it has worked, my example would have been right? You can offer your own variant - i am just asking about it.

9214

[10:43](#msg5ab8ceeb7c3a01610d76046d)Does the content of `system/view/screens` differs if you're examining it on different monitors?

[10:45](#msg5ab8cf3727c509a774a498cd)Though, if you have two identical monitors that won't tell us much :)

DVL333

[10:53](#msg5ab8d10ec574b1aa3e331c40)@9214 No, it's the same - information about first monitor. Even if the console is on the second monitor.

[10:53](#msg5ab8d131e3d0b1ff2c6b2c1c)Monitors are different with different resolutions.

rebolek

[10:54](#msg5ab8d1527c3a01610d760fdf)I don't think multiple monitors support is ready.

9214

[10:55](#msg5ab8d194458cbde5577854ab)@qtxie or @dockimbel might say for sure, but since View didn't automagically populated `system/vew/screens` with new faces, I don't think that adding them manually will change anything.

[10:55](#msg5ab8d1abc4d0ae800700d0bb)There won't be any coupling beween virtual face and physical device.

DVL333

[11:06](#msg5ab8d452c4d0ae800700dd53)My question wasn't about manual assignment windows to different monitors, that Red doesn't "see", my questions was about using `screen` face \*\*in general\*\*. How to use it together with other faces. @9214 has given an example, but it doesn't use `screen` face...

9214

[11:07](#msg5ab8d47a2b9dfdbc3a228edd)@DVL333 Really? \[It doesn't](https://github.com/9214/smorgasbord/blob/master/red/tree-of-faces.red#L11)?

DVL333

[11:10](#msg5ab8d50bc4d0ae800700e063)Really. Do you see screen face in your example? Do you create it? You only set `system/view/screens/1` as a parent facet for `window`.

9214

[11:12](#msg5ab8d5ab5f188ccc15f97957)And why you need to create another `screen` face, just for the fun of it?

[11:13](#msg5ab8d5d427c509a774a4b9ff)I mean, it would be technically useless, because only existent face in `screens` is coupled with your physical display.

[11:13](#msg5ab8d5f7458cbde557786b72)You can, in theory, create second face and then delete the first one, but I have doubts that it will work.

[11:15](#msg5ab8d63ec574b1aa3e33384c)`screen` is only used as the topmost parent for faces:

&gt; In order for any face to be displayed on screen, it must be connected to a screen face directly (for windows) or indirectly (for other face types).

DVL333

[11:18](#msg5ab8d7025f188ccc15f9835b)I am orienting on official documentation: it describes how to creates different faces and how to create `screen` face among them. So I am asking this question. :) And according to you it is really useless. But it means that official documentation has mess information. Ok, i see.

9214

[11:19](#msg5ab8d73fbb1018b37a273c06)&gt; official documentation has mess information

would be really interesting to see the "messy" parts, if you have time to point them out

DVL333

[11:22](#msg5ab8d7fec4d0ae800700edc9)part about describing `screen` object with its facets (6.17). If we needn't use it, and create it manually, what is the reason for that among describing other faces that we really create manually?

9214

[11:25](#msg5ab8d8b5f3f6d24c68b86c09)@DVL333 so we should avoid mentioning `'screen` type just because there's no use for it just yet?

[11:25](#msg5ab8d8bd5f188ccc15f98ba0)I don't follow your logic.

[11:26](#msg5ab8d8d627c509a774a4c97f)It's called \*reference documentation* for a reason.

DVL333

[11:32](#msg5ab8da682b9dfdbc3a22ac8a)My logic is that I read this documentation and try to write examples. In differ parts of this document there is notices like "don't use it, it is automatical and only for your information", but in this part that notice is omitted. So I can suppose that it usefull information and decided to ask a question.

[11:34](#msg5ab8dab82b9dfdbc3a22ae29)This part is really confusing.

9214

[11:36](#msg5ab8db43e3d0b1ff2c6b5f87)@DVL333 you can create any face object from `face!` prototype and change its facets, but AFAIK there's no use for manually created facet with `'screen` type. Still, it's used in View engine and is useful to know about. I don't understand which part of that is so confusing for you.

[11:37](#msg5ab8db7ee4ff28713a75461c)Maybe there is such usage but I'm unaware of it, maybe there will be one or two use-cases.

dockimbel

[15:22](#msg5ab9103af3f6d24c68b99758)@9214  
&gt; @qtxie or @dockimbel might say for sure, but since View didn't automagically populated `system/vew/screens` with new faces, I don't think that adding them manually will change anything.

Correct. The screen faces are the virtual representation of physical screens, so adding new ones will have no effect.

[15:23](#msg5ab9106c5f188ccc15fab6e6)View does not support yet multiple screens. It should not be a big work to support, though, it's far away in our tasks priorities for now.

If there is a particular concept like functional or symbolic programming for example, or how to work with blocks and `compose` and `reduce` for example that you can illustrate in just a few lines of code, I would appreciate you either messaging me or tagging me with it.

&gt; We should prepare generic presentation that everyone can use.

That would be very useful! A collaborative approach would be welcome.

greggirwin

[18:51](#msg5abd35a992f5d6205773a7cb)@AlexanderBaggett @rgchris's 10 steps is a great place to start. We often want to show the most advanced and mind-bending things Red can do, but Carl worked really hard to hide those details for a reason, I believe. It's too much, too soon. If you show that Red is comfortable, and has advanced features like VID (which always makes for great demos, and is easy to do live), then when people say "What's so special about that? It works like every other scripting language.", \*then* you can hit them with "Red is so powerful it can emulate any type of language. It's a language construction toolkit that just happens to come with a bunch of prebuilt languages to get you started."

[18:53](#msg5abd362fc4d0ae800715fa03)If you can setup the mandelbrot demo, to show Red/System's speed and ease of use, and also a quick cross-compiler script to build for any platform, that's gone over well for me in the past. Showing some of the best existing demos is also great. Ballots is one of my favorites.

[19:09](#msg5abd39f392f5d6205773b970)Assuming you have %red.exe and %hello.red in a dir, a cross compiler can just do something like this:

```
Red []

targets: [
    Windows
    MSDOS
    Linux
    Darwin
]

in-dir: function [
	"Evaluate a block in a directory"
	dir  [file!]  "Directory to work in; reset after body is done"
	block [block!] "Block to evaluate"
][
	orig: what-dir
	change-dir dir
	also do block change-dir orig
]

cross-compile: func [target script][
    print ['Compiling script 'for target]
    make-dir/deep append copy %bin/ target
    in-dir append copy %bin/ target [
        call/show probe form reduce [
            to-local-file clean-path %../../red
            ;to-local-file system/options/boot  ; doesn't work right now
            "-c -t" target
            append copy "..\..\" script
        ]
    ]
]

print "Red cross-compiler launcher^/"

;cross-compile 'Windows %hello.red
foreach target targets [cross-compile target %hello.red]

halt

greggirwin

[22:21](#msg5abd66ee5f188ccc150f2280)Red is currently single threaded, with concurrency planned for a future release.

[22:22](#msg5abd6712c4d0ae800716db5f)In the meantime, you may need to include a `do-events/no-wait` call to let the GUI event loop update things.

9214

[22:23](#msg5abd675d270d7d3708730e39)@kotshie I guess `view/no-wait [...]` is what you need?

greggirwin

[22:23](#msg5abd6772e3d0b1ff2c80e4d2)If you're not already updating the GUI, can you show us your VID code and we can suggest how to approach it. Normally, as soon as you update the facet of a GUI face, it will show the change.

[22:24](#msg5abd67bbc4d0ae800716dd8d)e.g. `view [time: text 100 rate 0:0:1 on-time [face/data: now/time]]`

[22:25](#msg5abd67e72b9dfdbc3a37fb2a)In VID, you can use set-words, which then refer to a face, so you can make changes outside a face's event handlers.

[19:49](#msg5ac67de6c574b1aa3e6f0f2a)Assuming that `{...}` can contain only alphabetic characters of course, otherwise you should omit conversion to `set-word!` and object creation, because your block will be just a key/value storage.

greggirwin

[19:52](#msg5ac67e607c3a01610db07787)@nd9600 as @9214 mentioned, there is the `collect` keyword in `parse` and there is the `collect` function in Red. Once you play around a bit, you'll find what is most comfortable for each of your use cases.

9214

[19:52](#msg5ac67e887c3a01610db078e7)@nd9600 also, I'm not sure if it's 100% compatible with R2 `parse`.

greggirwin

[19:53](#msg5ac67eaa109bb0433290baaa)And don't forget that you can use `-` in Red words, which is more idiomatic than underscores.

[19:53](#msg5ac67ec51130fe3d36a74c93)@nd9600, `keep` is a tricky thing, implicit in the context of the `collect` func, or the `parse` dialect.

nd9600

[19:53](#msg5ac67ed3270d7d37089881b0)The only difference I've seen in the parses so far is Rebol doesn't let you go to or thru a rule, only to input or a datatype

[14:27](#msg5aca26dc92f5d62057a76cac)@ifmihai Hi Michael. Thanks. Maybe I'll do that. I haven't used VSC yet.  
Some 15 minutes ago I finished setting up \[helpin.red](http://helpin.red) . I'm not sure it's working properly, and it is seriously under development, but it already has some extra material, specially on the Draw dialect. It also has downloads of many formats, like pdf, word and windows help file... IF everything is working properly on the website, of course.

[16:21](#msg5aca417492f5d62057a7cdc6)@Ungaretti looks nice! which resource will be the primary in the future? helpin.red? or the notebook? i was set to give you some mini corrections and changes, while i'm reading the notebook. But unfortunately, i cannot sign in to add comments. gitbook doesn't let me, it says i am malicious :smile:

[16:30](#msg5aca438b27c509a774edf351)@Ungaretti for now, as a newbie, i can tell you that the most confusing part for me, is about red executable: where should i place it, if PATH settings are needed, if i can rename the executable or not (i would like it to be red.exe, not red-063.exe), what's the best practice to organize red files on hdd, does red installs some files first time it runs? where is this location? I would love to see these questions answered in the notebook or helpin.red

9214

[16:36](#msg5aca44fa080a3850530d98b0)@ifmihai  
&gt; where should i place it

Anywhere. Setting up a PATH is completely up to you.

&gt; if i can rename the executable or not

You can.

&gt; what's the best practice to organize red files on hdd

Depends on the project and your preferences.

&gt; does red installs some files first time it runs?

Toolchain compiles compression library and unpacks Console executable, you can find them in `ProgramData/Red` if I'm not mistaken.

ifmihai

[16:42](#msg5aca46936d7e07082bd0a407)@9214 ah, this makes more sense, thank you for the (fast) clarification. indeed, there's a ProgramData/Red folder in there. I kept searching in my username's folder, didn't think to search ProgramData (I don't have a clue what's its purpose :D). Clearly, documentation lacks in this area. It would be useful to have this information added in the notebook.

[16:46](#msg5aca4758df3e0fb547b66126)Also, I have a pressing question, since first contact with red. I saw that rebol can use a C dll file, with load/library (if i remember correctly). Closest info i found about red, was routine! datatype, but not much else. Is it possible at this stage of red, to use a C dll file somehow? i have 2 versions of the dll file, 32bit and 64bit. This would help me a lot, to prioritize my work

9214

[16:47](#msg5aca47a16bbe1d2739c4bfdc)@ifmihai it will be possible with an \[upcoming](https://trello.com/c/MR6HCDxV/186-red-core) `library!` datatype. For now you need to use Red/System \[imports](https://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html#section-15).

[16:49](#msg5aca480c92f5d62057a7ed24)Though recently this feature was postponed to future releases.

ifmihai

[16:51](#msg5aca48a927c509a774ee0544)@9214 cool, wasn't aware of library! datatype on the roadmap. that's great. For now, Red/System is kind of a nebulous subject for me, i have to understand what it is exactly, and why the need for it. What would be the sequence of action? use Red/System to import each function? then use them in normal red files?

Ungaretti

[16:54](#msg5aca493c7c3a01610dbe86ee)@ifmihai Until this morning I was not even sure I could make a website out of HelpNDoc outputs, but since it seems OK, all future updates will be done at helpin.red . I have many issues with gitbook aside of those you mention.  
Please (!) send me all corrections and suggestions and ideas! They are very welcome! I strongly suggest you use private messages or post it at gitter red/docs conversation, as it fits better there.

9214

[16:56](#msg5aca49a65f188ccc15429fb5)@ifmihai Red/System is a low-level DSL (domain-specific language) for system programming, and a compilation target for Red (R/S, in turn, compiles down to native machine code). You can look at examples of using imported functions \[here](https://github.com/red/code/tree/master/Library).

[16:58](#msg5aca4a205f188ccc1542a13a)@rebolek also has \[simple examples](http://red.qyz.cz/red-system-from-red.html) of using R/S from Red in his blog.

ifmihai

[17:03](#msg5aca4b5d109bb043329ead47)@9214 cool github page with that list! thanks! So, R/S is about speed? if i get it right? Would make sense to write code in R/S for hot parts of your code? then call it from normal red files?

[17:04](#msg5aca4ba5109bb043329eadc2)@Ungaretti i wasn't even aware that private messages are possible on gitter :smile: I am newbie with gitter too. red/docs sounds more logical, indeed. I would prefer private messages for now though

9214

[17:05](#msg5aca4bf52b9dfdbc3a6b5ea5)@ifmihai yes, it's a C-level language (albeit a bit slower than C, because we don't have any optimizations layers in place). If you're willing to sacrifice flexibility and expressiveness for speed (and if you don't mind compiling your project instead on interpreting it) - sure, you can rewrite bottlenecks in R/S, either using `routine!`s or separate files.

[11:30](#msg5ad5daba6bbe1d2739f5d656)does the RED compiler convert red/system to assembly or directly byte codes for PC/Mac/Linux ?

rebolek

[11:31](#msg5ad5db0b6bbe1d2739f5d8d6)directly to machine code, otherwise you would need another compiler that would compile assembly to machine code

9214

[11:31](#msg5ad5db0c2b9dfdbc3a9c228d)@githubnyn Red compiles to R/S, R/S compiles down to platform-specific machine code.

githubnyn

[11:41](#msg5ad5dd7c7c3a01610def134b)so in order to convert `a: 1 + 2` to byte code I guess you first need to convert it to assembly on paper, then find out the corrisponding byte codes of Windows / OS X / Linux and then tell the compiler to use these byte codes ?

rebolek

[11:42](#msg5ad5ddb27c3a01610def13df)@githubnyn Red compiler knows the right bytecodes, so does the conversion for you

githubnyn

[11:52](#msg5ad5dff45f188ccc15738215)I see. I guess my question would be when writing a compiler you first use ASM as reference to get the byte codes needed by the compiler

rebolek

[11:54](#msg5ad5e086109bb04332cf36fd)Yes, you would need it as reference, so you would know that `push ebp` in assembler is `C5 F0` in machine code (it isn't, I just made it up, but you get the idea).

[11:55](#msg5ad5e0b77c3a01610def21ff)But there's no need for compiler to first translate code to assembler and then to machine code, because the mapping between assembler and machine code is 1:1

@greggirwin @amreus Should we add this to https://github.com/red/red/wiki/Differences-between-Red-and-Rebol as it works in R2 (didn't test with R3 yet)

[08:59](#msg5aeec3e66f9af87e0447b937)@endo64 If you add it there, just mention that's a temporary difference. The lexer is far from its final form yet.

amreus

[12:29](#msg5aeef5285cf0b830045e0351)Thanks all. Would it make sense to have a issue tracker for differences instead of a wiki? That way differences can be tracked, and closed as they are implemented.

endo64

[21:14](#msg5aef703dff26986d083940d3)But not all differences will be implemented and closed, most of them is by design so they should be noted in a wiki like docs, instead of tracking. About `to-date`, we could open an issue on git to not forget it to implement.

Re-git

[17:54](#msg5af1e4695cf0b830046732d5)Hi, I just started playing with Red. It really like the idea of super simple gui programming but I have problem with this very simple toy code.  
I want to display the choosen filename path changing text in gui but it does not seem to work, after choosing the file from the dialog, text does not change and keeps diplaying "some text".  
Here is my code:

`Red [] x: "some text" View[ test-btn: button "Test me" [ my-file: request-file txt/text: my-file] txt: text x]`

Can you help me understand what I'm doing wrong here?

9214

[18:18](#msg5af1e9f300dc488804a51bf6)Hi @vejitatoja, you need to convert `file!` to `string!` explicitly, say, with `mold` or `form`:

```
view [button "file" [t/text: mold request-file] return t: text 400x20 "text"]
```

Or, to prettify things, with `to-local-file`:

```
view [button "file" [t/text: to-local-file request-file] return t: text 400x20 "text"]
```

toomasv

[18:23](#msg5af1eb1600dc488804a51fb3)@vejitatoja One possibility is also to use `data` facet of `text` face:

```
x: "some text" View[ test-btn: button "Test me" [ my-file: request-file txt/data: my-file] txt: text x]
```

[18:25](#msg5af1eb9fff26986d0841655b)@vejitatoja :point\_up: `text` and `data` facet are synchronized, and once `data` is updated `text` will be set to its `form`ed representation. Or, if you'd updated `text`, `data` would be updated with `load`ed data.

Re-git

[18:46](#msg5af1f070da323a7c0407efab)@9214 Thank you! Using `form` or `mold` everything worked. Your answer made me realize that there are different object types like `file!` and `string!`

9214

[18:49](#msg5af1f127f2d2d537047261cd)@vejitatoja they are not objects though, just values. Red has ~50 datatypes and counting.

`word: 'value` is the same as `set 'word 'value`, same for `get`. `+` and `add` are not equivalent, even if both perform addition - first is an infix operator, second is a function.

[00:41](#msg5b060a369ed336150ea6ba86)`inc` doesn't work as expected because you set `word`, not `x`. In `inc-broken`and `inc-broken2`, `:word` evaluates to `x`, not to integer.

Correct, blocks are not evaluated immediately, hence:

```

word ; == 1
x ; *** Script Error: x has no value

We are setting `word` to 1 not its evaluated value (`x`) to 1.

What am I setting in functions `set2` and `set3`?  
It looks like neither `x` nor `word`

endo64

[23:24](#msg5b089b3454ce231361562003)@vejitatoja for `set2` function, to understand better, lets put some `probe`s

```
set2: func ['word] [probe x probe word: 2 probe x]
set2 x
0
2
0
```

your function gets an un-evaluated word (`x` and its value is 0 in global context)  
then your function sets a value (2) to a locally bound word (`word`) (bound to function itself ). So you cannot see its value in outer (global) context:  
`>> word == ** word has no value ( > in global context < I added this)`  
And this `'word` has nothing related to 'x actually. it is just a local word in your function.  
So you are not setting `'x`. If you want you should use your `set1`

[23:27](#msg5b089be3edd06f7d15e4447d)`set word value` is same as `word: value` if both are in the same context (for example it is global context if you are on REPL console).  
otherwise `set word value` sets the `word`s value in global context if you are not explicitly give the context, like `set in obj 'word 2` sets the `word`s value in the context of `obj`

[23:28](#msg5b089c10361a950a66171e03)And @ne1uno is right, lets use another word for `word` it is already enough confusing :) `'w` is better I think.

[07:15](#msg5b0909a9b6eece791db4596f)@vejitatoja `word` evaluates to `x`, but `'word` and `word:` do not evaluate to `'x` and `x:`. Each word has a spelling (its `form`ed representation). `set-word!`, `get-word!` and `lit-word!` are all part of the word syntax, and are constructed by appending/prepending either `:` or `'` to the `load`ed spelling of a word:

```
>> spelling: "word"
== "word"
>> load spelling
== word
>> type? load spelling
== word!
>> append copy spelling ":"
== "word:"
>> type? load append copy spelling ":"
== set-word!
>> type? load head insert copy spelling ":"
== get-word!
>> type? load head insert copy spelling "'"
== lit-word!
```

So, when you write `word:` in `set2` and `set3`, you're applying this syntax to the word that has spelling `word`, not to the word that has spelling `x`. Since `word` appears in function's specification, it is local to function's context, hence you can't see it "from the outside". In `set1`, on the other hand, `x` comes from the outside world and is bound to some context (`system/words` in our case) so what you function does is simply changing its value in its context: since `set` is a function, it evaluates its arguments, `word` evaluates to `x`, `1` evaluates to itself, then `x` word in `system/words` context is set to an integer `1`.

Phew! :smile:

endo64

[13:09](#msg5b095c82160c567d16dc5b90)Once again its time to give this nice example I love :) `words carry their contexts`

```
>> a: 0  o: context [a: 1]  p: context [a: 2]
>> b: reduce ['a in o 'a in p 'a]
== [a a a]

>> reduce b
== [0 1 2]

>> set in o 'a 3
== 3

>> reduce b
== [0 3 2]
```

`set a-word a-value` is always sets the value of a word in global context if you did not explicitly give another context using `in` or similar. That's what happen in your set1 function and not in set2 &amp; set3.

hiiamboris

[16:04](#msg5b0c2889361a950a66207f2b)@vejitatoja in your example the function body block was implicitly bound to the function context (which only contains the words `var start stop step block` - so when you change these you change them in this \*function* context). But the block `[multiply ... ]` was declared in the global context and was implicitly bound to it, so any set-words inside it apply to the global context, not the function context where it's executed with `do`. I find it important to know when and to what block's words were bound, and that it holds and carries these bindings around for you.

9214

[16:27](#msg5b0c2e0754ce2313615f870d)@hiiamboris words in function's body block were bound to the global context, and then rebound to a context of a newly created function with `func`.

[14:49](#msg5b14000b160c567d16fd0a17)Hi there, have been following Red for many years now. In order to simplify my life I've decided to get rid of all the others and focus on Red, which will eventually address all my needs for personal projects. I have a suggestion. In general if you have some previous programming knowledge, it's easy to ramp up. Conditional statements, looping, bindings, data type etc...although there are some minor differences, pretty much all languages have them, so the concept is familiar. What trips me up is the parse dialect. I would love to see more resources, or maybe even a dedicated space for getting to grips with and becoming proficient with how to use parse. Maybe having something like "parse challenges" website or page. A space that focuses solely on working with parse. The prospect of easily creating DSLs and parsing things from structured text/data is such a wow factor and brings a whole new level of developer expressivity to the table that I hope at some point more resources that focus on this piece will be available.

[22:20](#msg5b15bb1b35e25f39974bd6cb)We have to remember that even though Red makes parsing much easier than other langs, language \*design\*, and parsing in general are still hard. We can really only make them easier with constraints. e.g. we can offer tools and templates for common cases, where people just want different keywords or outputs. We also don't have to use `parse` for building dialects, and we can encourage people to use other approaches, without stigmatizing them.

[01:32](#msg5b15e81693dc78791cb018cd)I have a tutorial for Rebol3 in progress that covers some aspects of 'parse, which should be pretty compatible with Red's 'parse. It allows you to experiment with parse in real-time on the tutorial webpage: http://video.respectech.com:8080/tutorial/r3/index.r3

[01:34](#msg5b15e8b0352b9e1a4b5c25dc)I'm planning on making a comparable tutorial for Red as soon as 0.7 is ready.

[09:36](#msg5b17ab2616f64961240f0bd9)morning

[09:37](#msg5b17ab74160c567d1609710a)i'm aware that there is still no x86\_64 support nor GUI for linux, but wonder if someone familiar with Scheme (Guile, Racket,...) can shed some light about Red vs Scheme i nregard to ease of learning etc.?

maximvl

[09:38](#msg5b17ab9f22a05f5e7105a882)@gour Red doesn't have great docs/specs yet, so most learning I did came from code and Rebol docs

[09:38](#msg5b17abaf016ae21a4c142070)which is still ok, you just need to keep in mind that there might be difference

[09:39](#msg5b17abe1a45f930a6505ebeb)also Scheme is more "minimalistic" language with few primitive constructs, Red feels more like a Common Lisp with a lot of features builtin

[09:41](#msg5b17ac3f82a4d36ea6d46703)most notable differences which needs most attention to be learned properly (in my opinion): 1. series 2. contexts 3. parse

[09:43](#msg5b17acc4b0d8ca5f1a82dc09)ease of learning really depends on your background, some people can't get lisp at all :)

gour

[09:43](#msg5b17acccedd06f7d151396ff)@maximvl thanks. have you maybe seen 'Red book' ?

maximvl

[09:44](#msg5b17ace193dc78791cb66144)the one available on amazon?

[09:44](#msg5b17acfd352b9e1a4b6264e1)there is this one: https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Red-Fundamentals-running-language/dp/1789130700

[09:44](#msg5b17ad05b0d8ca5f1a82dcd2)but I haven't read it, you should ask @9214

gour

[09:44](#msg5b17ad1be26c847ac8bfaf71)well, i did play a bit with FP (haskell), bu never grokked monads, iow having mostly experience with imperative stuff...didn't do programming for a long time and would looking for some hobby-language...

maximvl

[09:46](#msg5b17ad7135e25f3997527a0c)then Red should fit quite well, there is no "crazy functional" stuff like monads (et least yet), most code is written easily in imperative style

[09:46](#msg5b17ad83016ae21a4c1426db)you can do complicated things quite easily

[09:49](#msg5b17ae3cb0d8ca5f1a82e107)Red is more 'batteries included' than Scheme, and there's no FP bigotry whatsoever.

endo64

[09:51](#msg5b17ae9835e25f3997527d7f)@gour Red is a perfect fit for you :)  
@greggirwin wrote some thoughts about the book but I couldn't find it on gitter as its search capability is terrible.  
You can also check https://github.com/red/red/wiki/Learning-resources for some good learning stuff.

gour

[09:51](#msg5b17aea7352b9e1a4b626cf0)although i'm aware i can use console to do many scripting stuff

9214

[09:51](#msg5b17aeb8edd06f7d15139f22)That's a fair concern, but there's more in the package than fancy GUIs.

[09:52](#msg5b17aed84eaffb692d86c373)Mastering the fundamental principles does not require View or 64 bit support.

gour

[09:52](#msg5b17aedd16f64961240f1b8a)@endo64 i know about learning-resources, but, hopefully (good) book can save time, at least in the beginning

[10:03](#msg5b17b17982a4d36ea6d47abc)x64 would be a waste of resources right now, as the Red compiler needs to be re-written in Red (self-hosted), so migrating to x64 in the current state would be double work, as it would need to be thrown away once Red is self-hosted.

[20:28](#msg5b1843fefcefb41e8a92215c)@bferris413 basically because `::x` is not a valid syntax. `:` is not a function or an operator, it's a part of the word datatype, so you can't nest them like that.

[23:20](#msg5b1f03c532618e705eb2061d)@endo, that's a great example. We have https://github.com/red/red/wiki/Reference-Call, but it's pretty old now, and may not be correct for the new GUI console behavior. `Call` is very important, and deserves a really good wiki page, until we get a real doc page for it.

[13:13](#msg5b2a530c59799e70172d63b3)Hi there! About a week ago I started writing a guide to learn Red, you can read it here: https://crypticwyrm.neocities.org/learningred/ . Has a few screencasts too and I try to explain the differences to Rebol so that you can make use of Rebol learning resources. I'm currently updating the guide every day or two, it's far from complete but there is already a lot of content giving an overview of Red.

rebolek

[13:14](#msg5b2a5350ad21887018ca8dc8)@cryptowyrm great, every tutorial is most welcome!

cryptowyrm

[13:16](#msg5b2a539e6ceffe4eba1c60b2)I thought so :) I saw there is a Helpin Red guide now which is super useful, but I'm also writing this to get a deeper understanding of the language myself, been using Red and Rebol before that for a decade, but never got deep into the language. Now that Red is becoming ever more attractive, I want to change that, and teaching is supposedly the best way to learn :)

rebolek

[13:21](#msg5b2a54caaeb8fa0c072bf9e4)Some pedants may have objections to the variables chapter, as there are no variables in Red/Rebol, but I guess it's fine in basic guide.

cryptowyrm

[13:24](#msg5b2a55aa7da8cd7c8c58c67b)Ah yes :) The whole word!, lit-word!, get-word!, set-word! thing is what I personally always found most confusing about Rebol, its just so different compared to other languages, quite possible that I'm still confused there and have to change some things as I learn more about it, I'll add a chapter for that once I feel I know enough about the topic, I think that could be really helpful.

rebolek

[13:28](#msg5b2a566a960fcd4eb90fd90a)It's not confusing when you \*get* it, it's actually very simple concept. But I understand the source of confusion when coming from another language.

cryptowyrm

[13:31](#msg5b2a571d6ceffe4eba1c69ee)I hope so :) Writing this has already helped me a lot in writing better Red code because I noticed I didn't really understand some things before. You can get super far with Rebol and Red while learning very little. I also went through lots of the old Rebol 2 and 3 docs and found some nice tricks I was never aware of. I plan to compile those into a chapter as well, so that the guide can be useful for both beginners and people already familiar with the language.

9214

[15:36](#msg5b2a749b5862c35f47b4d60c)&gt; Some pedants may have objections to the variables chapter, as there are no variables in Red/Rebol, but I guess it's fine in basic guide.

I wouldn't say that it's fine to confuse other newcomers and force them to learn the wrong models, especially when the author himself doesn't understand what he's talking about.

[15:39](#msg5b2a7532479ca266896c25cd)OTOH, people will call you a pedant if you'll try to teach the right thing from the ground up. What a wonderful world.

rebolek

[16:35](#msg5b2a82666ceffe4eba1cf203) &gt; force them to learn the wrong models

It would be interesting to get some data how many people have now preconception of \*variables* and how many would find this abstraction useful as first step in introduction to Redbol.

9214

[16:37](#msg5b2a82dc7da8cd7c8c595271)@rebolek "You can call this a variable, with a minor caveat which we'll cover in the next sections" (or something like that) is not the same as "This is a variable. Permanent."

[16:42](#msg5b2a83de72b31d3691dd0dcd)Maybe, maybe not. If people take responsibility to educate the others, I expect them, at the very minimum, to be confident in what they say.

[16:44](#msg5b2a8468d2abe4668874df62)Besides, I don't see the point in yet another tutorial on the basics, we already have a plethora of them. Wouldn't it be better to concentrate documentation efforts in one place instead of spreading thinly over the surface?

Do we, really? Every single one helps, IMO.

[16:50](#msg5b2a85b9ad21887018cb1ff4)Also I believe that people who are writing basic tutorials now are the same people who will write advanced tutorials tomorrow. Or who do you think is going to write them?

9214

[16:50](#msg5b2a85f1aeb8fa0c072c8bc1)So why not to learn and write advanced tutorials in the first place?

[16:52](#msg5b2a8655d2abe4668874e522)I recall myself as a newbie - all the basic tutorials weren't really helpful (in some parts even harmful), resources were all scattered and disorganized, so I came in this chat and started to ask questions.

[16:55](#msg5b2a86f17da8cd7c8c595cb8)If we talk about 'newcomers to Red', not about 'newcomers to programming'. For the latter I guess it's ok, but then I'd recommended more mainstream language instead.

rebolek

[16:57](#msg5b2a87835862c35f47b50ecf)Some people may prefer a tutorial that will help them to star immediately instead of spending time on chat and I certainly respect that.  
Web purists may disdain w3schools.com but it certainly helped me find answers quickly instead on spending time on HTML, CSS and JS forums.

9214

[16:58](#msg5b2a87d16ceffe4eba1cff80)And it will be you and me who will sit here and write text-walls of explanations to yet another 'oh why my variable is X' or 'oh what does &lt;foo has no value&gt; means', or even 'why my array grows over time if I initialize it on each call'.

rebolek

[17:00](#msg5b2a88440168e70c08d6ceec)For newcomers to Red, using \*variables* in tutorial is fine, because they are used to them. For newcomers to programing, it's more dangerous. And suggesting more mainstream language is basically elitism, Redbol is partially based on Logo, an educational language, I taught Rebol to 10 years old children, why should newcomers avoid it?

9214

[17:01](#msg5b2a88825862c35f47b511e6)And that happens because second graders teach first graders how to write things that should be written only if you're in the highschool (in some cases only if you have a PhD).

[17:03](#msg5b2a88d4d2abe4668874edc8)@rebolek

&gt; For newcomers to Red, using variables in tutorial is fine

It certainly wasn't fine for me. Re-learning everything from the ground up was rather painful and time-consuming.

[17:05](#msg5b2a89727d3bca737af5f300)&gt; why should newcomers avoid it

Because there could be no way back to the traditional mainstream programming ;)

If Red is you first language, you can go back only to ignorance ;)

[17:18](#msg5b2a8c61960fcd4eb9108566)But you may, say, re-evaluate your choice of career path and don't go into back-end to code in Java as you initially planned.

[17:31](#msg5b2a8f557d3bca737af60292)I don't know, honestly. Maybe for someone notion of variables can serve as a trampoline, but for me it was a pitfall. So all I try to do is to help others to avoid the same fate. But if you call me an elitist and a pedant for doing so, then I'd rather spend my time elsewhere. Basic tutorials are fine when they give you a headstart, but not when they push you back from the starting line.

[17:40](#msg5b2a9178ad21887018cb3e42)Though, it all depends on how far you want to run. For someone who uses Red on a whim as yet another scripting language to film VB-style horror shows - sure, variables, arrays, even OOP will do. Because who cares?

[18:00](#msg5b2a96460168e70c08d6f651)&gt; re-evaluate your choice of career path and don't go into back-end to code in Java as you initially planned

For better or worse, if Red succeeds, we'll have 1% of people that know the inner details, 10% skilled developers, and 90% (pardon my rounding) semi- or non-programmers.

We know there are implementation details that make Red different, but words \*are* variables. It's a shortcut term that we shouldn't shy away from entirely. Noting how Red is different will sometimes be important, but a lot of people could use Red effectively without ever getting beyond the basic idea. And that's OK. People need context, too, based on where they're coming from.

As for the problem of writing documentation when you're not an expert, that's a tough one. Even experts will make mistakes and lots of them, that's human.

I'd recommend Python, C# if you want to develop games (Unity), and as your second language JavaScript because everyone needs to know that one. Not as the first language though, because JavaScript.

I do think the GUI features of Red and Rebol could make it a perfect beginner language in some ways, you just get a much bigger feeling of achievement when you see a window on the screen instead of just text. I think that's why JavaScript is so easy and fun to learn

cryptowyrm

[21:03](#msg5b2c12ac7d3bca737aff086d)Clock demos seem to be getting common, Elm has one too.

[21:07](#msg5b2c13857d3bca737aff0b3e)The live coding aspect of the clock demo is something I'd encourage people to spend more time on to make Red more appealing. I've really gotten in love with live coding from ClojureScript + Reagent and Dart + Flutter (Android). Seeing an app being created while you write the code is just an amazing productivity boost. The Tweetdeck code I wrote using live coding and I wrote a Tweetdeck clone before, in JQuery + CoffeeScript. The difference was astonishing.

[21:19](#msg5b2c1673ad21887018d2e028)Will do, last time it happened when I was editing a parse rule, might be able to reproduce it next time I fiddle around with it

greggirwin

[21:21](#msg5b2c16e17da8cd7c8c61ad19)Live coding `parse` is a tool we want to write. Some of the possible problems there are obvious. Also, with live coding in a simple example, it's akin to Smalltalk, and you can change the system dynamically, which is obviously powerful and dangerous.

cryptowyrm

[21:23](#msg5b2c176aaeb8fa0c0735158b)Yeah, it will be interesting to see how far Red can go with this. One of the reasons that ClojureScript is so good at live coding is that it has no mutable state, or rather, all mutable state is encapsulated in atoms. In Red, you can mutate state all over the place, so making it fool proof is going to be tough, but could potentially be much more powerful.

[21:27](#msg5b2c182c5862c35f47bc3d31)I don't know how live coding is enabled by immutability though. It may make some things safer, but they are orthogonal features, yes?

[18:33](#msg5b2d4105d2abe4668880bde3)@greggirwin  
"Interesting @JacobGood1. It that a new relative of NewSpeak?"  
He has just made that comment in the past, he is not working on an immutable first language. Newspeak seems to be the only language of interest for him lately, however, that interested seems to have waned as well.  
@cryptowyrm I agree about Dart, that language could have been a lot better, at least they have flutter. It appears Google is making a new os in which Dart is the premiere language. Kind of like C# is to Windows.

[18:35](#msg5b2d41827d3bca737a01cc13)Last time I played around with Dart I liked a few features of the language; optional types, mixins, and all objects are interfaces(ties in with mixins well).

cryptowyrm

[18:45](#msg5b2d43e56ceffe4eba294337)@JacobGood1 Yeah, Fuchsia OS. Flutter is really great, because of the hot swapping live coding (which shows that it can be done in languages with mutable state). And since it works a lot like Facebook's react it's also very easy to use. Compared to Java Android development especially, where you've got abstractions wrapped in abstractions covered in abstraction sauce :)

JacobGood1

[18:50](#msg5b2d4507ad21887018d5965f)Languages have had hot swap/interactive programming abilities since forever... Common Lisp, SmallTalk, etc. Heck, even Java has had it for some time with Jrebel.

cryptowyrm

[18:56](#msg5b2d4660467bd7268c2b1169)Yeah Lisp and Smalltalk are famous for that and those languages are many decades old. With Lisp there is this old story how a rocket from Nasa was saved because they changed the app live while it was running on the rocket in space. It does seem to be rarely used though, it only now gets popular from what I've seen. I never used it on a real, big project before starting to program in ClojureScript with the Reagent React wrapper.

For example large libraries that does not function and where the programming job becomes a mess of time consuming irresponsebility. The horizont that things can be done easier and with more fun.

You will be surprized most languages make so much trouble only to create such a simple window. There are a lot of code lines.

greggirwin

[22:37](#msg5bad5bbd8196693171c61a0a)@bferris413 as @9214 shows, `compose` is the way to do this inline. To build larger GUIs programmatically, it's common to create a base layout block and `append` content to that, then `view` it.

9214

[23:05](#msg5bad623041177e0bc7b8f389)@bferris413 here's a more detailed explanation, so you get the idea and the way of thinking:

```
view ...
```

We know that `view` accepts a VID block, with description of graphical interface. Note that VID block is still a block, and this means that we can do whatever we want with it before `view` takes its turn. So, we know that we want to inline some dynamically generated data in that block, which is what `compose` usually does:

```
view compose [...]
```

Okay, good. `compose` will evaluate any parentheses inside a block - this is where our data will reside. We know in advance that our data should be displayed as a column, so I'll just add a `below` VID keyword on top, to force vertical layout:

```
view compose [below (...)]
```

Great, now, how do we generate our labels? The first ingridient is a list of months, which Red already has:

```
>> system/locale/months
== ["January" "February" "March" "April" "May" "June" "July" "August" "September" "October" "November" "December"]
```

Next step is to take each of these strings and wrap it into `text`. A naive solution will most likely contain a `foreach` or `forall` loop with `append` and pre-allocated block, but we can do this a bit more elegantly with `collect`:

```
>> collect [repeat i 5 [keep i]]
== [1 2 3 4 5]
```

`collect` works really simple - it takes a block of code and evaluates it, but `keep`s (pun intended) any intermediate results which are marked with `keep` word.

```
>> collect [foreach month system/locale/months [keep month]]
== ["January" "February" "March" "April" "May" "June" "July" "August" "September" "October" "November" "December"]
```

But this is useless, as it returns the exact same block. We actually need to `keep` `text` portion. So we need to do `keep [text month]`, but we also need to actually embed a string inside, not a `month` word: `keep reduce ['text month]`. A tick before `'text` makes sure that `'text` will evalute to `text` word.

We're all set now!

```
>> inline: [collect [foreach month system/locale/months [keep reduce ['text month]]]]
== [collect [foreach month system/locale/months [keep reduce ['text month]]]]
>> view compose [below (do inline)]
```

[18:25](#msg5bb1150f5af48530683e9fe1)It has never been added to Rebol, and was surely considered for Red.

[20:35](#msg5bb13377bbdc0b2505c7469a)BTW there is a trade-off between making words into lit-words (for reduce/deep) and expressions into parens (for compose). It would depend on the volumes of these two categories.

[02:31](#msg5bb81e9e1c100a4f2939e8a1)@greggirwin that's easy way? `push: :append/only` looks easier than `push: func [value][append/only value]` - and supporting other refinement!s like `/part` and `/dup` will make the code even longer and more complicated.

[06:17](#msg5bb85363c08b8b3067ddc553)I am a proponent of having stacks grow at the \_front_ instead of the \_back\_. Then push becomes simply `insert`, and pop becomes `remove` or `take`.

9214

[06:23](#msg5bb854d982893a2f3ba90a50)Except that it's (1) `insert/only` (2) less effective, as you need to move allocated portion on each insertion, instead of just extending it at the tail.

[06:23](#msg5bb854fd1c100a4f293b0c89)This discussion is about possible aliasing feature, not stacks or someone's preferences.

meijeru

[06:35](#msg5bb857cc64cfc273f9a2cd37)I see. So I have unwittingly started a new (hopefully not un-interesting) discussion about stacks. To me it is a case of efficiency vs. readability and less chance of mistakes. `remove back tail` I have always found awkward. Anyone else feels the same?

rebolek

[06:42](#msg5bb85959435c2a518e5c8532)`remove back tail` is bit awkward, but you can do `take/last`.

9214

[06:42](#msg5bb85969bbdc0b2505f3af5d)I don't follow your argument. In any case, such operations over block are abstracted away with `push` and `pop`, which you can either create with wrappers:

```
pop: func [stack][remove back tail stack]
```

or with "aliases":

```
pop: :take/last
```

With implementation encapsulated in such generic operators, you always write `push stack value` and `pop stack` or similar, so there's no concern about readability.

meijeru

[06:50](#msg5bb85b1e82893a2f3ba92e0d)So you introduce another inefficiency: the overhead of a function call :smirk\_cat: . I take your point though, about abstracting away.

[06:55](#msg5bb85c68ae7be940160c2325)So as long as the `pop: :take/last` solution is not available, the wrapper function will have to do.

[07:01](#msg5bb85dd96e5a401c2d249c05)This was just an example off top of my head, to show what users (and especially novices) may expect from using `get-path!` on a refined function. Such aliasing of functions with refinements is a reccuring theme, which pops (pun intended) up here once in a while, and so is worth to be discussed.

I don't understand why you took emphasis on stacks / readability / efficency whatever, as it wasn't the point.

[01:47](#msg5bc3f198c7bf7c366211b116)@bferris413 please see if there's already a ticket for that. If not, file one. It affects blocks too. `Put` is the culprit there, but you don't need it.

```
>> v: [a "1"]
== [a "1"]
>> append v 'b
== [a "1" b]
>> v/b: "2"
*** Script Error: value out of range: 2
*** Where: set-path
*** Stack:
```

Note that block types are not specifically key-value structures, so they don't auto-expand. A `map!` will do what you want though. If you know you're always going to use blocks that way, add a value placeholder:

```
>> v: [a "1"]
== [a "1"]
>> repend v ['b none]
== [a "1" b none]
>> v/b: "2"
== "2"
>> v

[16:45](#msg5bcb5bc16e5a401c2da1d239)@greggirwin @rebolek Well. Gave up on .NET for rapid prototyping. Excel is no longer an option now that we are on Azure, so I am writing my charts in REBOL (not Google Charts) and putting them in a VID display. Will be up to the .NET boys to implement once we've tested the prototype.

[16:46](#msg5bcb5be5ae7be940168aaa12)I remember that Carl implemented charts for contract with a large chip manufacturer back in the day. Wondering what happened to that code.

[16:47](#msg5bcb5c391c100a4f29b8178c)I write code to express my ideas, which is very different than writing code for others to use, so my charts will need massaging from a real computer science guru to be useful.

greggirwin

[18:47](#msg5bcb7850c7bf7c366241f702)@SutherlandSM there was a quite extensive charting lib written by a Rebol community member: http://www.rebol.org/view-script.r?script=q-plot.r and @rgchris has a Google charts API (not sure if it's still supported).

[19:04](#msg5bcb7c50435c2a518eda7f35)Reactivity has nothing to do with event loop.

[19:04](#msg5bcb7c591c100a4f29b8e89d)It's separate concept.

SutherlandSM

[19:06](#msg5bcb7ca0435c2a518eda8316)Good. Interested to know how it is being implemented in the REBOL/Red world.

[19:06](#msg5bcb7cb31c100a4f29b8e9ec)I have done some state machines, but they depended on the event loop.

rebolek

[19:07](#msg5bcb7cf91c100a4f29b8ebb7)@SutherlandSM here's an example from red-lang.org :

```
red>> a: make reactor! [x: 1 y: 2 total: is [x + y]]
    == make object! [
        x: 1
        y: 2
        total: 3
    ]
    red>> a/x: 5
    == 5
    red>> a/total
    == 7
    red>> a/y: 10
    == 10
    red>> a/total
    == 15
```

[19:09](#msg5bcb7d77600c5f6423dea046)And when `total` is some GUI element instead of variable, GUI changes it's state, just by changing some value elsewhere.

SutherlandSM

[19:10](#msg5bcb7dafab17df2631c31793)So word state change triggers a function. Something like what view/faces did when initializing, but this does it at runtime. So reactor! is a data-type or something else.

[22:29](#msg5bce4f2d1c100a4f29ca67e7)@SutherlandSM we're also going to add a message, very soon, so you know it's compiling the console on first run. The next step after that will be to reverse the roles, so the download will be the console, and the toolchain will be secondary, when you want to compile.

[23:10](#msg5bd4f05082893a2f3b4e35fd)Why might Red not include some filenames read from a directory? Example:

```
files: read %/c/windows/system32/
```

I can find `doskey.exe` in `files` but the on-screen keyboard `osk.exe` isn't in the block.

My first thought was permission, but they both have the same permissions.

I am on an admin user account and `osk.exe` is in `files` from your example

[07:54](#msg5bd56b2bab17df263101ce03)@ne1uno After some research, it appears I am getting the files from the `C:\Windows\SysWOW64` directory which is a folder for 32 bit Windows binaries on Windows 64 bit. Similar to how there is `C:\Program Files` for 64 bit programs, and `C:\Program Files (x86)` for 32 bit programs.

[08:01](#msg5bd56ce6ab17df263101d7e1)I don't know the intricate details but I think since Red is 32-bit, it runs on the Window's 32-bit emulator on Win 64 which transparently uses the `SysWOW64` folder instead of the `System32` folder which is only for 64-bit binaries on 64-bit Windows.

Yesterday following (seemingly) a bug, I tried red-08nov18-06ddce9e.exe . It ran once, then no more. And red-02oct18-c00c57b1.exe stopped running too. That seemed to be related to AVG's "sandbox" (running newly compiled file in a secure environment while checking it). So I completely uninstalled AVG, cleaned related registry entries, no way: GUI console is compiled, but does not launch.  
Only the latest official build red-063.exe still works. Any hint?

As the previous automatic build stopped working, and the 08nov18 one also stopped yesterday after working for a while, it's like something (windows update?) changed that makes recent versions crash. I don't know how to get a log / diagnose the crash...

greggirwin

[18:56](#msg5bf06465a47c6c5d3bff5046)@TheOnlyArtz if you read through the entries at red-lang.org, you can see a lot of examples. We have basic I/O, which lets you do a lot, but low level (full I/O) is slated for 0.7.0, as was said. We'd love to estimate delivery dates, but have to roll with the punches, which makes that nearly impossible. As we're still Alpha, Red is great for experimenting, learning, and thinking in new ways, but stable enough for a lot of real work too. 0.6.4 will make the GC official, but automated builds have it already, which makes a lot of things easier to not worry about. :^)

The best thing to do is try it out, and see if you like it. It's different in many ways, and not for everyone.

greggirwin

[20:14](#msg5bf46b37f59704348ed8f98e)@lpvm you can see that the error comes in `load`ing the value, which is separate from evaluation (that `attempt` will catch). `attempt/safer` also doesn't catch it. A couple alternatives:

```
>> attempt [make date! [2019 02 29]]
== none
```

```
>> load/trap "date? a: 29-02-2019"
== [[date? a:] "29-02-2019" make error! [
    code: 349
    type: 'script

There can be a bigger discussion on loadability and literal values, if needed.

endo64

[21:51](#msg5bf481d7e25cc27405191cf7)@lpvm `29-02-2019` should be loaded correctly, if it comes from a file or similar external source then it will be a string, hence you can catch:

```
>> attempt [date? a: load "29-02-2019"]
== none
>> attempt [date? a: load "22-02-2019"]
== true
```

lpvm

[23:04](#msg5bf49317ced7003fe15d0dac)Thank you for the explanation and the solution @greggirwin and @endo64 . I think I've never used `load` for strings before. As a general rule, for strings, when should `load` be used?

## Wednesday 21st November, 2018

greggirwin

[00:05](#msg5bf4a147cfa682348d5aaac8)`Load` is a safe operation, even on untrusted data, though we should always test and ensure that. All it should do is transcode a string of data (text or binary) into Red values. Anytime you get user input (including from other devs in extensible systems), it's going to be in one of those forms. That makes `load` your first friend in dialect processing, because then you can `parse` at the block level.

With Red, there is almost never a single way to do things, as with some other langs. `load/trap` is really powerful, in that you can tell whether an error occurred at all, and point people to the problem. Much easier than trying to do all the parsing on the string yourself.

[00:05](#msg5bf4a15bed6bcf1ef835070a)It can also be incorporated in tools, to syntax check on the fly.

endo64

[06:51](#msg5bf50063958fc53895c5e430)@lpvm When you `load` a string you will have a block of values, those values are words (like `my-word`, `print`, `:call`, `tuple!`) and literals (like `42`, `"my strig"`, `1.2.3.4`, `0.5`, `some@one.com` etc.), and the words in your loaded block can either have values as well, for example `print` is a word with a function (native) value, and `tuple!` is a word that has a value of a `datatype!`.

So you can execute (evaluate) your loaded block (if you trust it), or parse it, or use that block to create values in your script (like a configuration file etc.)

```
>> load "print [3 * 5 some@one.com]"
== [print [3 * 5 some@one.com]]   ; here we have a block with words & values only, two words print and *, two literals 3 and 5, and one another literal which is an email
>> do load "print [3 * 5 some@one.com]"
>> do "print [3 * 5 some@one.com]"
15 some@one.com   ; do without load also loads the string (or file) before evaluating 

>> load "a: 1 b: 2"
== [a: 1 b: 2]   ;just two words a: & b:, and two literals 1 & 2, doesn't mean anything without a further process like parsing or evaluating
>> construct load "a: 1 b: 2"
== make object! [
    a: 1
    b: 2
]  ; now we have something more useful
```

So loadable strings are more valuable then ordinary strings :)

[04:10](#msg5bfe154cf59704348e1624e5)@gltewalt `text-list` does not need it, even if it accepts if specified. Other faces accept it too, but not all are showing scrollers. And those which are showing (e.g. `panel`, `rich-text`, `text`) need to specify `on-scroll` actor, and how to manipulate scroller face with its specific facets is undocumented too. So, I think for those we need to wait some explanation.

But for `drop-list` and `drop-down` it works out of the box. (On W10 at least. I have no info on other platforms.)

[13:54](#msg5bffef87cb32736b29b0bac0)In Rebol, I got an example of a `menu` bar:

```
menu-Options: ["About..." [alert "This menu is just a choice button widget :)"]

```

Reading the documentation can't find a way to implement a `menu` in Red.

lpvm

[13:59](#msg5bfff0a6f849b222e0c1af61)I don't know yet how to read that documentation. For example, why is there `view/options` and not `window` as in the title of the section?

9214

[14:00](#msg5bfff0edd24f9324d270f48a)Because window is a top-most container for other faces. And you should really learn about virtual tree of faces first.

lpvm

9214

[15:36](#msg5c0007877d26db1e83157873)@lpvm if we are talking about window menu, then you should extend `actor` facet with `on-menu` event handler. For other faces specifying `on-menu` handler in VID block should be enough.

lpvm

[15:42](#msg5c0008d8a115c91ef7b0a2ef)I agree with you that I have to really learn what is said in the documentation. But where is it said `on-menu` in the documentation of `view` or `VID`? Is it implicit?

Again, not sure what you mean by that. All info in View/VID documentation is explicit.

         open [probe "opening..."] 
         save [probe "saving..."]

9214

[15:55](#msg5c000be67074b9036874f719)@toomasv you can just go with `view/options [on-menu ...][menu: ...]`.

[13:35](#msg5c03dfa9c4af6856da7556cf)@novvorto\_twitter Parse rules are left-recursive and greedy. Meaning: the first rules always goes first, and if it can match, then it will match as much as it can.

In your example with `[int-pair | real-pair]`, for instance, `12` is recognized as an integer, and after that parsing fails, as there's nothing that can match `.2`.

[13:37](#msg5c03e00299ad1556dbf4d7d6)Basically, whenever you reach a real number it will fail, because integer part is consumed my `int-pair` rule, and decimal part cannot be matched because of leading `.`.

[18:47](#msg5c057a4ec4af6856da7f6b63)@lpvm you're welcome. As I said, Parse isn't really necessary here. You can always process string using native functions, even if it looks naive.

[14:03](#msg5c0689329f38cc0fd5a3192e)Why does this need partenthesis? `put singles cl-id (select singles cl-id) + 1`, since evaluation is left to right.

[14:04](#msg5c0689646c3c565096d181f1)Because `select` function will evaluate its arguments first

lpvm

rebolek

[14:06](#msg5c0689fc464b6c0fd68cf47f)Yeah, but `select` takes two arguments.

[14:07](#msg5c068a3c500e8e37285b61ca)And if you leave parenthesis out, `select` sees `select singles cl-id + 1`, which is `select (singles) (cl-id + 1)`.

lpvm

[14:08](#msg5c068a68bc1a693e3a5506db)yes, I know, that's why I asked. `+` takes precedence, then.

9214

[14:10](#msg5c068ad9e827492525993ec9)Operators have precedence over functions. Functions take as much expressions as they need, operators take one value on the left and one expression on the right.

shifts: parse input-txt [collect some collect [shift-date skip]]
probe shifts

9214

[16:00](#msg5c06a49ba6c29a1037e1fa4f)@lpvm are you sure that `input-txt` should be a block?

lpvm

[16:01](#msg5c06a4d99aec405095c71c6e)Yes, that's the result of a `read/lines %input.txt`

9214

[16:01](#msg5c06a4f0c4af6856da86cbb4)Why then do you parse block as if it's a string?

```

[16:04](#msg5c06a5901c439034af195be0)Again, step aside from Parse. You don't need it to extract something between `[` and ` `.

lpvm

[16:05](#msg5c06a5c848d021555aee1fbe)`into`, alright. Could `mold` it as well, right?

9214

lpvm

[16:07](#msg5c06a65f43c68b3727fbdc1d)`mold` the block, so that it becomes a string. Did it and it works.

9214

[16:08](#msg5c06a687464b6c0fd68dc241)... why then use `read/lines` if you instantly convert block back to string?

lpvm

[16:12](#msg5c06a7561c439034af196832)I'll explain it. For day 04 of AoC, I had the parse working fine for each line, after using `read` to import the input. Except that the input was not sorted. Had to use `read/lines` to then `sort`it. That's where the block took the place of the string.  
Now that things are in chronological order, as some lines are dependent (need information) on a line that is above, I can parse it and complete some lines with values of a previous line. `into` or `mold` do the job.  
Thanks both of you.

[16:34](#msg5c06ac8d9aec405095c758d8)Now, one step ahead. The first expression is parsed correctly, but the following are not.

```
input-txt: ["[1518-02-24 23:58] Guard #853 begins shift" "[1518-02-25 00:20] falls asleep" "[1518-02-25 00:43] wakes up"]

(1)]
rule: [collect some collect [into [shift-date space action skip opt txt]]]
shifts: parse input-txt txt: rule
```

Added the `txt:` before rule and added `opt txt` to `rule` but it's not working.

[12:06](#msg5c07bf4511bb5b2504681ced)@9214 Hi, regarding the solution you've presented yesterday, there's something I don't understand.  
What I've seen and done is `... into [rules]`. You've built something like `... into [one rule] [another rule] third rule` and the third rule is not in a block.  
Another thing is the first block of rules `[keep pick to end]`. I \[read](https://www.red-lang.org/2017/03/062-libred-and-macros.html) something about `pick` in `parse` context, but could never arrive at such formulation by myself based solely on that.  
Would you mind explaining all this?

9214

[12:09](#msg5c07c0041e86c308232d3b55)Can you elaborate on "not a block" part? As for `pick`, see \[here](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/\[DOC]-Guru-Meditations#parse-collectkeep-options-combined-with-tothru-rules). It basically collects matched values one-by-one instead of collecting matched group as a "unity".

lpvm

[12:31](#msg5c07c534f992693c7a266b25)It's getting more clear, now, but yet not fully bright...  
You've build `into [keep pick to end]`. To play with this, I tried `into [keep pick to ":" to end]` if the minute part of the time was not important. But returns `[]`.

[12:32](#msg5c07c55880986419d54236ce)Shouldn't it return everything up to the hour part?
