[09:33](#msg5a4a0077ba39a53f1ac267f5)commenting on the blog does not, for whatever reason, work for me, so will try here...if everything goes well according to the plans, is there any rough estimate when Red might have 64 support as well as Linux GUI back-end ready?

dockimbel

[10:29](#msg5a4a0d8868d092bb620f0129)@gour Reaching 64-bit support can be achieved in different ways, but in all cases, it would take at least 6 months to implement for the core team. Given the current priorities, it should not be expected before the end of the year. For the Linux GUI backend, it is partially implemented already in the GTK branch. Completing it requires finding at least on skilled developer willing to spend enough time on it. The ICO funding, if successful, could help a lot with that. It could also help partially for the 64-bit support, for example out-sourcing the changes in linker's output \[file formats](https://github.com/red/red/tree/master/system/formats) for adding 64-bit support.

dockimbel

[11:42](#msg5a4a1eb05355812e573bb5e0)@gour In such case, Red/C3 will drop low in priority, and we then focus on our core roadmap, and unroll our business plans as quickly as possible in order to reach the break even point. The ICO is a better path, not just for funding, but because the blockchain market is a big new opportunity for the Red stack, and we should seize it in order to grow up faster and much bigger. Moreover, introducing a token-based economy in the Red platform would open many new business opportunities, both for our company, and for the Red users.

soapdog

[18:02](#msg5a4bc91984fb74b9402cb78d)I think I found a bug with `call/output` repeated calls to it using the same local variable will append the content instead of replacing it...

```

[18:07](#msg5a4bca4fb48e8c356690b7c7)I thought that local in that case meant that \_the scope of that var was local and it was destroyed/initialized for each function call\_, I am of course wrong

9214

[18:08](#msg5a4bca97ba39a53f1aca5aff)@soapdog you're welcome. To put it shortly: all `series!` values are passed by a reference, even if it's assigned to some local word. If you don't want to modify original value and just want to work with its content, use `copy` or `copy/deep`.

soapdog

[18:10](#msg5a4bcafb5355812e57434c47)I wondered about all the `copy`s I have been seeing in sample code... now I understand.

[18:15](#msg5a4bcc305355812e5743525b)Clicking the \_load message_ button executes a shell call to `sbot` to pick the message, without that `copy` call, I would end up piling messages instead of refreshing the display, so you both saved me here, thanks.

[09:13](#msg5a4df04b5355812e574dd586)Yeah, I can imagine that. My feeling is, that many ppl want Core stuff to be as much complete, as it can be.

[11:16](#msg5a4e0d07b48e8c35669be9a6)Great article @dockimbel.  
But i wonder how much wonders an IDE can do for Red. Because at a time when every person has his/her favourite editor, why would people choose a newish IDE with probably different controls and looks than what they are used to.  
IMO it would be better to support Language Server Protocol and have good tooling support for searching and refactoring, and then the LSP would make it easy to integrate with most of the editors and everyone would be happy with their favourite editors.

IMHO reaching 1.0 is more important than expanding some capabilities of the language

userful developments, it will reach more popularity and attract new users.

pekr

[11:56](#msg5a4e1658ce68c3bc74799e36)Well, Rebol never had concurrency for e.g. I think that most ppl are waiting for GC and full IO (ports). Then it could be regarded as being Rebol comparable to start with. Some ppl might object, but who knows what's better. I for one don't care about the 1.0 moniker at all. For e.g. I am using Inkscape, which is still not at 1.0 after xy years of its development. For me, all is important is the feature completness and stability.

are1000

[11:58](#msg5a4e16cd29ec6ac311b9929b)@pekr at the same time, reasonable IO requires some kind of asynchrony handling, and so on and so forth. It's hard to decide what will make the language complete.

[12:12](#msg5a4e1a4b0163b02810af91e3)@dockimbel - is there any plan of how to aproach networking protocols? Will Red use native platform functionality, where available, to not reinvent the wheel and have complete protocol support, whereas allowing also low level sockets, including some tweakings like naggle algho settings, etc.?

dockimbel

[12:14](#msg5a4e1a9503838b2f2a6cf7cf)@pekr Besides HTTP/S, OS are not offering much in that area, so we will probably have to implement most of high-level protocols ourselves.

Ivo-Balbaert

[13:12](#msg5a4e28565355812e574f1045)I am also all in favor for a v1.0 after simple GC+IO+Ports (networking). v1.0 means: good enough to start using it for serious projects. It should not mean: feature complete with all bells and whistles. In the latter case a language will never be ready, in these quickly changing times. Go and Rust have benefited enormously from declaring v1.0. And there is the sad story of Nim, an awesome language but which stays unknown and unpopular due to a policy of wanting to be perfect and complete.  
v1.0 will bring much publicity and many new people to Red, and the start of commercial projects around Red. And if Red/C3 takes off, this will be an awesome killer app to accompany Red v1.0!

ghost~5680c5f416b6c7089cc058a5

[13:14](#msg5a4e28b468d092bb62226bde)I would also like to have a module system for 1.0 release. Because a decent module system implies a decent package and build manager which implies easy to use external libs.

[13:35](#msg5a4e2d9103838b2f2a6d6038)do you consider that module system is a \*\*must\** for writing bigger apps with Red?

[13:37](#msg5a4e2e08232e79134dc5e37f)Yes, I do.  
I don't have much programming experience but the little bit of experience I have in C and Rust, I can say that \*\*Cargo\** is really a blessing. Compiling external C libs especially on Windows is a PITA.

[13:38](#msg5a4e2e4fba39a53f1ad6344b)Another point is that navigating code of any project written in Rust is much easier than navigating C code because I know exactly how the files would be structured.

BeardPower

[13:39](#msg5a4e2ea0b48e8c35669c9740)I second @nc-x

It would be easier to develop plugins, when modules are supported. Plugins are easy to code with Red, but it would be nice, if there was some possibility to load compiled code, like a dll, so plugins can be shared without the sourcecode and the plugin code being decompilaton-safe.

For me, full I/O is more important than concurrency at the moment. Memory mapped files, TCP etc.

rebolek

[13:40](#msg5a4e2ee70163b02810b00421)It would be nice to have modules, but it would be even nicer to have 1.0. They are not crucial part.

pekr

[13:43](#msg5a4e2f9dce68c3bc747a2ae7)Isn't there a risk releasing Red/C3 without the language in fact being declared as at least 1.0? From the PR point of view for e.g.?

BeardPower

[13:45](#msg5a4e2ff6edd2230811103106)Well, from what I understand, Red/C3 is for coding smart contracts. For this, Red is feature complete.  
So it could be releases as 1.0.

[13:46](#msg5a4e304fba39a53f1ad641f7)I know I'm new to Red, but I've used Rebol for a long time. What was and still is a showstopper for me is the language missing a genuine cross-platform sound capability.

[13:47](#msg5a4e308729ec6ac311ba2764)@pekr first alpha of Red/C3 is planned at the end of Q1, so I guess that in time for v1.0 of C3, there will be also Red v1.0.

pekr

[13:52](#msg5a4e319c232e79134dc5f744)@rebolek not unless rescheduled. 1.0 counts on concurrency, modules, io IIRC. It cant be done. Not even full IO imo.

[17:24](#msg5a4e6342b48e8c35669dcc1c)@arcanosam\_twitter That sounds like a lot of work.

[17:25](#msg5a4e6380b48e8c35669dcd3b)but to actually \_compile_ Red to WASM would require someone to basically re-write a part of the compiler from the ground up to support that as a target

ocket8888

maximvl

[21:37](#msg5a4e9e91ce68c3bc747ca360)the underlying level doesn't matter much, afaik there are implementations on both tcp and udp

ocket8888

[21:38](#msg5a4e9ef1edd223081112c456)I would think udp would make mounting filesystems a hassle, since with tcp you could just expect the file contents in order, whereas with udp you could be missing chunks or getting them out-of-order

maximvl

[21:39](#msg5a4e9f0e29ec6ac311bcb1e0)well, yeah, this needs to be solved by developer in case of UDP

[21:40](#msg5a4e9f3dedd223081112c5ab)well in that case I wouldn’t be caught dead using a udp implementation. It’s much easier when part of my work is done for me

maximvl

[21:40](#msg5a4e9f5ece68c3bc747ca778)what matters is the idea to provide file interface to anything

ocket8888

[21:46](#msg5a4ea0a2edd223081112cc12)actually, how would that work? you can store local copies of the files - which will work on every OS but will cost you loads of disk space, processing time, and RAM, plus you’d need to constantly poll files for updates - or you can make your own file system like `sshfs` does that handles a lot of these problems for you, by fetching copies of the files for RAM instead of on actual disk and passing diffs back and forth on writes, which can be monitored asynchronously since you made your own fs, but that only works on systems that support fuser filesystems, which is just linux natively. Mac and Windows will have external dependencies.

maximvl

[21:47](#msg5a4ea0d5ce68c3bc747cae57)no, you are thinking about files

[21:47](#msg5a4ea0e75355812e5751f5eb)9P is file-like interface

[21:47](#msg5a4ea10d5355812e5751f69f)there is no copying and storing, it's just providing access to resources

ocket8888

[21:50](#msg5a4ea1b8232e79134dc88ef0)but the wiki page said it exposed the file objects through the filesystem, and the only way I can think of that working is if they made a filesystem that’s similar to sshfs or netfs

maximvl

[21:51](#msg5a4ea1ce0163b02810b29ac7)it is similar to `sshfs` in how it looks, yes

[21:51](#msg5a4ea1ef232e79134dc88fd4)but `sshfs` only transports regular files over `ssh`, here it's completely different

ocket8888

[21:52](#msg5a4ea221bd369bc824879146)Alright, well godspeed my man. I’m just waiting for websockets, then Red will do everything I could ask of it.

maximvl

[21:53](#msg5a4ea261ce68c3bc747cb48e)9P is not a transport (though it can be) it's a way to provide access to resources with file API, eg your monitor can be represented by a two dimensional array with pixel color coding, file interface would allow you to write and read it

[21:53](#msg5a4ea26b03838b2f2a701687)so you can easily share it across any hosts

[21:54](#msg5a4ea2820163b02810b29df9)and you don't need VNC or other specific programs

[21:55](#msg5a4ea2c2ba39a53f1ad8d064)same with networks - plan 9 had no routing or stuff, you could mount server's network interfaces into your machine and programs would just use them as local ones transparently

[21:56](#msg5a4ea2fcba39a53f1ad8d233)any number of examples, all IPC and cross-machine things were replaced by a single protocol

ocket8888

[21:58](#msg5a4ea399ce68c3bc747cbba6)I think you can actually sort-of do the monitor one, although I’m not 100% certain how Wayland and X11 actually work. My guess is they are manipulating the framebuffer, and if that’s the case, you could set the read permissions on it such that it’s readable by someone on a trusted host via `read/binary tcp://pcThatIsSharingItsMonitor:someport/dev/fb`

[06:50](#msg5a4f20385355812e57540dcc)I fixed functions. It honestly works pretty well for really basic, top-level declarations.  
I need to do some work with stack manipulation to get highlighting inside inner blocks working, and I’m having trouble with the function call syntax. It seems pretty impossible to tell when the argument list ends if it’s not within a block, no?

rebolek

[06:52](#msg5a4f20a9232e79134dcaa4db)@ocket8888 you would need to count arguments from function's definition, if that's possible

ocket8888

[06:58](#msg5a4f21feba39a53f1adaba88)it’s not really practical. The number of arguments a function takes then isn’t really a part of the syntax, it’s more a consequence of execution, which means in order to be effective I’d essentially need to implement an entire parser.

[06:58](#msg5a4f2208232e79134dcaaa98)It’ll take some thought

[06:58](#msg5a4f223103838b2f2a721e52)or I could require that all lists of more than one argument to a function call be wrapped in a block, but that seems hacky since it’s not actually enforced by the grammar

9214

[06:59](#msg5a4f225529ec6ac311bed8fe)or you can drop that feature entirely, since it won't work for all cases anyway

ocket8888

9214

ocket8888

[07:03](#msg5a4f233fb48e8c3566a15017)I could probably do it for builtins, but not for user-defined functions

[07:03](#msg5a4f234029ec6ac311bedcd6)like in C, if you wrote `int a = somefunc(arg, “constant arg”)`, you’d see `somefunc` hilighted in blue in the default theme. But in Red, if I have `somefunc somearg maybefunc maybearg`, you don’t know if that’s two function calls with one arg each or one function call with three args. It could even be 4 `does` blocks. So I can’t know what to highlight without parsing the file to figure out the definitions of those words.

9214

[07:04](#msg5a4f237bb48e8c3566a1512f)or you can have `[somefunc somearg maybefunc maybearg]` which isn't a function call at all ;)

[07:05](#msg5a4f239d03838b2f2a722672)language is extremely flexible, all you can do IMO is to highlight builtins

[12:23](#msg5a4f6e590505ad8b45b9b785)@are1000 Words and contexts are not variables and scopes, like in other languages. `func` allows you to declare local words manually. There is no algorithm which can determine with certainty which words should be bound to the function context and which should not, so `function` needs to be greedy in its behavior. That can trip you up if you are not fully aware of the way it works.

[12:52](#msg5a4f7520b48e8c3566a2e47c)@are1000 Reactors are built on the ability for Red objects to track changes or deep changes. Such property is activated automatically when you provide a `on-change*` or `on-deep-change*` handler inside the object. See "Detecting changes in objects" in this \[article](http://www.red-lang.org/2014/12/050-objects-support.html). Though, it's not fully documented yet. You can find some examples in the Red codebase.

@InvoiceFox, nice to see you. No Patreon right now.

@nc-x, refactoring is tricky in a language like Red, yes? Could do simple things, but maybe there are new ways we can think to help aid development and improvement in code. It's important, and refactoring may play a role.

Design of the package and module system is key. Important? Yes. Required for real use? No. Red will do more for PitL than Rebol, but I've built significant Rebol systems without too many issues. I want PitL tools too though.

Welcome to Red @arcanosam\_twitter!

Red and some others try to help hide the details, but it can be disastrous if you want to work with money accurately. Most modern languages use float, but don't have a money type, it's clear they think people don't need that, relying on extra libs and such.

[18:17](#msg5a4fc1450505ad8b45bb94e3)There are historical reasons Red doesn't issue line numbers, but we may write tools that do. We could show them now, but they will only be useful in basic code (I know, a lot of code is basic). Once you start moving things around, making stuff dynamically, etc. line numbers cease to have meaning when going to the source of an error, so we need new and better ways to help with that.

[23:54](#msg5a5161ce03838b2f2a7c770a)Thoughts welcome on #3190. I don't use `alter/toggle` much, but it \*can* be a very handy function. To use it safely, you do need to understand it a bit. The new version I posted in the ticket improves some things but is \*not* directly compatible with the current implementation. Should be better, IMO, but will break tests that vet the existing behavior exactly. Doubtful it will break any real code though, even old R2 code.

A remaining, open question is what the return value should be. Returning the toggle state is good, in that you have to do more work to find that out otherwise, but how \*useful* is that result, compared with returning the altered input for chaining purposes?

@rebolek Smaller? I'm just not used to Schrödinger's values. I prefer the Lua's approach. It's simpler:

```
Acc.f = nil
 Acc.b = 7
 Acc.b

 if (Acc.b) then print("yes") end
 if (Acc.f) then print("yes")else print("nope") end
for i,v in pairs(Acc) do print(v) end

[20:31](#msg5a5283990505ad8b45c6f171)@GiuseppeChillemi, it's not up to the authors whether you can republish, but the publisher.

[20:42](#msg5a52861fb48e8c3566b02416)`Pad` design question. Strings are used as-is, and modified. All other values (including other any-string types) are `form`ed. Is this desirable? There are pros and cons either way. On the plus side, you can mod strings you already have, which may be very useful at times. The downside is that it may lead to very subtle behavioral differences that are hard to track down.

toomasv

[20:50](#msg5a528821232e79134dd9892b)I think it is desirable, considering the "minimal loss of information" principle. It is just the matter of deeply digesting the necessity of `copy` when needed. But if it is `copied` without question, the possibility of in-place modification is lost.

9214

[20:58](#msg5a5289edce68c3bc748d4d36)hard to track down :point\_right: read up about `copy`

[20:59](#msg5a528a2db48e8c3566b036c1)either way, you can always add additional refinement for another option

greggirwin

[21:03](#msg5a528b3f290a1f45615e2ac0)It's not so bad in simple cases. The issue I see is where things are passing through other things and you don't always know the type. Since it can work on any type, code using `pad` should really use `form`, not `copy`, yes? That is, if you want to be safe.

I'm thinking about this in the larger context of `format` as well.

[21:05](#msg5a528ba3290a1f45615e2d22)Modding in place is one of those things I can feel a bit uncomfortable about at times, but use a lot. So it's not about \*not* doing that, but how to make sure I don't do it unintentionally.

nedzadarek

[15:20](#msg5a538c36ce68c3bc7491f7bb)Parse's core principles are:  
\* Advance input series by matching grammar rules until top-level rule failure (returning false) or input exhaustion (returning true). (\*)  
\* Ordered choices (e.g. in \["a" | "ab"] rule, the second one will never succeed).  
\* Rules composability (unlimited).  
\* Limited backtracking: only input and rules positions are backtracked, other changes remain.  
\* Two modes: string-parsing (for example: external DSL) or block-parsing (for example: embedded DSL).

(\*) If collect keyword is used in any rule in its simplest form, a block will be returned by parse no matter if the root rule succeeded or not.

[17:51](#msg5a5a470e6117191e615fdd72)@abdllhygt homoiconicity is a property of some high-level programming languages (and Red too!), which means that there's no distinction between code and data

[17:53](#msg5a5a47865a9ebe4f7581e657)for example, we have a block, the basic building structure of Red language

```
>> block: [1 + 2]
== [1 + 2]
```

which we can treat as a piece of data and do some manipulations with it

```
>> reverse block
== [2 + 1]
>> append block [- 3]
== [2 + 1 - 3]
>> block/2: '*
== *
>> block
== [2 * 1 - 3]
```

but since there's no distinction between code and data, this block can be evaluated with special `do` function and produce a result

```
>> do block
== -1

[15:30](#msg5a5b777e517037a212a59777)@BeardPower You can call C code from Red/System. You can also call c# code from from c/c++. Here (https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/695387/Calling-Csharp-NET-methods-from-unmanaged-C-Cplusp) is a link to doing the later. If you take the last step and add a Red layer to it, you might get something working. ( I haven't tried this, but would be interested in the result.)

[15:31](#msg5a5b77cd290a1f456189161a)https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4428267/calling-c-sharp-from-c this list some more resources for you.

BeardPower

[15:32](#msg5a5b77f2ba39a53f1a1423e1)@BillDStrong Thanks for the links, but the issue is, that the ISV is using C# and they don't use/don't want to call any C code from their plugin architecture. So the plugins I may provide, need to be .Net assemblies.

BillDStrong

[15:34](#msg5a5b78951dcb91f1774c3d52)They don't want others to call their code from C? This just seems like they don't want you to do this.

BeardPower

[15:36](#msg5a5b7901ae53c15903e7b9ec)No, the other way round. They have some plugin architecture in place, which is only loading .Net assemblies and does not interface with C code.

[15:38](#msg5a5b79845ade18be3974fb36)They only want to deal with managed code.

BillDStrong

[15:39](#msg5a5b79bb517037a212a5a2d4)Have you heard of CLASP? They are a Common Lisp implementation which uses the pre-processor trick that Python uses to interface directly with c++ code. You could do something similar for .net, from the Red side.

[15:41](#msg5a5b7a265ade18be3974fe07)Can you make a managed wrapper around libRed.dll from C++? This might give you your access?

greggirwin

[16:33](#msg5a5b8640ba39a53f1a14644c)Doc's side project idea (and I have no idea what it really is) could be a .NET wrapper that goes over libRed. It's not a large API, so should be very doable. And if it grows, we can easily generate the C#/.NET code from Red once we have a model. The only problem, then, is someone needs to run an MS compiler, probably. Might be less work than a .NET back end, but means using something non-native to Red in the toolchain.

9214

BillDStrong

[16:37](#msg5a5b873bba39a53f1a1468d8)Wouldn't it be cleaner to make the CLR a compile target, such as X86? It woultn't require a separate compiler in that state, and would only require .net/core CLR, which anyone targeting the .net platform would need anyway.

[16:39](#msg5a5b87ccae53c15903e7fee5)Of course, this would raise questions about optimization later on, when Red gets to that step.

greggirwin

[16:45](#msg5a5b89341dcb91f1774c8bea)That means a new CLR back end, yes? That, to me, seems like a much bigger project than a wrapper.

[16:47](#msg5a5b89a65ade18be397542ac)However, is someone who wants this really knows their CLR generation, they should be able to work on that without conflict in any other area.

[07:31](#msg5a5daa5e1dcb91f1775686cd)@are1000, you'll find that some of us are wonderfully spoiled by having a stable language.

It will be the cost of success, and a much larger community.

They say that javascript is not a very nice language, thought it has improved a lot. But due to it's popularity I think there are lots of libraries with very nice apis. Sure a translator javascript to Red ( focusing on ES6 or/and TypeScript) should not be that hard. Well then a Red to JS compiler would be needed as well. That could bring a lot of people to the Red side. Maybe Foundation can finance a smart guy to venture there.

greggirwin

[23:03](#msg5a5e84ae5a9ebe4f75963fb5)Shock and awe. That's what I'm feeling. Yes, the ICO is part of that, but I've been meaning to read something a Red community member wrote, after glancing at the original version of the code some time back, and I just did. I'll tell you what it is in a minute. First, I want to say "Thanks!" to @9214, which isn't nearly enough.

I love Red, and the creative things people do with it. We talk a lot about dialects, and how Red lets us express ourselves differently. You've probably also heard of Literate Programming, and know it hasn't succeeded by our common definitions related to adoption. It's based on the idea of telling a story that has code inside it. At least it should have been. Usually it's more like a text book.

I've just seen an example of true literate programming.

I thought I would just breeze through it quickly, and get back to work, but I didn't. I started by being intrigued at some of the code, its style, its form. I didn't understand what it did, but I wanted to. Where were the comments telling me? In the story. So I read that, like a book. And it isn't just a great example of what literate programming could and should be, it's great storytelling. I read the whole thing, savoring it. It's a coming-of-age de-tech-tive mystery. And I think it speaks to the very spirit of Red.

Thank you @9214, with all my heart.

Curious? You should be.

That would have been a recipe for disaster. Investing into expensive features without any funding or business plan would have led to the end of the whole project. Such features cannot be "sold" as a product/service, nor can attract any investment money. So they need to be covered first by proper funding. And that is exactly what we just did.

[17:23](#msg5a5f869d5a9ebe4f759bc2f6)&gt; If you really think about it, variadic functions in other languages aren't really variadic, as they are wrapped in parenthese, so... `variadic: function [:p][p/1 + last p]`

You are passing the `paren!` type so red/rebol is the same as other languages.  
In the Ruby you can do:

```
def foo(*args)
   puts(args)
end
foo 2, 3, 4 
foo 2
```

So `,` is a way of saying "take this and this and this".

How could you make truly variadic function? The language has to know when to stop so they use parens (`(foo a b ...)` / `foo (a, b...)`) or some other trick like the Ruby (`foo a, b, ...`)?

[21:25](#msg5a5fbf356117191e617ad6f8)Remember that Red is Alpha. That said, a lot of the core is very solid. If you use Red/System, or short-lived, on-demand Red processes, the lack of GC (due in the next release or two) won't be an issue. e.g. micro-services on EC2. Full I/O is coming, too, which will be the bigger issue there for you. However, if you can use Red for IaaC, that would be great, as it's very expressive (being a data language first), and easy to process at a high level. If you pursue that, I'll be happy to tinker up ideas with you.

&gt; \*args in ruby collects into array, if I remember correctly. Using a block in Red for variadic seems roughly equivalent.

You don't have to use square/round brackets. Ruby has named arguments(syntactic sugar for maps - hashes in the Ruby as fair I remember) and first class functions (`function!` in the Red/Rebol I think - blocks are more powerful). With that 3 feautures you can do nice looking DSLs: https://www.leighhalliday.com/creating-ruby-dsl

@prapro `float!` uses both dot (`.`) and comma (`,`) but only comma isn't allowed as word. Why?

greggirwin

[01:25](#msg5a5ff76eba39a53f1a2b9821)@nedzadarek, lexical space is very tight in Red. Rebol allowed either dot or comma as a decimal separator in numbers, but time has told us that it didn't provide a lot of value. Red \*could* still allow it in the future, but not now. Commas aren't allowed in Rebol words either, but they come up a lot. Some people want them treated as whitespace, and they may be part of a new datatype syntax. Unless someone makes a strong argument for it, there's no good reason to allow them in words.

This would cause so many problems.  
I think I have been trying some code where every `'` is english's version of `'` (I forgot the name). It was horrible experience.

@pekr scientific notation is good too, for example: `2e2; 200.0`. I'm not sure whenever it is implemented incorrectly or it's just because the Red/Rebol is 32bit.

Red/C3 is for developing smart contracts/dApps, but Red itself can be used for everything (in the future): from OSs, to GUI applications to web development.

Not one programming language really tackles this that's why you have bloated frameworks but at least you can do it. Red doesn't have these framworks and I hope it won't but instead I hope it will have something within the language itself to create all complex design without requiring adding these bloated frameworks.

[11:19](#msg5a65c8d2ce68c3bc74eac791)@lepinekong\_twitter There are different ways to create an UI. You are completely free to come up with an architecture you prefer.

[15:20](#msg5a68a42298927d57452e4e2f)@dockimbel as you probably noticed, I pushed a \[pull request](https://github.com/red/red/pull/3209) with the `query` action, which now returns modification date of `file` value. But while working on it, I'm quite not sure, if we want to use the same functionality as Rebol did - returning an object with all possible information.

```
>> query %r3.exe
== make object! [
    name: %/C/Dev/GIT/r3/build/win-x64/r3.exe
    size: 589824
    date: 23-Jan-2018/15:40:48.084+1:00
    type: 'file
]
```

Wouldn't it be better to give the `query` a parameter, what info we are interested in? For example:

```
>> query %r3.exe 'modified
== 23-Jan-2018/15:40:48.084+1:00
>> query %r3.exe [modified size]
== [23-Jan-2018/15:40:48.084+1:00 589824]
```

[15:21](#msg5a68a489517037a212ea9f26)And extend it, so one would be able to query other possible information of the system.

[15:23](#msg5a68a4f398927d57452e5346)Because I quite don't like how it is in Rebol... where although one needs just modification date, must query everything using wrapper:

```
>> ?? modified?
modified?: make function! [[
    "Returns the last modified date of a file."
    target [file! url!]
][
    all [
        target: attempt [query target]
        target/date
    ]
]]
```

[15:28](#msg5a68a627c95f22546ddc732f)I can imagine also adding `query/into`, so one could use code like:

```
files: read %.
dates: make block! length? files
foreach file files [
	query/into file 'modified dates
]
probe dates
```

to get a specific metadata

query/with %file 'modified

Remember, with other langs, you're not changing the language itself, but if we want to allow extensions for new lexical forms, it's a whole new world, potentially leading to massive compatibility issues. DLL Hell would be nothing compared to Datatype Hell.

Have a top down view. What do they look like from the user perspective. This is most important. Then figure out how it might be implemented. Consider Dependent Types, object schemas, and how compound types might map to compound GUI elements. How are they encoded when serialized?

I'm not saying I don't want them, having used them extensively in other languages, just that we have a lot of details to think through, because Red is so different. I think there is huge potential, but we need to make it fit well with the core design principles.

greggirwin

[21:36](#msg5a68fc7298927d5745309ba7)@nedzadarek, if we could, indeed, define lexical forms for new types, you might use 2 UDTs which have different names and functionality, but use the same lexical form. The lexical form is the "system of record". If we can add new forms, Red may not be able to load data that uses them, unless those types are included, which means every agent/proxy needs to know about every UDT that may pass through it if it loads the data. Are UDTs always global in scope? What happens if, again, 2 use the same form. Load one UDT def, load some data, load another UDT def, load some data. Which UDT takes precedence? That's just off the top of my head.

To avoid that, just don't have them use lexical forms, right? But so much of Red's expressive power comes from that, what do we gain over an object/block convention for them?

I think they'll be great to have, so let's start thinking about their notation, what we want from them that we don't have now, and how it might all work.

[13:58](#msg5a69e2780ad3e04b1b68e2d7)@greggirwin  
I have been thinking about implementing UDTs in a few langauges. I think I have implemented it in some form in a few languages.  
There are 2 syntaxes: (type-a) `name#value`, (type-b) `name#{value1 value2 ... valueN}`.

Type-a cannot have spaces. Type-b can have spaces.

User shouldn't redefine types. Warn them at least. Using above syntax you can have `HSV#360,1.0,1.0` and `HSL#360,1.0,1.0` - both are using the same maximum values (360, 1.0 and 1.0), 3 values (1-360, 0.0-1.0, 0.0-1.0) and they are separated by comma (`,`).

Type provider (programmer that implements a type) will parse only his/her types. For example `HSV#360,1.0,1.0`:  
1\) the Red split it into `m: #(type-name: "HSV" value: "360,1.0,1.0")`  
2\) the Red will call `parser: parsers(m/type-name) background-color: parser/parse(m/value)`  
3\) `background-color` will be an object:

```
construct [
    type-name: "HSV"
    hue: 360
    saturation: 1.0
    value: 1.0
    method: func [a] [...]
    ; other functions (methods)
]
```

Types has functions called methods (from the OOP terminology). So you can do `background-color/darker` to make it darker, `background-color/hue 42` to change hue, `background-color + background-color` to add 2 colors (it might be just a syntactic sugar for `HSV/add background-color background-color` or `background-color/add background-color`).

As for examples of type-b (with spaces), lets take the old Ruby's hash (map in the Red):  
`#("a" 42)` in the Ruby will be `{"a" => 42}`  
1\) The red split on spaces (`result: [{"a"} "=>" "42"]`)  
2\) The type provider will parse it (s/he check if `"a"` is valid key, s/he checks if next "symbol" is `=>`, s/he check if `42` is valid as value; it will store key - value pairs)

Functions' spec should accept type provided by programmer.  
For example `f: function [color1 [HSV]] [print color/hue]` so when `f` is called `color1: HSV#222,0.5,0.5 f f color1`it will check if types in spec and type of an argument match (`HSV/type-name == color1/type-name`).

I need to think how to extend above syntax to dependent types.

What you think about it?  
ps. If I made mistake I'll clarify it later.

So I try to compile a \_\_debug mode\__ console in order to output more infos when I compile Red or R/S, like `dump` the stack that Nenad showed in that issue, it's quite helpful fot trainee like me.

But the console I compiled can't compile any thing, because it enter CLI directly. Maybe I use the wrong option when I compile a console?

[07:51](#msg5a6ed295494bd0f5303a436f)Thanks @PeterWAWood . Yes, debug a executable with tools like `gdb` and `lldb`.

But in that issue, Nenad showed how to add some useful functions like `stack/dump` and `dump4 name` to debug R/S.

And I found `0.6.3/runtime/stack.reds` also has a `dump` function if it is in `debug mode`, so i think maybe i can see how the Red runtime stack is by this.

```
#if debug? = yes [

[13:15](#msg5a6f1e794a6b0dd32b5ffa69)@rebolek Yeah, that's why I don't know where the `red-0.6.3.exe` comes from.  
At this issue https://github.com/red/red/issues/1983, Nenad said we can `re-compile a GUI console version in debug mode`.

And the \[README](https://github.com/red/red) also told how to compile a console.

rebolek

[13:21](#msg5a6f1fe4494bd0f5303c1c83)@haolloyin I see. That's expected, because you need Rebol to compile Red. `red-0.6.3.exe` contains Rebol interpreter. The line

```

What's the difference between something like this (with array: `arr: [1 2 3]`):`ind: (print 'hacked! 1 + 1) arr/:ind` and path style: `arr/(print 'hacked! 1 + 1)`? Both styles can be abused.

[16:48](#msg5a79dc687dcd63481f262aec)@nedzadarek, we can abuse Red in all kinds of ways, so I don't think that's a strong argument for removing the feature. Paths are a type of block. We could say that any value should be allowed as a path segment, but that would dramatically complicate the lexer I imagine, so we accept that they are somewhat limited in their lexical form. I admit that embedded parens in paths don't scan as well visually, at least to me, but they can be oh so useful.

[16:50](#msg5a79dcdce217167e2c4d8be5)@Ivo-Balbaert, As others said, the REPL is strictly interpreted at this time, but that doesn't rule out future possibilities. e.g., in the future, you might be able to define routines in the REPL, where you can't today.

```
>> r: routine [][]
*** Internal Error: routines require compilation, from OS shell: `red -r <script.red>`
*** Where: do
*** Stack: routine cause-error
```

yes, that's my point too

What is not allowed?

&gt; I admit that embedded parens in paths don't scan as well visually, at least to me, but they can be oh so useful

Lot's of things can be overdone. In my opinion doing something simple can look nice, e.g. `arr/(index) + arr/(index + 1)`

PeterWAWood

[22:49](#msg5a7a30eee217167e2c4fa9a6)@9214 You are correct that the compiler is two-stage, first the Red is compiled to Red/System code and then the Red/System code and the Red RunTime are compiled to executable machine code.

To add a little more detail, currently the more dynamic Red constructs are compiled to a series of calls to the Red runtime rather than to specific machine instructions.

The most obvious example is the `do` function. `do [i: 0 i: i + 1]` would be compiled to a runtime call. The addition would not be compiled to machine code but effectively interpreted. It would run at very much the same speed as if it were entered in the console.

There are two expected improvements in this area. The first is the introduction of a JIT compiler. The second is improvements in the compiler so that it can generate machine code directly from more of the dynamic constructs (e.g. the dynamic-stack branch). I'm sure we will see many more improvements once the compiler is self-hosted.

[07:04](#msg5a7bf6904a6b0dd32ba3d4cb)Is there a way to dump the current state of a running Red process? It would be nice to be able to work on something, stash it and then come back to it later. Sort of like Smalltalk, I guess, but not quite. What would it take to be able to dump the current state in an image file which you can just reload and resume at a later point?

greggirwin

[07:15](#msg5a7bf8f8e217167e2c594a12)There isn't currently. `Mold/all` is needed for serializing all values correctly, so they could be reloaded. Generally storing an image that way should be easy (it's come up in the past, for R2, but nobody ever pushed it all the way AFAIK). If you want currently executing state, like a complete continuation you could pass, that's a slightly different story, but Red is a data format, so it's a matter of also serializing things like call stacks and making those loadable.

[12:22](#msg5a7c41066117191e610e38a4)Has anyone here worked with Q from Kx Systems? It is purportedly a derivative of APL. Its built-in database (KDB+) is used to build high-volume apps for trading systems etc. http://code.kx.com/q/  
It has this nifty feature where you can launch a Q console or process with a parameter from the command line to listen on a TCP port, or alternatively, you can start a server from within a console. Then, in a second process, you can send expressions from the console (or an application) to have it executed in the first process.  
I remember someone pointing to an example in Rebol (maybe it was here) not long ago that showed how trivial it is to set up a server for evaluating expressions sent to it. A built-in feature like that could be a pretty handy standard/mezzanine addition, and once there is networking Red, I guess that should be possible?

&gt; @mydoghasworms this https://github.com/red/red/wiki/Using-Red-as-CGI ?

What I have in mind is something like the following simplistic Rebol script.

```
REBOL []

server-port: open/lines tcp://:5000
forever [
    connection-port: first server-port
    until [
        wait connection-port
        error? try [
          insert connection-port mold do first connection-port
        ]

    close connection-port

So you can just telnet to the port and evaluate expressions, for example.

For tokenomics, one of the first things we need to do is figure out:

\- How to make it easy for people to get tokens they are awarded  
\- The formulae for retroactive token distribution, for past contributions

[16:13](#msg5a806bb893be87284da329f1)@gour, nobody can say exactly why. It seems like it should have. Not being open source limited it, certainly, but they had some very useful products. If you look at AltMe and IOS, then look at things today, you'll see that Carl was (once again) ahead of his time.

Perl predated Rebol by a long way, and Ruby by just a bit. But Ruby went 10 years or so without becoming popular. It was Ruby on Rails that triggered the change. That's the kind of thing you can't predict or \*make* happen. You can try to make success happen by spending a lot of money on advertising, but there's no silver bullet.

gour

[16:15](#msg5a806c3ece68c3bc74720fc5)in any case, Red does bring much more to the table. :moneybag:

We now have native mobile apps on the rise because of performance using a browser on those devices, but we may yet see a stripped down browser to try and compete there using JS+. Blockchains may rise and fall dramatically, but Red is ahead of other langs in this area.

[16:21](#msg5a806d887084124a3463855e)Not a sure thing, but if we can find a way to survive, and grow the community to reach critical mass, Red has the ability to morph more than any other language with a more human friendly syntax, IMO. Lisps and FP are great, but not for the average programmer doing line of business work.

[16:26](#msg5a806eb918f388e6268d238f)Something else we have is Red/System. C is popular for a reason. But we're not going to replace C anytime soon. It's not just the language, but the tooling, and the vast number of users that make C dominate. But Rust, Go, and others are gaining ground; D and others showed new features could ease development while not losing the flavor and power. I'm anxious to see some system level thinkers push the design and implementation of R/S going forward.

gour

I have looked at Racket. It has a long history and lots of features, but it's also pretty big. And it's still just Scheme.

[16:41](#msg5a80723193be87284da344d3)The hard part, with something like Hugo (and we've had those in the past), is that people want their "stuff" added. You need to support X, oh, and Y, and it should all be extensible, or maybe opinionated, and make it easy to use HTML and CSS and my flavor of templates, etc. For better or worse, the Redbol developer mindset is often "Here's a simple thing that works, and that's enough. Hack it if you want to because I have other things to do and I don't care about being popular." That is, we want to build things \*we* want and like, and if others do as well, that's great, but we tend not to add things that might attract others just because; especially if they seem like bad ideas.

greggirwin

[06:32](#msg5a8134e3b3c4a0d3760f948a)`Copy` doesn't treat a single matched value as a special case. That is, `copy` will give you everything that matches the rule, and the only way it can do that is to put them in a block.

```
>> parse ["foo" "bar"][copy a 1 string! (probe to-block a)]
["foo"]

["foo" "bar"]

```

[06:33](#msg5a813542d74ee9f50db23046)It's not the same, but a parallel is using `copy/part`, which will always return a block, even if only 1 value is returned.

== ["foo"]
>> copy/part ["foo" "bar"] 2
== ["foo" "bar"]

[06:42](#msg5a8137618c71e5e01d835f50)This is a better example (can't edit the first anymore), because you don't need `to-block` in there.

@BuilderGuy1  
Ruby, Ruby on rails and Rake

RoR - you can use it for rapid prototyping or small to mid-size sites. I read that if someone needs a "bigger site" s/he use different programming language. As fair I can remember the Github was written in Ruby (on rails). They changed (some?) things to other languages, Erlang as I can read in the wiki.

Ruby was slow (as is not as fast as other trending languages) till version &lt;2.0. Around ~2.0 they added tail call optimization - so you can write in the functional style without loosing the speed. I don't know how good is nowadays but I guess it's not "bad".  
This language is easy to write. Sure... you can write a lot of things without writing pages of useless code. Someone asked about "Rubyist going to Rebol/Red" - well... both languages are "easy" to write/read.

Rake - you can automate things using this.

@greggirwin  
About PHP: I think I read somewhere (no source, sorry) that PHP was the answer for not simple HTML pages. At that time there were only C (or other "similar" languages) or HTML. HTML was easy but you cannot write too much in it; C was powerfull... but harder.

@lepinekong\_twitter, use `source`. @rebolek has also bulit a function to take you to native source definitions, but we need to figure out how to extend it to actions and such, which is tricky because actions are implemented in each type, so there is no single source location to take you to.

Red Code:

```

print "From Red"

#system [
	#include %../Red-System/test.reds
	f
]

print "From Red"

r: routine [][f]
r

print "From Red"
```

Red/System code:

```
Red/System []

f: func [] [
	print ["From Red System" lf]

```

When compiled and run, it gave this output:

```
From Red
From Red System

[12:14](#msg5a8579bbce68c3bc748d0f4b)I can't think of any language in wide use today that this doesn't apply to. Java was given away for free, C, C++, go and Javascript all fall into this category. It is interesting that Open languages tend to be adopted faster, if you skip the Java outlier. (C# and VB.net were not originally free, and didn't see much adoption till they were. Once they were, they were still seen as lesser languages until they were no longer tied only to Windows. And now that they are Open Source and Open Governance, they have seen a huge pickup in popularity.) Java became popular mostly by accident, because it felt familiar and had some promise of cross platform portability that no other language that was familiar was promising.

JacobGood1

[14:41](#msg5a859c1fb3c4a0d37628fec9)@BeardPower It is true in general but not entirely. A small amount of languages developed make their creators money, but if you compare the monetary compensation for language creators to app creators, it is a large delta.

greggirwin

[17:35](#msg5a85c4f7b3c4a0d3762a3592)&gt; It is interesting that Open languages tend to be adopted faster

Any hard stats on this? Anecdotal evidence is fine, and we all have it, but there are many factors involved, and some important exceptions. I can't find an historical timeline of language popularity, but that would be a great thing to put together, even with some soft numbers the farther back we go, before all the old programmers are dead.

&gt; Java became popular mostly by accident

The marketing team at Sun might object to that statement. :^)

Most of us know that early software was given away with the hardware. You sold hardware. Then many languages came out of academia and research labs (e.g. Bell and Xerox Parc). Still relatively specialized work, yes? Then PCs and BASIC (also systems like Pick and Theos of course), and we got more programmers. Step forward just a bit to the mid-to-late 80s, and we have a lot of of very popular commercial \*tools\*. It's true that Kemeny and Kurtz, Stroustrup, and Wirth didn't benefit, but a lot of BASIC, C/C++, and Pascal compilers were sold. Was VB still BASIC? What about Flash and its tooling?

I agree with @JacobGood1 about how to follow the money here, and that's an important lesson for us. It's also true that times have changed, and will continue to do so. In the early days, you had just a few languages, and each really had a purpose (simulation, business, scientific computing, etc.), now we have a few new languages every month it seems, many resembling some of the earliest.

Do I think we can sell Red (the language)? Not so much. Do I think we can make a living \*using* it? You bet. Do I think Fullstack and other companies can build successful businesses around Red, whether it be tooling, app dev kits, blockchain tech, consulting, and more? Absolutely.

[20:34](#msg5a85eecc5cc187264544a521)Yes. Only top languages are charted in Tiobe but the long term history tells us something, and even other lang placement. For example, SAS, LabView, and Apex are tied to commercial ventures, yes? Other questions we can ask, like how many JVM langs are executed on the official JVM (commercially supported) or SQL on a paid DB product, or would JS on the server exist without Joyent's commitment? Are Objective-C and Swift "free"? We can argue semantics about a lot of things, but the question is what we can learn from history to help increase Red's chances of success, because we know the world will be a better place if we succeed. :^)

[00:16](#msg5a8622ef3fca9ee30b9c8085)Personally, I identify more with needs than features. That is, let's look at things we want to build and find out where the holes are that need to be filled. Some of these we know. Want long-running processes? GC makes your life a lot easier. That's a very broad need, as is full I/O. Beyond things like that, what do \*we* want to build with Red? I know what I've built in the past, and the many projects I still want to build, including a lot of Red-focused tools.

My thoughts on COBOL were in the sense of its long life of use, IMO due to its robustness, ease of understanding due to its expressiveness, anyone who knows the English language can understand a source file, and finally and above all, the implication from the manufacturers of HW.

It is clear that Red can have those characteristics, and I hope that the ICO will help to give the support that the manufacturers of HW gave at the time to COBOL, but we may have to make some noise to increase audience when 1.0 would be reached IMO.

-c is your daily driver, if you're writing Red and don't need to build a custom runtime. That is the runtime (libRedRT) will not be rebuilt (unless it doesn't exist), so compiles are fast.

-r will rebuild the runtime and make you a single EXE. Slower to compile.

-t cross-compile for another platform.

-u between -c and -r. External libRedRT runtime, but it is rebuilt. Slower compile, not a standalone EXE.

-e encap mode. Compile the runtime and include your script, uncompiled, into a single EXE. Your script will then run interpreted, which is helpful if you run up against a compiler limitation.

Let's maybe set up a temporary room, to avoid flooding chat here, make a wiki page to doc environments, and see if we can narrow this down.

[01:31](#msg5a88d77fc3c5f8b90dcd45ac)&gt; Is there some advantage when a file! is any-string?

@nedzadarek words are symbols, which will live in a symbol table. Those are necessarily limited in size. If files were words, and you loaded, say, the entire file tree for a large hard drive, that would be hard for symbol management. Words/symbols are also generally limited in size, where strings aren't. File systems tend to limit things more than we would have to, and Red doesn't limit word sizes today, but large symbols could also be harder for a system to manage efficiently.

We can think of word types as things that are at least somewhat limited in the number of variations we expect to use, even if that number is in the millions. String types are effectively unlimited.

Finally, word types are more limited in their lexicon than strings. In this case, that matters a lot because words can't contain `/`, but that is part of `file!` syntax.

[14:38](#msg5a898fd3e4ff28713a92fddd)&gt; @virtualAlan, https://github.com/red/red readme shows all the command line options, except -e (encap mode), which needs to be added.

-c is your daily driver, if you're writing Red and don't need to build a custom runtime. That is the runtime (libRedRT) will not be rebuilt (unless it doesn't exist), so compiles are fast.

-r will rebuild the runtime and make you a single EXE. Slower to compile.

-t cross-compile for another platform.

-u between -c and -r. External libRedRT runtime, but it is rebuilt. Slower compile, not a standalone EXE.

-e encap mode. Compile the runtime and include your script, uncompiled, into a single EXE. Your script will then run interpreted, which is helpful if you run up against a compiler limitation.

is Red compiled or interpreted? I always thought it is compiled. if we have to include our script, then it is interpreted in my opinion. compiling will generate machine code. is the .exe code that we generate from compiling a Red program, the same as a self executable that I can create for example with winzip or winrar ?

&gt; is the .exe code that we generate from compiling a Red program, the same as a self executable that I can create for example with winzip or winrar ?

No, though I believe this is what @virtualAlan does with his EXEs, as he includes extra resources with them. With a Red exe, it is and remains entirely self contained. It is a native executable for the target platform. You can compile it all to native code (which is required for Red/System code), or you can include code which is interpreted at runtime. You can also mix and match however you want. For example, if you want to compile for performance, but there are some extremely dynamic parts of your code, or things the compiler doesn't handle yet, you can wrap the dynamic parts in `do [...]`, which will cause them to be interpreted, even though you used a CLI switch that compiles everything else (that is, not `-e`).

@lepinekong\_twitter, if the above `default` approach is too complicated, I don't know how mcu simpler it can be. I do have a more advanced version that can operate on multiple values, but I don't think that will help in this case, because we don't seem to understand the goal, or why it's hard for you to do in Red.

Can you tell us, in plain words, not code, what you want to do? Pseudo code is fine. e.g. "I want to type a CLI command like &lt;example&gt; and be able to omit &lt;x y z&gt;." or "I want to define and call functions with a spec like `fn: func [opt a opt b opc c][...]` and be able to omit any or all args." That kind of description. Then maybe we can narrow down a way to do it.

Examples from how other langs do it are fine too, with links to specifics.

[12:04](#msg5a8d604ce4ff28713aa8a70d)@nedzadarek of course it is easier if you also need the full power of console. If you use a DSL you have to reimplement every features the console has.

lepinekong\_twitter

[12:13](#msg5a8d625ca2194eb80d9310d9)evaluate arbitrary code is dangerous you have to put a lot of checking which may be not enough. Being able to create a simple hook is natural, short and perfectly fit the need. Why use convoluated solutions. I love DSL but it should be more integrable into the whole.

[12:17](#msg5a8d634b35dd17022ed44ad3)One of the huge advantage of rebol / red is being able of using word as symbol. so you don't need to use those pesky " everywhere. You can even use . as variable name. The console is really a good REPL. The only thing missing is easy extensability in rebol / red herself without being a compiler guru.

So they are embedding extra stuff into the file, invisible in their normal Atom-based editor. they basically wrote their compiler as a plug-in for Atom, which at present is their chassis. Atom is a very elaborate editor so it sure gives you a big jump.

I see. Interesting.

&gt; @nedzadarek, https://doc.red-lang.org/en/reactivity.html#\_is doesn't show `map!` support for `is`, so I'm not sure what you're trying to do. The reactive system is tied to objects, which have a `context` words can bind to, unlike maps.

But then your `is` body is defined \*outside* that, yes? A `with` approach, as some of us have built, should work with `is`, until we can think more about this.

I was doing it in the function, something like this:

```
foo: function [<args>] [
   m: #()
   m/rea: make reactor! [...]
   m/arr: is [...]
  return m
]
```

The `map!` was simpler to use than the `object!`. I'll try to use the `object!`.  
btw. you made me realize that I have a bug. I tried to store `is` into `word!` which were global, when I set it into local, there were errors. I guess after a function return some stuffs are deleted or we cannot access it. Here is a pseudo code:

```
foo: function [<args>] [
   m: #()
   m/rea: make reactor! [...]
   _arr: is [...]
  m/arr: _arr
  return m
]
```

This works because \_arr is global variable. With `/local _arr` it doesn't work.

Well, thank you for clarifications.

@viayuve, as was said, this depends on the implementation model. Map-Reduce is one of the more popular, since Google started using it, but the Tuplespace model calls it a "school of pirhanas". All variations on the theme of parallel computing.

[18:17](#msg5a91ac1f888332ee3ac86d6e)Hi y'all! I just learned about red/rebol and am very excited. I have some rudimentary programming knowledge but never had the time to become truly productive. I'm thinking that with this option I might actually get some projects done, but I've got a few questions: 1. I run 64bit arch linux. I've run into problems running rebol because of that. Is there an easy solution? 2. I can run red, but the GUI functions don't seem to be working. Is that something that's just not developed yet or a problem on my side?

[18:21](#msg5a91ad1a35dd17022eeb9241)@bandobras hey there, welcome!  
\* What are the problems with Rebol, specifically? \[This post](https://killring.org/2012/12/16/developer-notebook-installing-rebol/) might help.  
\* Yes, Linux backend is a work in progress. There was \[community effort](https://toltex.u-ga.fr/RedGtk) a while ago to bring it up to speed in development, but currently it's stalled. Wine works just fine for simple cases, although doesn't look much pretty.

BeardPower

[22:52](#msg5a91ecb653c1dbb7437186a8)Tweens are just calculated values based on a formula over time. Porter&amp;Duff operators should be straightforward.

greggirwin

[22:54](#msg5a91ed1fc3c5f8b90dff2b1e)&gt; Is there a reason, why R3 and Red are not joining forces?

As with most things, there's not just one, simple reason.

BeardPower

[22:55](#msg5a91ed526fba1a703a980153)Tweens are very useful for other stuff besides facets. as well as effects, so I think it would be a good design if they act as an external feature instead of tightly integrated into a facet.

greggirwin

[22:55](#msg5a91ed6c6f8b4b9946b9ce98)@BeardPower, great technical answer, but doesn't tell me how you see them working in Red. ;^)

[22:56](#msg5a91ed9e8f1c77ef3a4f00de)I do think having a model that works for simple animation and transitions would be great though. That's an important use case in today's world.

True.

[23:01](#msg5a91eebde4ff28713ac12b18)I though of an animation/tween DSL: tween \[ &lt;mode&gt; &lt;from&gt; &lt;to&gt; &lt;time&gt;]

[23:02](#msg5a91eeff888332ee3ac9ab45)As there is rate already, it can be feed into the tween as a timer for updating the linear interpolation (lerp).

greggirwin

[23:04](#msg5a91ef6c6fba1a703a9809d4)I agree that external, rather than a facet, is the way to go. Would be cool if it could also work on draw blocks.

BeardPower

[23:05](#msg5a91efcf35dd17022eecc1fa)That's the idea. As it's just doing a lerp , t's totally independent on a target. The outcome of the tween is used in any way the user think s of.

[14:16](#msg5a9416cc8f1c77ef3a58beab)I've been looking at the LSP specs some time ago and it was very loooong list.

StephenStrickland

[14:29](#msg5a9419bb458cbde557cce2f7)It is a fairly long list, luckily we don't have to implement everything at first. We could match the functionality of the current VS Code extension and build from there.

In regard to Red tooling, I see a few options:  
1\. Create a custom Red IDE (costly, but would allow us to create an idiomatic IDE for Red)  
2\. Maintain the current VS Code extension (the current code base is still using an old version of the extension API and completions/hover currently aren't working on Mac)  
3\. Start fresh and implement an LSP server (would allow for IDE like tooling for any editor that has a Red LSP client extension)

[15:40](#msg5a942a8153c1dbb7437bc967)VSCode is nice, but using it for a Red IDE does not follow the "KISS" and "Drink your own wine" way that redbol embrace.

Running some kind of server from Microsoft for writing scripts, which is what I usually do, sounds like an overkill.

StephenStrickland

[17:34](#msg5a944517458cbde557ce3aed)@Oldes thanks for the link, but with all due respect I'm not just wanting syntax highlighting for my code, I'm hoping to get code completions, hover for definition, jump to definition,... LSP is simply a protocol that Microsoft that created while developing VS Code that provides standardized way to provide all those things. Implementing LSP would allow us to write a single "server" (it can be a console app that reads/writes to stdin/out) in Red, then we can implement various clients (extensions/plugins for editors) that leverage this server.

greggirwin

[18:04](#msg5a944c14888332ee3ad4f22d)@StephenStrickland, please add LSP and relevant links to https://github.com/red/red/wiki/Editor-Integrations. From there, we can create an LSP working page for those who want to contribute and see what happens. It could also be a source of inspiration and ideas. I don't know as I only glanced at it briefly some time back.

WRT external tools, we don't want to exclude them or discourage those who want to use them. On the contrary, people should be able to use Red however they want. But we also want there to be Red alternatives that \*allow* people to be a purer shade of Red if they so desire. That is, the less required externalities we impose on the user the better; it should be their choice.

[21:28](#msg5a947bf40202dc012e8accdb)It's a good question that applies in other areas though. There are times when a special case seems like it would make some things easier, but having Red do the general thing helps simplify the overall implementation. Other times we can be very elaborate in our handling of things. The joy of design.

BeardPower

[21:34](#msg5a947d538f1c77ef3a5bb80b)Yes, I was thinking about, if the handling the special would make sense. It would just be consequent to handle a char as a char. If this is beneficial is another story :)

[11:21](#msg5a953f318f1c77ef3a5fdb2e)@JacobGood1 I lack the experience so take my word with a grain of salt.  
I think LOP is too big or is too cumbersome for smaller DSLs.  
Bigger DSLs have already language they use, like Java or Erlang. I don't know how they can connect language like Erlang and Racket. It's possible but do the every language designers want to do this? I don't think so.

I think many features of the Racket's LOP will be used by other programming languages.  
Contracts are nice. I think they were implemented in some "small" form by @rebolek when he tried to implement the dependent types (`dispatch` and `dispatcher` functions...).

ps. I haven't been trying the Racket for months/years... so something might changed.  
ps2. Knowlege programming languages might be a big thing. We, as programmers, tends to do less and less basic stuffs. "The knowledge" helps doing less things so I think some part of programmers would "program" (I don't think it would be programming like we know today) in such languages. The Wolfram tries to do this.

nedzadarek

[14:54](#msg5a957123e4d1c636049f693d)@JacobGood1 You can write simple (yet good looking) DSLs using functions (methods), `do...end`/`{}` syntax and variables. Here is an example of the Rake:

```
task default: %w[test]

task :test do
  ruby "test/unittest.rb"
end
```

`task` is just a function that takes `:test` (the Symbol type, something like `string!` but more efficient) and `do...end` block.  
The `task`doesn't know what is in the `do...end` block.

@9214  
No. In the LOP and Metaprogramming reflection ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection\_(computer\_science) ) is useful. `?` does it in the Red/Rebol (not in 100% of course). I can do `f: does [] ? f` but I cannot do the same with `slider`.  
Racket has nice features and tools. I remember it has tools that shows graph of functions.  
The elm has nice features too: http://debug.elm-lang.org/

9214

[14:58](#msg5a95720b458cbde557d51f4e)@nedzadarek again, reflection has nothing to do with documentation. What you're talking about is what @pekr said recently - extending `help` to support hooks from dialects and modules.

You can write OO in Haskel or FP in Java but some styles are more natural to some types of languages. Ruby is one of the "mixed type".  
Red/Rebol has nice parser (`parse`) and "code as data" but Racket offers muuuch more to offer. Racket doesn't encourage you to write DSLs but the whole new language with a new syntax. That's the difference between Red and Racket.

```
face/extra/highlighted: face/extra/get-pie face face/extra/get-angle event/offset - face/extra/center

This will convert face to a float, as the following actual parameters would be treated as `face float float` instead of `face float`, `face` being knocked off.

You need to put the calculation in parentheses:

nedzadarek

[16:22](#msg5a9828e30202dc012e9d8442)@lepinekong\_twitter IDE would be great but you can make nice console like the Ruby's Pry.  
@gltewalt You are right, "Access violation".

1\) Can you set what console prints when entering series. With "long strings" `{}` the console prints `{` before every line:

```
>> {
{    fsdf
{    fds
{    }
```

2\) I am wondering if it's possible to do in Red. Or you need Red's macros?  
Can you make a function that takes a `word!`. A newly created function will be run with a next `word!`. For example:  
`start foo baz` will create a new function `foo` and it will run like `foo baz`.  
You can make a function that takes a `word!` and it can define some function:

```
func ['a][set a does [print 42]]
foo ert
;== func [][print 42]
ert
42
```

but you have to call it manually.

&gt; Is there a different strategy for interactive documentation in Red planned already?

@BeardPower, no single strategy planned yet, but we have some history there, with old R2 tools like EasyVID, EasyDraw, etc., and Docs LiveCoding example. Adapting things as experiments always teaches us something, but doesn't always produce the best end-result. I think the notebook model is a good one for many things, and didn't start with Jupyter. Ultimately, we can't just transplant ideas into Red directly. We have to think about how it all hangs together. But experiments are often fun and easy.

[13:44](#msg5a9bf826e4d1c63604be0fe5)@viayuve You can do kernel programming like device drivers or kernel modules using Red/System. We have a compilation \[mode](https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/system/config.r#L84) for Win32 drivers that was used to write a virtual filesystem a few years ago by a U.S. company (Bo's company). Compiling Linux kernel modules would require some additional changes in the ELF emitter, though it could be contributed easily by any Linux expert here.

[13:48](#msg5a9bf942e4d1c63604be1433)@viayuve For Arduino, I made an experimental AVR8 backend for Red/System in 2012, though it was just a proof of concept (PoC) capable of implementing the canonical blinking LED on port 13 (IIRC). The 8-bit boards are a bit too tight for Red/System, but the PoC showed that it is doable. I didn't continue that experiment, as the 32-bit boards started rising already. Having a 32-bit board backend for Red/System is definitely doable, and if the board has enough RAM (2MB at least), running Red scripts is possible.

Those are specific features of the area face in Rebol/View, you don't need them in Red/View if you just want to wrap a very long line in an area by inserting newlines at adequate places. `size-text` can measure the text chunks size for you, so you can calculate where to break the line.

[15:45](#msg5a9d66372dfcfffd2b2b1522)the interface is a little "too much" but can be very well configured. downside is lack of github integration. Plus is it has very working search feature.

[01:14](#msg5a9deb62c3c5f8b90d398f47) `and` and `or` are bitwise operators in Red. This is the expected behaviour.

A new development branch and roadmap is set for the Red/C3 toolchain (you can read it at the end of the \[whitepaper](https://ico.red-lang.org/RED-whitepaper.pdf)).

\*\*Announcement\** For those who wish to involve themselves in programming the toolchain, I have made a utility that lists (almost) all identifiers, except local variables, that are defined in the Rebol, Red and Red/System sources. The output is a `.csv` file, exploitable by Excel, with columns `lemma,category,language,source file,context/target,value/docstring`. The program source (in Rebol) is \[here](https://gist.github.com/meijeru/ce66cfaf6c4ef8add2ab2065541449a1). The program header should contain sufficient information for anyone to operate it. Comments and questions are of course welcome.

\*\*Announcement nr. 2\** For those who need to work with the actual implementation of Red values as the occur in the computer memory, I have made a utility that will show the addresses and numbers for the "value slots" with most of the linked information. The program is \[here](https://gist.github.com/meijeru/69bb9cb4244746c3ca1a1c7bb902b06c). This is a Red program, that needs to be compiled since it uses routines to get at the actual addresses.

```
Comment:	{This version has to cope with sources in Rebol and Red(/System).
				 That is why minor changes are needed to %lexer.r and some sources.
				 These are:
				In %lexer.r, adapt the header-rule to accept any valid REBOL,
				Red or Red/System header, and adapt the escape-rule to accept
				any #[...] construct. Also suppress the quit/halt in throw-error
				in order to have more information about further adaptations that
				may be necessary. Store the adapted lexer as %red-lexer-adapted.r.
				List any file that would still give a lexical error in the block avoid,
				together with the offending element. Furthermore, list the files
				that cannot or need not be analyzed, in the block ignore-sources}

[00:16](#msg5aa080d8e4d1c63604d4d275)@hiiamboris Because you create a `text face` with the `font spec` in `prot`. This will set the parent in `prot` accordingly to the `text face`.  
It's a binding, so it is altered. If you don't want to alter the original `proc` you need to pass a copy of it to the `face`:

```
m: size-text/with (make face! [type: 'text font: copy proto]) "x"

[06:01](#msg5aa0d1d0c3c5f8b90d485365)@githubnyn You already have a lib for that \[there](https://github.com/red/code/tree/master/Library/SQLite).

[06:05](#msg5aa0d2a56fba1a703ae0073c)@bratish First you need to learn \[Red/System](http://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs-light.html) and see how to create bindings to the macOS API, like we did for instance for the macOS View \[backend](https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/modules/view/backends/macOS/cocoa.reds). Of course, you also need to learn the macOS API from Apple documentation.

[15:49](#msg5aa15b78458cbde5570ee73e)Yes, it can be done with a shader, but Red does not support shaders yet, so you have to do software rendering.  
You could rasterizing the image with some squares and the size of your choice. For every square you will draw a circle with some glow around it. The glow is just some circle with transparency, as there is no Gaussian blur yet in Red (you could use a lib/DSL, which supports that). The particles will be spawned randomly with an attached tweening of size and the alpha component of it's color.

[10:40](#msg5aa2648ce4d1c63604dd7bf8)Hi everyone! When I enter fun: "inc: func \[n]\[n + 1]" in the REPL I get == {inc: func \[n]\[n + 1]"^/}

If you are unsure of the grammaticality of the argument of `load` you could do `try [load "..."]` this will give an error if the stuff between quotes is not valid Red.

[20:11](#msg5aa2ea696f8b4b99460b5982)@lepinekong\_twitter, first, please move to red/help for ongoing help questions on specific things you're struggling with. Second, I'm going to give you some "tough love", in the spirit of encouragement. It's great to ask questions here, and we are happy to help, but sometimes it feels like you're not putting in much effort before asking for help here, which may just be the way it looks to me. You also want to do things your own way, which is also fine, but if someone suggests an idea or approach, please do them the courtesy of following up on it. We're all really trying to help.

For VID and View, there are some pretty good docs at https://doc.red-lang.org/en/view.html and https://doc.red-lang.org/en/vid.html. You can also look at https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/tests/view-test.red to see a lot of lower level view examples at work.

On your simulation dialect, it is a \*huge* and vague question. We can help with small pieces, but from your example (which looks really cool), it's impossible to know how exactly you want it to work. That makes it hard to offer suggestions.

You're tackling a lot of ambitious projects, all at once it seems. :^) My advice is to take some time to get really comfortable with Red at a fundamental level. If you want to build dialects, you're going to want to learn `parse`. You can do it other ways, of course, but `parse` is almost always the best way. Learning `view` at a lower level is great, but it's a \*lot* more work than VID. In all my years of Reboling, there are very few cases where VID couldn't do what I needed. True, Red is in its early days there, but still very powerful and capable. Try `VID` first. When you hit a limitation, learn what you need to learn in `view` \*then* to solve that problem.

nedzadarek

[21:04](#msg5aa2f6fa35dd17022e3f8dfc)@9214 It seems when `error!` is set to the variable, and it's the last expression it will "raise an error":

```
e: try [1 / 0] probe e print 'hello true e
make error! [
   (...)
]
hello ; printed message 
; *** Math Error: attempt to divide by zero
; *** Where: /
; *** Stack:
```

However some function raise it as well. `probe` won't trigger it, but `print` does trigger it.

[22:49](#msg5aa30f5c6fba1a703aeb6c22)`if all [word = 'list find [poke insert] action][` As @ZenoArrow says, break it down and use `help`. Start with `if`. From there you should see how `all` works. Play with each of them in the REPL a bit, to get comfortable with them. Inside the `all` block, you do have to think a bit like an interpreter, finding where "phrases" end. In this case, there's an equality check, then a `find` call. So look at `find` and \*really* get comfortable with it, because you'll use it a lot and it's important and powerful.

[22:51](#msg5aa30fe80a1614b712010d56)Now you can look back up and see that `word` and `action` are args to the func. Next, search for that func. Hint, it has to do with object ownership. A google search on the function name should lead you to some notes on it.

It seems you know a lot more about Red's future than we do. :-) I wonder where do you get your information from?  
One thing that does not seem clear for people not used to open source world: the Red core team does not have to provide every possible feature, the community is providing and will provide libraries, like in any other programming language communities.

lepinekong\_twitter

[07:55](#msg5aa38f5a458cbde5571947ea)@dockimbel I said only "probably" so it's a guess based on the fact that you already have a lot of things to do and that if people really want it they can use Red/System to bind with libraries ;)

[08:06](#msg5aa391f40a1614b71202c4c9)There is no strong case to be made for supporting FTP into Red's core, that protocol is just too unsecure to be used anywhere else than on a LAN, and in such case, they are other better alternatives. For SSH/SCP/SFTP, that's a different story, it may or may not be implemented by the core team, it may or may not be sponsored by the Foundation, it may or may not be part of the core library. Those options are not decided yet.

lepinekong\_twitter

[08:08](#msg5aa392646f8b4b99460dd799)Sure I won't use FTP for secure enterprise. I'm talking about a mere personal site which is on shared hosting that only offers you ftp. That's why it's not strategic.

[08:09](#msg5aa392bae4ff28713a15f7e5)@lepinekong\_twitter If you have a server online with a FTP server running on them, I strongly advise you to shut it down immediatly and set up a SFTP server instead, otherwise your server is at high risk of intrusion.

[09:03](#msg5aa4f0d2e4ff28713a1b2648) Will there be a debugger for Red one day (at least just in VSCode ?): REPL is good when you create a new function from scratch but when you need to debug a regression of a long or recursive function, it becomes a headache.  
For example in https://gist.github.com/lepinekong/15d78322ecce84cfbcf892ce1cdbda88  
I have 2 bugs in this function:

```
searh ".^/"
```

sometimes works sometime not and

```
search/in "something" %.red
```

(searching something in all .red files)

Another example is a base58 encoding due to lack of big integer I made a recursive division function, It works for small string not for longer one, I just gave up debugging it with probe and ?? it was too tiresome :smile:

[09:18](#msg5aa4f465a60157d62fd34321)@lepinekong I would much prefer for you to post this kind of question in `red/help`. There you may get more attention. But for now I note that `search/in` is not a valid call, since the `/in` refinement is not defined. Also your search does not look in files but in blocks of lines, therefore you should FIRST create a block of lines from a single file with `read/lines`. Searching in ALL files would need even more explicit handling. The compiler/interpreter cannot just guess what you want to do...

lepinekong\_twitter

[09:23](#msg5aa4f5968f1c77ef3aa92d07)@lepinekong\_twitter It may help the readers, the compiler/interpreter AND yourself if you supply types for your function arguments, like `function[searchString [string!] lines [block!] /whole-line ...]`, or even `function[searchString [string!] lines [block!] "of strings" /whole-line ...]` using the possibility of comments after each argument.

```
the model we aim at is the Actor model. It is a good fit for Red and would provide a clean way to
handle concurrent and parallel tasks across multiple cores and processors. Though, a few years has
passed since that plan was made, so we will need to revisit it when the work on 0.9.0 will start

[11:40](#msg5aa515b70a1614b712087194)per \[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure\_Data) page:  
&gt; Like Max, Pd has a modular code base of externals or objects which are used as building blocks for programs written in the software. This makes the program arbitrarily extensible through a public API, and encourages developers to add their own control and audio routines, in the programming languages C, or with the help of other externals, in Python, Scheme, Lua, Tcl, and many others. However, Pd is also a programming language. Modular, reusable units of code written natively in Pd, called "patches" or "abstractions", are used as standalone programs and freely shared among the Pd user community, and no other programming skill is required to use Pd effectively.

It would be simpler and faster. Moreover, your conditional code \[there](https://github.com/planetsizecpu/forms/blob/master/forms.red#L344) is wrong, a block is always `true` when passed to a function expecting a condition, so your condition does not work as you want.

&gt; @9214  
They call them "patches", Pure Data, Max/MSP, vvvv and other sound synthesis languages all use that idea  
&gt; IIRC because of that this family of languages is called "patchers" or something like that

Some really old people, like me, remember this as the days when you had a patch bay, like an old phone switchboard/patch system, that you used to route signals in a studio. And because 1/4" phone jacks were pretty big, some used TT (Tiny Telephone) jacks to pack more in a smaller space.

&gt; I do remember new console having a bit slow print, comparing to native one. But IIRC @qtxie said something like it prints on per-line basis.

No, it's not "slow", the new console outputs lines as they are created, while the current console buffers all the output and only shows the end result, which creates issues when wanting to see intermediary output (there's one or more tickets about that). So, we can just show the end result like in the current console if you prefer to keep the issues?

[12:36](#msg5aa7c5c827c509a774599525)@9214 Same as the current one, as we use the same high-level console \[engine](https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/environment/console/engine.red) for all the consoles (CLI, GUI, old/new). If we want more advanced editing features, we need to duplicate that common console engine code.

[12:46](#msg5aa7c8376f8b4b9946204011)Well, most probably an accurate one :-) Btw - will not a console underlying model change to `port!`type in future? Might change some things too.

dockimbel

[04:52](#msg5aa8aa87e4d1c63604f97ccf)@BeardPower Thanks for the analysis. For the PE anomalies, they are false positives, PE sections can be freely named, and not use the same names as C compilers.

[04:55](#msg5aa8ab2d458cbde55730c5ba)"blacklisted APIs"? How can an AV decide which OS API can be used or not? We need file access, keyboard handling (as we are building our own GUI system), crypto function support, capturing screenshots (`to-image face` feature) and so on... How dumb it is to decide on the purpose of an app based on the API it is using... AVs have gone unreliable.

BeardPower

[11:21](#msg5aa905a935dd17022e5a5c34)@dockimbel Your'r welcome. Of course, section names are just intended for humans. Many AV engines/ISV use Yara for their analyses and have cheap heuristics based on the section names, used APIs and even the get EIP methods for PIC (call &lt;address&gt; pop eax; 68 00 00 00 00 58). I made a simple test, just renaming the sections. I even used two .idata sections.  
Look at the results:  
original 7/66 AV hits: https://www.virustotal.com/de/file/9a36acba0c68e93c6d32bd887ad41f717ec815c00eb7d945104197126ad004b6/analysis/  
modified section names: 5/66 AV hits: https://www.virustotal.com/de/file/dab30509350ce6fbdde62069cff90fa230acdfa934b688af97305251cc6f2f51/analysis/

Some previous trigger happy AV were now satisfied, other AVs, which did not trigger previously, complained.  
They analyze like this: Oh, the section names were changed to something different than the standard compiler output! This is suspicious behavior to hide something. Only malware does this!

It's ridiculous.

dockimbel

[11:24](#msg5aa9067335dd17022e5a5fcb)@BeardPower Indeed. Also, there is no such thing as "standard compiler output", but dominant compilers with huge market shares and others with small ones. Basically, AVs are helping big players, and penalizing new small ones. There should be some basis there for a class-action against the whole AV industry.

We have outsourced that last year to a young developer that we are planning to hire now.

I can say it was really wonderful to sit there with two people who love this language, and feel how much they care about it. Not just believing that we can change the world (we already have, but there's still a long way to go), but the deep thought that goes into details, looking both forward and back, and how much of this work happens inside their (and our) heads. The meeting of minds over a common cause and vision, which describes our entire community.

Carl did say he's revisited some old design choices, and found some things he might change, but also things you can't change, because everything crumbles if you do. \*Those* I can't share, because that's for him to do. I do believe, too, that he was really excited about the blockchain work and tokenomics, not just because it's new, or hot, but because he can see into the future and I think he sees how it could work to support FOSS, while also letting people make a living from it.

It wasn't a rapid fire technical discussion by any means. These are methodical, patient thinkers, so sparks of ideas are shared, then digested and brought up again. Fundamentally, Rebol's design is sound and Carl's new ideas don't change that. I think he's also pleased that, in Nenad, there is someone who understands Rebol in all the ways he does, respects and honors it, but is also willing to push it in new directions and see that it can be even more.

[09:03](#msg5aaa36eea60157d62fec8512)Probably time for me to sleep, before @9214 scolds me for staying up past my bedtime. ;^)

Also, I played with 1000-cows a bit, and can't trick it into being faster, whether it's the current event loop, rendering, or something else. It will be interesting to see what ideas come up, because line of business apps don't need it, but games or anything like particle systems and even real-time graphs need to be considered.

[09:36](#msg5aaa3e9dbb1018b37ae7deaf)Re Carl - I remember Bo stating, that Carl was kind of thinking about the Rebol 4. Hopefully what you describe above, are some new ideas for the language to consider. In my book (and being just a language noob), Red already introduced many innovative things. The whole toolchaing, ability to compile, I do remember how old time rebollers wished Rebol having any such capability.

[09:38](#msg5aaa3f0427c509a77465a710)As for 1000 cows, I know, that Doc is kind of versed on the simple claims of something being fast, slow, slower, whatever. The demo is surely a nice example to compare, but - where do we draw to? Base style? Is that optimal? Red might introduce trick here or there (e.g. introducing acceleration), changing the performance by an order of magnitude. Well, me thinks :-)

[13:29](#msg5aaa752ea60157d62fedd20f)@BeardPower The key thing is to put yourself into the place of a beginner (which might know C or JS but let's assume nothing more).  
First thing he looks for is a demo, to get a feel of code aesthetics and key concepts. Thankfully we have "learn X in Y minutes" but more often than not it's rather fuzzy still. So there has to be an intro in a very visible place. Not 10 or 20 intros, but one. Then suppose he starts writing code.  
2nd thing he needs is a link to a few demos (like livecode and clock and spreadsheet - these are fantastic, just should be placed somewhere where they're easily found).  
3rd is a quire reference, like mentioned  
&gt; if I get stuck on syntax I go here, http://www.red-by-example.org/index.html

Apart from golden "?" and "probe" commands this is a central point.  
And lastly, a good in-depth reference, like the one we have on VID/View/Draw etc. - when one goes into the depth of some topic one needs this.  
That's 4 links - all that's needed. Not "hey, here's how we decided to do this thing" and "look, here's how we discussed that thing" and "wow how about you learn rebol instead" and "well if don't like this you can have hundreds of other websites with partial info" etc :)

BeardPower

[13:32](#msg5aaa75dbe4ff28713a363897)The hard part to decide on is how the best "demo" for a beginner should look like.

[13:32](#msg5aaa7606f3f6d24c687a334c)@hiiamboris  
&gt; First thing he looks for is a demo

I always seek for key principles, ideas and concepts first. If language doesn't resonate with me at personal level, I won't use it.

&gt; 2nd thing he needs is a link to a few demos

Second thing I need is a good book on a subject, there each chapter is dedicated to one concept or idea

&gt; 3rd is a quire reference, like mentioned

Yes, a dictionary or cookbook

And lastly some demos and snippets to hack on

BeardPower

[13:33](#msg5aaa761ae4ff28713a363ab0)It should have a flat learning curve, stepping up the level continuously.

&gt; The key thing is to put yourself into the place of a beginner (which might know C or JS but let's assume nothing more).

That's a quite restrictive starting point. People could be coming from many different backgrounds, including no knowledge of programming at all.

Moreover, different people have different ways to learn, what you describe is your personal path for learning, mine is very different, so is probably different for each newcomer. We need to account for that and provide different entry points and different kind of learning materials (practical docs, reference docs, conceptual docs, tutorials, examples, demos, videos, etc ...). All that takes time and resources.

BeardPower

[13:36](#msg5aaa76c80a1614b712227c85)Maybe some user wants to dig into UI at the beginning, so we need some chapter dedicated to chat topic, giving a user the possibility to skip other topics, but still be able to understand the UI stuff easily.

&gt; there are 40 links on that 1st page and they do lead to another hubs of links

That's called a "table of content". It's a way to organize content in categories and sub-categories. People usually find it useful when big amount of documents are organized in such way.

BeardPower

[13:38](#msg5aaa7745e4d1c6360402335b)@dockimbel What is your way of learning? More the hack and learn? Trial and error?

9214

[13:38](#msg5aaa77456f8b4b99462d8acc)@BeardPower dialects are more or less self-contained, but there're still a need to talk to the host language in order to achieve something non-trivial, like calculating offsets in View or escaping from Parse.

dockimbel

[13:39](#msg5aaa77938f1c77ef3ac39708)@BeardPower Concepts first + little examples, then I go through the entire documentation exhaustively. I then start using the tool, then I re-read the full doc after 2-3 days, then practice, then re-read the full doc after 2 weeks.

BeardPower

[13:40](#msg5aaa77cce4d1c6360402361b)@9214 Yeah, but to draw a button, a user won't need to understand the concept of pick, reduce etc., which is good. He will get instant gratification with the basic Draw/UI dialect.

hiiamboris

[13:46](#msg5aaa791c6f8b4b99462d947f)@dockimbel I agree that some might not have a coding experience, esp. with all that smart contract thing going on. So OK, add a link, for total newbies :)  
What I want to stress is that no one's gonna read all that huge amount of docs or an in-depth book until one actually requires that info (which comes after the 1st trial phases). If you do read the full doc from the start is maybe because you are already 100% sure that you're gonna use this tool, and you probably know exactly what for. For some however these insights might come along the path, as they can't see all the applications for it yet, all the ways how and where it can be used.  
And btw it's much easier to find stuff on rebol by typing "rebol stuff" in search string than actually deciding what links to follow on that reference page ;)  
Doesn't quite work with "red" -- too common a keyword, but "stuff site:red-lang.org" works more or less...

[13:49](#msg5aaa79fb6f8b4b99462d99de)@dockimbel I have a similar approach. I want to try out stuff, as soon as I read into it a little and then go back for more.

[13:53](#msg5aaa7ac7e4ff28713a36554c)@hiiamboris That's why we need some simple to understand entry points, as @dockimbel also agreed on, which show basic, easy to understand examples. So a user can try out some features of the language without having to read tons of basic material only to get a feeling of the language.

[13:53](#msg5aaa7aec8f1c77ef3ac3aa20)Some "Hello, World!" for every word/dialect.

[13:54](#msg5aaa7b1bbb1018b37ae91f4f)So the user scan skip around different topics. If he likes what he sees/experiences, he will automatically dig into more advanced stuff and basic topics.

9214

[13:56](#msg5aaa7b83bb1018b37ae920a5)What you're talking is top-down approach. Personally, I won't touch fancy stuff until I understood the basic principles (bottom-up).

nedzadarek

[13:59](#msg5aaa7c41c3c5f8b90d75b5e4)@BeardPower I like examples. I like to copy paste some code and see it works. I don't like to read pages of doc to see something. So I agree that there should be mooore examples.

hiiamboris

[14:00](#msg5aaa7c750a1614b712229bd9)@BeardPower there's 99 bottles of beer and learn X in Y sites, but sure. Simple demos would do good. Just a few.  
And for total non-programming newbies IMO you need to realize their primary needs, why they even came to try Red, and then you write "you do this like ... this, and you do that like ... that, and also ... that". So they just copy/paste your stuff and change tiniest bits.  
@9214 OK. 5 links, you follow from the bottom, we from the top :D That's it. Let just these links be organized and present the \*\*most wanted\** part of info. IDK though how serious you are about bottom-up. Are you going to dig the source of R/S before your first hello world? :)

You're mixing concepts with implementation details.

Unbelievable! Why do AVs consider such code pattern a threat? In Red's runtime, it's used for PIC support and for reporting the address of a runtime error.

[09:37](#msg5aace1c0bb1018b37af446a6)@dockimbel  
I'm glad you asked because I need to discuss something with you (more to that later).

According to my (and others) analysis/research it's a combination of old error-prone techniques (reporting a lot of false positives) and a low setting for scoring.

There are four types/stages of analyzing. Some AV only use 1 or 2; only reliant ones are using all 4.

\*\*First stage: static analyzes + pattern matching\**  
AVs just look for a header, library, and DLL-usages, etc.: some report the .exe as packed, only because the header names are not "standard", the CryptoAPI of Windows is used or some byte patterns match the pattern of malware.  
Red:  
\- no "standard" headers -&gt; maybe packed.  
\- PE is analyzed as not being pic (pic false), but the code us using a lot of PIC "tricks".  
\*\*Very suspicious behavior.\**

\*\*Second stage: rule-based analyzes \**  
The AVs check the code based on a rule-set (just like spam-filters). Some malicious docs use "e8 00 00 00 00 58|59....". If this rule is triggered, it's score will be accumulated with the scores of other rules.  
Red:  
\- packed executable or maybe a document file  
\- found the e8 pattern, which is having a rule-set  
\*\*Very suspicious behavior.\**

\*\*Third stage: dynamic/hybrid analyzes \**  
The AV runs part of the code of the checked file in a VM/sandbox. It logs opened files, registry behavior, memory access (e.g. a lot of copies are seen as malicious), decryption/encryption, moving files  
Red:  
\- it evaluates code (REPL)  
\- uses a lot of DLL-imports like Crypto, file manipulation, memory access/copies etc.  
\*\*Very suspicious behavior.\**

\*\*Fourth stage: pure dynamic analyzes and heuristics\**  
The AV not only runs part of the code of the checked file in a VM/sandbox but also monitors its behavior.

What does the code do to the opened files, which files are modified, what is the modifications, does it encrypt/decrypt files does it scan memory locations, does it alter its code, which URLs does it visit and what is pulled from those?  
Red:  
\- it does not do anything of this, and the reliable AVs do not flag it accordingly  
\*\*No suspicious behavior\**

Many AVs, which report the file as "malware," only incorporate stage 1 and 2, but not so much 3 and 4. The better ones are just using stage 4 because the other stages report a lot of false-positives.

Now back to the thing I wanted to discuss with you. There is a service, which runs a stage 1-4 analyzer. It's using the same technologies, a modern and reliable AV engine would perform, but with the difference, that you will get a very detailed report of the stages. You can see, why the stages trigger.  
What's the catch? Well, there is a free version and a pro version. The difference is that the latter will provide more details, and more in-depth analysis and your results are not published, they are kept private, but it's not free. It's targeted for companies.  
The free version also has only a maximum of 30 analyses/month, five analyses/day on Windows and Android with limited analysis output.  
So, before having a big report on a Red executable public available, I wanted to check in with you, if you are okay with that. Maybe you even want to register the Red foundation for the pro version (it also has a 30-day trial) or some specific files to check on.

Maybe it would be a good investment for future analysis? It's the best you can get in regards to the question: Why the heck are AVs reporting my files as a threat?  
I don't know the price of the pro license, as you need to contact them for it.

[02:14](#msg5aaf1cf7c3c5f8b90d893ec2)@miguelrochefort We're working on 7Guis \[entries for Red](https://github.com/dockimbel/7guis/tree/master/Red), though on spare time only. It's just a first take at it, the code can be further simplified and reduced. There should be some FizzBuzzs versions around. No TodoMVC so far, though, it could be made very easily too.

CodingFiend\_twitter

[05:35](#msg5aaf4c05bb1018b37afd379a)I don't find that the 7guis programs tell you much. Each one of them has massive assumptions that you have a windowing system, and stress text entry. Text entry is almost completely built on the underlying OS's code, who renders their own text? Well, Flutter, AS3 runtime, Android, OSX, Windows, iOS do, and probably webkit does (never bothered to check). So asking for all these default options is basically pushing it back to the OS or support system. And how many languages handle the code for text entry fields in the language? None. So comparing languages which are all merely calling into the OS on the very few functions which cannot be done on your own (who dares to handle the caret in a text entry field on their own, I did in my Discus labeler, and of course it fails on Hebrew)

[05:37](#msg5aaf4cb3e4d1c636041632da)Thats the problem with TodoMVC. The more you emphasize text entry in some language test, less information you will gain, since languages don't handle text entry. There is around a million lines of code inside the various input editor layers to support the dozens of human languages. In Japan they still sell plugins for different approaches to the kana-kanji-henkan problem (conversion from a phonetic input to the ambiguous chinese symbols).

[05:40](#msg5aaf4d36f3f6d24c688e01f2)Thats why i like the clock, the snake, the tic tac toe, and the chess, because those stress the language, not the OS. We have no choice on a given platform but to use the core OS features, and the single defining reason OS's are so few in quantity is the text entry field. There is more code in handling the text entry field than in an OS. We all have seen micokernel OS's in literature that are tiny, lean mean machines, in the same style as Red, but they all fail to gain traction because none of them can implement a text entry field.

[05:42](#msg5aaf4dc2fa066c53254686f9)there is also the issue of font rendering. I would estimate less than 100 people on planet earth know the the truetype language. it is a bizarre language with all sorts of geometry primitives. The text entry problem is so tough that Apple just last month had to issue a path for IOS because it was crashing on certain Telegu words.

Its quite sad that academia which has the luxury of huge funding in the aggregate, is no longer making much effort in the language area. Basic/Pascal/Modula2/Oberon/Miranda so many examples of academic origin languages, but i can't think of a notable entry from academia in the last 10 years. Instead it is all industry nowadays, with Dart/Go/Swift/etc. from the giant firms.

Looks like I'll just have to find time for exploring these in more depth. Couldn't find any real link on Beads though. Is that your project? What's the state of it?  
And an interesting blog you have there by the way (:

9214

[05:26](#msg5ab09b75e4ff28713a514c1a)@dockimbel, what do you think about introducing new Parse keyword for referring to "current" rule? For example, here's how I usually flatten a block:

```
rule: [any [ahead block! into rule | keep skip]]
parse [a [b [c]]][collect rule]
```

And here's how it might look like with proposed keyword:

```
parse [a [b [c]]][
    collect [
        [any [ahead block! into THIS | keep skip]]
    ]
]
```

IMO, it simplifies recursive grammars a bit.

dockimbel

[05:27](#msg5ab09bb327c509a774816f45)@9214 Those two examples are not equivalent. Your "current rule" does not include `any`. Actually your concept of "current rule" is not clearly defined. In your example, `into` is the current rule. That rule is part of a block-rule, which is a sub-rule of `any`.

9214

[05:27](#msg5ab09bbb27c509a774816f56)Indeed, just noticed. Fixed?

[05:30](#msg5ab09c61458cbde557549fd3)Ah, I see what you mean. It would be technically hard to implement.

dockimbel

[05:31](#msg5ab09cbb5f188ccc15d60896)Naming rules explicitly with words is part of idiomatic Parse usage. It makes Parse rules more easily readable.

9214

[05:31](#msg5ab09cbf27c509a774817345)Maybe somehow mark desired rule block, akin to `collect keep` combo?

[05:32](#msg5ab09ceae4d1c636041cd19e)I agree with that, but sometimes recursive definitions like this one trip me up a little.

dockimbel

[05:33](#msg5ab09d346f8b4b9946484d81)It would trip you up even more if you had to think/search about what is `into` diving into. In the current way, it's explicit, one less thing to think about. ;-)

&gt; Once the focus in on performance, it would be nice if its comparable to Haxe and Nim.

They are both statically typed, Red is not. Nim is system programming language, so it can compare in performance with Red/System, but Red is in another, much higher-level realm. Not sure about Haxe, but I guess, it's a quite low-level language too, compared to Red. Though, "strict" Red should be able to get much closer.

BeardPower

[12:14](#msg5ab0fb3935dd17022e7de6a2)@dockimbel I was referring to R/S, yes. Sorry :) Haxe has various backends, which the Haxe code is compiled to. E.g. Flash, JS or C++. It works a little like Nim.

So this is like a function description, which helps you to define what should be in the function and what that function should return. It also can generate data based on spec for generics tests (which is awesome). In Elixir you can define your "types" for spec like @spec my\_function\_name(val1 :: Strint.t. val2 :: Map.t) :: MyAwesomeType

&gt; I don't find that the 7guis programs tell you much. Each one of them has massive assumptions that you have a windowing system, and stress text entry.

@CodingFiend\_twitter, I'm catching up, so may miss later chat on this, but the importance of examples like 7GUIs is that people build and need these kinds of apps, yes? So it's about the pragmatic application of languages, and I think the examples in that project show the wide variety of effort required using various tools. I think he's also cleaned the repo up some lately, so not all the old examples are still there.

They have a very bad reputation in China, we sent them some false positive reports, but they just ignore them. They have no marketshare out of China AFAIK, so not a big concern.

You need to make sure you understand the language and its rules before criticizing it. What you refer to as "keys" are no such thing in the a block. A block is just a sequence of values, and there is no such value as a number that ends in a colon. There are a lot of reasons for that, which is too much for this message.

[02:09](#msg5ab1bec4e4ff28713a57444b)@m\_a\_j\_ch\_rz\_a\_k\_twitter, good thoughts and questions, \*however\*, I'm going to suggest that you spend more time with Red before suggesting it adopt specific features from other languages. The team is experienced, deeply and widely read, and knows what else is out there in semi-mainstream languages. i.e., those that aren't way out of the fringe.

Things like HOF and concurrency are planned, with much thought already given to them, but no design frozen yet. The key is not to look at other langs and what seems to work well there, but to look at fundamental concepts, ideas that boil down to simple kernels of functionality we can build other models on and, most importantly, what we'd do working from a clean slate, to maintain the conceptual integrity that is so important to Red.

Rebol was designed as a messaging language. Viewed through that lens, as a tool for processing, storing, and coordinating exchanged messages, between people and machines, draft ideas we can discuss and build on.

&gt; Formed in 2012, so maybe also not a big concern. So, using UPX, the newest version of Red and the most actual AV definitions and we are safe :)

Do you have an exhaustive list of changes/fixes we need to apply to generated Red executables to bring down the supposed threat level? Or do you mean, just upx-ing the exe and we're done?

BeardPower

[02:23](#msg5ab1c23b35dd17022e81fb0a)@dockimbel To please all AVs except the Chinese and the newer one, you only have to use UPX. To bring the score a little lower, you would need to rename the section names.

[02:27](#msg5ab1c327fa066c5325532fbe)I need to make some more tests regarding the EIP stuff. Some AVs liked it, others did not.

I can write a list, but it's not that exhaustive. Patching out the Redbin in the data section was only a minor issue. Some AV were not recognizing the packer format, which will be solved with UPXing the executable, because some don't even extract it. They are fine with seeing the UPX string.

dockimbel

[02:31](#msg5ab1c3f4fa066c53255331a2)@BeardPower That means we should make UPX part of our toolchain, because our users will run into the same issues when compiling their Red apps. Can UPX be compiled as a shared lib?

BeardPower

[02:43](#msg5ab1c6c3c3c5f8b90d96c560)@dockimbel Yes. UPX solves a lot of issues. I just tried and it compiled as a shared lib without errors. It's mostly assembler and C++.

The website does not have the newest Defender definitions yet. So it's really 4/64 and 1/63.

It seems some AV cannot even scan the non packed exe. They rely heavily on the static analysis of the section names.

[03:28](#msg5ab322d6bb1018b37a103956)e.g., I have an old experiment that let you write

        artist

[08:35](#msg5ab36ad95f188ccc15e37fd0)@DideC `/into` is expanding the block, it may be the source of slowdown

dockimbel

[08:35](#msg5ab36ae827c509a7748ee748)@DideC Two reasons:  
\* In `reduce` native implementation, for the `/into` branch it relies on a full blown \[`insert`](either into? \[actions/insert* -1 0 -1]\[block/append\*]) action, while it will use a low-level append function otherwise. `/into` is more versatile, as it can insert data anywhere in the target series. We could add a fast-path if the target series is at tail, to match the speed of the regular reducing. You can open a ticket for it, it should be a quick fix.  
\* Even with that fix, your test will not be valid, because the target block (`draw`) is not preallocated with the necessary size (3000), so you will add the overhead of the reallocations to the `/into` test.

So Carl (maker of REBOL, Red is based on) was probably considering REBOL style names like Print-Line and Print initially, but it seems conciseness of prin and print won out, likely because these are such heavily used functions.

That said, and I don't have time to think deeply about it right now, it's just pushing the problem around, and will likely be worse in the long run. We're talking about very different types, and if you want to coerce them, you should do so explicitly.

[05:06](#msg5ab48b51458cbde55767a82d)@hiiamboris You raise an interesting point with singular paths, and I agree that it can be very disturbing the first time you encounter them. Though, there's a lot to say about it and the implications about any change to the current behavior. It's a deep and important topic, so should we discuss it on /r/redlang or somewhere else, as otherwise it will be quickly lost in this channel (and anyway, hard to follow)?

I also don't get what is the point you are trying to make there? Evaluating a function or getting a function value are two different operations supported by two different literal word syntaxic sugars. Though, words are not necessary to invoke functions or retrieve their value, so maybe that's the part you're missing?

&gt; And "prin" does not say anything.

But `println` surely does! What does it do, prints natural logarithm (ln)?

Jokes aside, I have a couple of advices for you: first, low down your expectations a bit, because Red \*is still in alpha\*. Some things are slower than they should be, and everything always breaks. There's no package manager yet, GC is yet to be merged in master.  
Second - Red \*is* different. This means that it has different things to say about programming, and that it doesn't have all the shiny things from most mainstream languages that you expect to see. Instead it gives you better tools for thought and for getting the job done. Regex vs. Parse is one example - Parse is strictly more powerful than regexes, both because it's from TDPL family, and because it is not limited to string parsing. Mutation vs. Purity which all FP fans value, is another thing - without Mutation Red and Rebol will lost &gt;50% of their charm.

[08:00](#msg5ab4b42f458cbde557684dd7)@prapro I don't think `bind` has anything to do with my example, unless I misunderstand something?

[10:07](#msg5ab4d1c5fa066c53256165c9)@miguelrochefort as for fractalmvc it just came from my need in a project - many years ago so I don't remember well - of being able as product owner (that's the role I often have) to check that complex business rules are indeed implemented the way it should be and I couldn't as it was financial simulator with a lot of hierarchy of graphics mixing sinus and cosinus for the view and these rules, I asked for separation. They couldn't see how, so I told them to do "fractal MVC" during first month they just jerked, I have to make 3 of them come to France and afterwards they could do it and the most ferocious opponent even then evangilize it at his company :smile: So I'm afraid it would be difficult to explain but roughly if you have already an idea of Naked Object Architecture, it's a generalization by unification of my simple but operational definition of MVC :

```
M=Variable/Component under Observation, 
V=Projection of M on several Viewpoints, 
Controller=holds the transformation rules
```

which is just relative because each M, or V or C when zooming is itself a MVC so the fractal aspect. In my vision the whole system should "boot" like an OS by cascading a series of events building the whole infrastructure of components. Reactive is for making projection from M to V, it is unidirectional (never 2 ways binding) so that M is always the source of truth (since language like c# is not reactive Controller is used as Single Point of Control to access the Model), idea that is today adopted by flux or redux architecture.

Every programming language paradigms has something to offer. Even Java introduced some FP some time ago.  
Last time I changed `change` by accident. It was hard to find that bug. I wish there were some way to `protect` it or at least warn user. (I think people work on `protect` from Rebol)

9214

[11:26](#msg5ab4e44f5f188ccc15ea5dd6)@nedzadarek yes, Rebol has `protect` and `unprotect`, which Red will surely introduce in the future (I think once modules are shipped in `0.8.0`).

[11:39](#msg5ab4e760e4ff28713a65efd1)What Red should borrow from FP, IMO, is means for function compositions, which should be carefuly integrated in the language, so as not to break its design coherence. In functional languages, the basic unit for building abstractions are functions, but in Redbol it is, as funny as it sounds, code (and data) itself.

m\_a\_j\_ch\_rz\_a\_k\_twitter

[12:05](#msg5ab4ed8835dd17022e90a0c4)@9214 immutability is popular because people after years of struggling with the same problem are trying to find solutions. This is not a silver bullet. 10-20 years ago you didn't have multicore processors, machine learning for a big scale, processing that amount of complicated data. Yes, of course, that you can say that C++, C design is an answer for everything, but 20 years ago the most expensive part of the project were machines, now humans, and human mistakes. This is the reason for static typing in new languages, as same as immutability.  
Projects are way more complicated, that is the reason of searching better-fitted paradigms for that kind of problems.  
Last but not least...please try to write something highly concurent with mutable data. You can ... of course that you can do that but this is like a using hammer to paint the wall. Wrong tool for the wrong task. "Riiight, and that's because people still use it on a daily basis in their hobbies and jobs.

If you see Red and Rebol as degradation from the true way of doing stuff and as poorly designed languages, just because it allows code and data to be mutated, when it's not the right tool for you, that's all I can say. Yet, I suggest you to try and appreciate what it gives you, before coming to such conclusions.

[12:28](#msg5ab4f304e3d0b1ff2c5c51eb)Everything, be it mutability, concurrency or functional composition, is harmful when you can't manage it properly and when you abuse the feature without a second thought.

What I say is that in Redbol \*manageable* mutability (the one that has well-defined boundaries) is a good and expressive thing, which you should leverage if you want to master our ways. If you don't want to - it's your loss.

&gt; 10-20 years ago you didn't have multicore processors

15 years ago we got dual cores, with quad core desktop processors for 10 years now.

&gt; Cobol is more widely used then Red and Robol connected....that is mean that Cobol is well designed?

COBOL should easily outrank many languages, still. There's a \*lot* to be said for COBOL, and it broke a lot of new ground. It gets its fair share of criticism as well. I could argue that it was well, if not perfectly, designed, based on how much useful work has been done with it. That is, it worked as expected and did what it was designed to do.

&gt; Now the main question should be if Red would be a copy of Rebol or it would be like a Scala for Java ...with FP additions, immutability, actors, purity.

This is an easy one. Red is a direct descendant of Rebol, and that is fundamental to its design. I think @maximvl has done some strong typing experiments, and @numberjay did https://gist.github.com/numberjay/3df8f13044145c6dde1918ea2cdfe3b8, and other things can be built on top of Red's foundation for those who want them.

&gt; Rebol is really cool with the syntax and the idea but it is a little bit outdated.

What, specifically, do you think is outdated about it?

Beyond this, we know the arguments for static typing and immutability. The features of a language need to align with its goals, intended use and, most importantly, its vision. Can we agree on that? You can't just combine features willy-nilly and expect to create a great language.

To avoid `forever ["Red should be immutable" "No it shouldn't"]`, assume we understand what immutability is, and the arguments in support of it; and we have decided that Red will not be immutable at its core. Now, make your case of for it concretely. Provide examples you have written, showing how it helped you, or how it would be better (not just different). Cite studies, provide context, and open your mind to The Red Way. Pose \*actual* problems, and let's see how we each approach and solve them. Nobody can win a feature or popularity war, but maybe we can all learn and make the future better.

[20:14](#msg5ab5602ee4ff28713a688a43)@JacobGood1 you can do anything even in assembly language, it's about productivity and mental model mapping. I remember the time the assembly guys didn't even understand why C was needed. Same for C Guys towards C++ guys. I contend that today the level of professional applications (real-time, interfaçing with many systems, complex UI that don't look like it is 2000, PWA and complex business that need to be clearly separated from the technical layers etc.) requires more than an expressive language or dsl because the complexity doesn't lie there when it's a big application.

I say foundation, because the tools are "bare bones" for now, vs Racket, which has had far more time to mature.

[05:16](#msg5ab5df26f3f6d24c68ad8ae1)Racket has zero chance of becoming a major language. It has an archaic structure that is clearly influenced by LISP, which is ancient. It has a number and string data type, and then the usual hash tables and dictionaries. It is about the same level of Python, but significantly harder to read. A true next generation language is going to attack the central unsolved problem of reducing programmer error, and meta programming languages like Racket are notoriously fragile, and if anything magnify the probability of error. In the hands of an expert, i have no doubt that Racket is wonderful, but is LISP and many other transformational languages. The acid test for a language is, take a large code base, give it to a junior employee whose never seen it before and have them make some requested change, without breaking something else in the program. In the test cases i am building, for example, one of the tougher programs is a chess playing program, and you hand the program to a different person than the author, and have them allow pawns to move 3 squares in the beginning. See how long it takes, and if any new bugs get introduced.

[05:22](#msg5ab5e08fe3d0b1ff2c607815)a modern language is going to have data types like color, gradient, image, sound, movie, a database built-in, some way to handle user and internet events, a way of capturing sessions, a way of synchronizing things; racket is still pretending people are on terminals doing monospaced text... sorry but terminals are long gone.

Gartner keeps complaining about the high rate of failure of software projects https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/it-projects-need-less-complexity-not-more-governance/: "The failure rate of IT projects remains appalling. " Latest hype about Agile (I'm for Agile so I'm not criticizing Agile per se) didn't change that state very much because the core system of software design is not adequate. What Gartner says, I actually experience it in big corporate projects from 1 million $ to 30 millions $ budgets personnally (I did manage only partly at most 10 million $), the competencies of developers are diminishing (you can watch one of Bob Martin video, he acknowledge that also) while complexity of softwares are increasing especially when languages like organization work in silo so you have heavy weighted webservices even for communicating on the same machine. Language designers tend not to even realize the problem as Deming would say ;)

[01:17](#msg5abaed3fc574b1aa3e3d67ad)I probably mentioned I've been experimenting in writing a \*\*simplistic pure functional dialect\** and get to know Red better this way ;) Since it's more or less working, those interested (namely @lepinekong\_twitter was) can have a look at it here: https://github.com/hiiamboris/red-pure-fun

There's a readme that explains most of it there. Currently it's fun to play with but the performance is so poor that it's just pointless to use :D I clearly underestimated the impact on the block-based lookup that a big recursion depth will have. So I would \*\*welcome any ideas on performance or other criticism\** you very knowledgeable people may provide.

I had these ideas:  
\- put the scope context into a \*\*map\*\*, modify it on every function call, then restore the backed up values, but I'm not sure if it'll not slow things down even more, as maps are usually optimized for lookup speed, not the insertion  
\- if map is used, then maybe use the whole pattern \*\*spec\** as a \*\*key\** for the map  
\- learn me some \*\*R/S\** and port the pattern tree traversal part onto it (although then it won't highlight the power of Red, will it?)

There's also some auxiliary stuff in there that many a coder might find useful, namely:  
\- an easy to use \*\*profiler\** that can be just attached to any function to see it's total execution time  
\- \*\*assert\** function that I've been using a lot and that saved me from numerous headaches already  
\- general-purpose \*\*iterator\** over arbitrary data (the data provide itself defines a means for iteration)

&gt; put the scope context into a map  
&gt; if map is used, then maybe use the whole pattern spec as a key for the map

If your stored keys in the map are of `any-block!` type, they will not be hashed, so your lookup in the map is a O(n^2). You would get better performance by storing them in a simple block and searching for them using `find/same` or `select/same`. Why such values are not hashed is a big topic.

An alternative is to write your own hashing function for blocks (in R/S ideally), and use that hash as the key in maps.

dander

[22:35](#msg5abc18c7c574b1aa3e431c89)@9214 Oh yeah, there is that generator stuff. I haven't compared it to @hiiamboris general-purpose iterator yet, but I imagine they are for similar purposes. I really need to get back to that and clean it up at some point. Regarding immutable blocks, I think it's a useful piece for functional style programming because one of the goals is to eliminate mutable state in your functions as much as possible to reduce the chance of side effects leaking across your application.

9214

[22:40](#msg5abc19e65f188ccc150938b6)@dander it could be useful, but I find it troublesome to fit functional concepts in Redbol design "as-is", without carefully refining them and nipping underlying problem in the bud.

dander

[22:44](#msg5abc1ab7270d7d37086d1b26)I agree. It will be fun to experiment with different ways of doing it. I think as long as these tools are fairly self-contained, it should be easy to compose them together in different ways to see how different models work

9214

[22:44](#msg5abc1acd270d7d37086d1b6a)I mean, I think there are other ways to solve problems that FP tries to solve, and they can be a better fit for Red. We can't blindly mash stuff together and expect everything to be nice and coherent.

[22:44](#msg5abc1ae427c509a774b456d8)@dander yeah, what this example nicely show is that Red is a great (and extensible) tool for thinking and doing quick-n-dirty PoC and prototypes.

hiiamboris

[22:46](#msg5abc1b38270d7d37086d1cdb)@dander I've seen your generators. Great stuff! Although what I dislike about both your and mine code is that (1) to bind we have to copy and (2) run-time function generation has an overhead... if only we could just copy an already constructed function and rebind it's body it could have been faster...

dander

[22:46](#msg5abc1b3ebb1018b37a36e1c9)yeah, that makes sense. It's good to separate the problems from the practices, and not get bogged down by the dogmas of things

9214

[22:46](#msg5abc1b63c4d0ae800710e146)@hiiamboris FYI, you can rebind function's body. It's just a block after all.

hiiamboris

[22:47](#msg5abc1b75458cbde5578828f5)@9214 but can I copy a function before that?

9214

[22:47](#msg5abc1b87c4d0ae800710e232)@hiiamboris depends on what you mean by copying.

hiiamboris

[22:48](#msg5abc1ba4c4d0ae800710e2c8)@9214 I mean it has only 1 body and this body may be used in a few contexts at the same time

[22:48](#msg5abc1bcec4d0ae800710e3a7)should I rebind it while it's executing... I don't expect great things

9214

[22:51](#msg5abc1c59270d7d37086d2301)@hiiamboris kinda like this?

```
>> body: [x + y]
== [x + y]
>> do context [x: 1 y: 2 return bind body self]
== 3

```

[22:53](#msg5abc1cd0c4d0ae800710e7d6)there's also `bind/copy`, which preserves bindings in original block and instead makes a copy.

[22:55](#msg5abc1d7b5f188ccc15094a2c)Not in a usual `copy` sense I believe, only `any-word!`s (less overhead).

[23:03](#msg5abc1f3727c509a774b46861)@9214 I think you're right, maybe the fastest way will be to forget about functions and use `do` on rebound copied blocks, and have a free list with contexts to bind to, just fetch one from the list when it's needed, then put back...

9214

[23:20](#msg5abc232be3d0b1ff2c7b19fe)@hiiamboris your iterator is applicable to series only, right?

hiiamboris

[23:35](#msg5abc26ad458cbde557885a65)@9214 nope, I'm using it to iterate over a tree of lists and contexts, it's just a minimal interface that the data provider has to define in order to iterate over the data

which is a nested series.

[23:36](#msg5abc26f2e3d0b1ff2c7b2964)I mean, you can't iterate over, say, integer or object.

[23:55](#msg5abc2b80c574b1aa3e4368f8)But just to outline the point. While a generator from a counter is fancy, it's not practical. What I wanted there is to make sure once I change the format of the tree I won't have to totally rewrite every piece of code that iterates over the tree. It's the \*\*separation\** that's important.

9214

[23:57](#msg5abc2bd535dd17022eaf2e0e)@hiiamboris but you still need to tweak the iterator description?

[23:58](#msg5abc2c14270d7d37086d5c9c)I'm asking because I'm thinking of rolling out my own attempt at this ideas, to compare your and @dander views and approaches.

## Thursday 29th March, 2018

hiiamboris

[00:05](#msg5abc2db9c4d0ae8007112655)@9214 honestly, I could care less about descriptions there ;)  
My model is as follows:  
\- You have a function that takes the data and creates and returns an iterator of a known interface that would go over that data. Name it how you like, I used "over-something" naming scheme. Put description into it or whatever. It is provided by the object that maintains the data.  
\- And you have a general iterating function that takes an iterator, a list of values to set, and a piece of code. It doesn't know the format of the data, only that of an iterator.  
\- The piece of code only knows what values the iterator will return on each invocation, so I guess you're gonna put that into the over-something generator spec block.

[00:11](#msg5abc2f42270d7d37086d6857)Then it even looks natural: `rollin' [a b c] over-weird-data data [..code..]`  
Sometimes I wanted just the 1st batch of items - easy:  
`it: over-weird-data data`  
`rollin' 'triple it [triple1: triple break]`  
Then continue on the `it`. And no need to expose any internals.

[10:47](#msg5abe15d9270d7d37087597de)Two remarks: `repeat w 10000` may be replaced by `loop 10000` since `w` does not occur in the body; intriguingly, `map` is based on `hash`, so it is indeed funny that `put` in `hash` is slower.!

[10:54](#msg5abe1749c574b1aa3e4bae44)I checked with the sources, and `put` for `hash` is handled by `block` whereas `put` for `map` is handled by `eval-path` for `map`. Perhaps @dockimbel could have another look at the algorithms...

[12:14](#msg5ac3702026a769820b2b57b0)@BeardPower right, it's not included when building form rebol, thing is if we include it, how do we know nothing has been changed to the sources? For Team it's important that issues are tested against official builds. It could be included in sources but as said, no guarantee that sources have not been modified locally. Could not be included in git clone as that would require an extra commit after each commit and would show the before the last commit.. messy. It's included if you build from rebol SDK as that builds the toolchain and it's useful for Team working on different branches at different HEAD. Ideas and suggestions on how to improve mostly welcome! @dockimbel what do you think?

However, on my Windows10 the item corresponding to `system/platform/build` is not an integer, like `16299` but it looks like a float, e.g. `16299.309`.

Lucky enough there was already more detailed platform information in View and @qtxie jumped in, unified and extend it under `system/platform` using proper system calls.  
`system/build/platform` needs to be of type `string!` as different OSs return different data (on macOS it is something like `17E199`while on Linux it could be `#1 SMP Debian 4.9.65-3+deb9u2`).  
Is your reported value of `16299.309` of type `string!`? What would be the full information in your case?  
Btw your wish to have commit hash of length 7 like github uses has been granted in the return data of `about`, while full length is now returned from `system/build/git/commit` as @rebolek suggested.

[01:26](#msg5ac96fd4270d7d3708a39f44)@AlexanderBaggett There are two dialects, one is a high-level one that gets translated to the low-level one. The high-level dialect (called RTD) is easy to write for humans, the low-level dialect is optimized for hardware-accelerated rendering. A simple RTD example from VID:

```

More done on the drag-n-drop Gui layout maker. still a lot can be done with this one. As before not sure if it is, or will be of any use to anyone.  
The 'backdrop' changes background colour, the 'Title' changes the title, 'Save it' saves the script, the 'Try it' runs the script, the 'Clear it' clears the layout area. I added a code view window which is updated when the widget is dragged or edited from the popup.  
Drag a face onto the layout area and click to register it, a properties edit window will pop up. Only a few properties can be edited so far.  
Will do more on this when i get chance. More editable 'properties' and more 'widgets' will come soon.

&gt;why is this an issue? i don't see it. it will go something like this:

There is the issue with truncating. You will lose information from casting a `float!`to an `integer!`.

[15:09](#msg5acf76ad270d7d3708bdb7b9)1.2 days is one day and 20% of a day !

BeardPower

[15:09](#msg5acf76b55d7286b43a2097d2)@DideC Yeah, how would the language differentiate between 1.2 days and 1.2 as in 1 day and 2 hours?

9214

[15:10](#msg5acf76cd6d7e07082be8bc52)@ifmihai except that you're not using Excel here, and that Red probably has different implementation of `date!` datatype.

&gt; i was talking about usefulness and habits. excel is way more popular than red anyway for anything with numbers

@ifmihai, I'll add comments to your ticket, but I did want to point out that the above statements are not strong arguments for adding this behavior to Red. Things are rarely, truly intuitive. They only seem that way in retrospect. :^) Saying we should do what Excel does, because it's popular, is simply an appeal to authority. That said, I love the spreadsheet model, and we want to build more things like that with Red, so this is an important discussion.

What we need to consider in Red:

1\. People need to understand how actions work, given a datatype and argument(s). We can justify it in that regard.  
2\. The add int = add days behavior came from Rebol. Why did Carl choose not to support floats as you suggest? That is, what might be the cases against this?  
3\. (date! + float!) &lt;&gt; (date! + to time! float!). May be confusing, but see #1.  
4\. You can't `make/to` between date! and float!. Do we need to support that as well, for this request to be more complete?  
5\. If we do #4, it may complicate both date! and time! datatypes. Noting that, today, date! is not a single float! value, but date and time components are separate values in the type structure.  
6\. Excel has no concept of timezone, correct? What do we do about that? Normalizing to UTC will be a lossy conversion in the simplest case, yes?

I also have a few spreadsheet financial funcs (pv, irr, etc.) from years ago.

@ifmihai, quite often, the best way to promote changes to Red is to prove their usefulness first. We can easily roll a library of funcs to give us spreadsheet-like affordances. If you live in Excel, you'd be a great candidate to weigh in on things done in that area.

adding any number of days does not affect the TZ in any way  
plus, dates are usually held internally in UTC, for monotony's sake, and only when being formatted do they add/subtract TZ hours

\*Currently\*, `time!` values are stored internally as a 64-bit float, with precision limited to microseconds (10 \** -6). `Date!` values \*contain* time values, but the two are separate. The date component is a varying number of bits per segment. i.e., the minimum number of bits needed for each part. The year part has 15 bits (signed) allocated. So not suitable for astronomy. As https://doc.red-lang.org/en/date.html says, they are Gregorian calendar dates.

nedzadarek

[20:16](#msg5ad2618327c509a774115b64)@hiiamboris what do you mean by saying "it's precision best near zero"? Correct me if I'm wrong but single/double precision floats have 3 fields &lt;sign&gt;&lt;exponent&gt;&lt;mantisa&gt; where sign = `-` or `+`, exponent = 1e +/- N (e.g. 10e-10) and mantisa is your number (e.g. 21). So if your mantisa has less or equal number of bits than 22/52 bits then "position" relative to zero doesn't matter (`(42e-42 * 1e42) = (42e42 * 1e-42)`)

[02:03](#msg5ad94a845d7286b43a49a294)&gt; what is the canonical way to impress a lisper with red?

@pbaille :point\_up: \[April 19, 2018 8:01 AM](https://gitter.im/red/red?at=5ad8a137270d7d3708e3a381) I didn't know Lispers could \*be* impressed, except when you tell them you use Lisp. ;^) Joking aside, there is no single answer. For some, it might be that Red doesn't need macros, doesn't evaluate blocks by default, or is really never code (just data). For others it may be the GUI system. Still others might like that we can trick Lisp-haters into using Lisp because most of the parens are hidden. :^) On the other hand, they may lose their minds when they see free ranging evaluation and learn there is no scope. So be careful. ;^)

This ticket raised a question... In R2 they have `func [:x][x] = func ['x][get x]`  
But R3 does not support this, and in R3 `func [:x][x] = func ['x][x]`  
And in Red we also have the R3 behaviour.  
Does anybody know if R3 intentionally \*dropped* this feat or just never arrived to the point of \*supporting* it? And if Red has plans to do it the R2-way or will it remain as is in R3?

9214

[09:10](#msg5adda315270d7d3708f6c0e5)@hiiamboris R3 enhanced R2 syntax, as far as I know. Red sticks to R3 convention, unless there're enough reasons to drop it and switch back to R2.

The current \[red source repository](https://github.com/red/red) will now be exclusively used for managing the Red code base. Red Enhancement Proposals and wishes will be handled via the new \[Red REP repository](https://github.com/red/REP).

REPs are stored in AsciiDoc format in the repository and will be managed using git pull requests. A "Discussion" issue for each REP will be used to facilitate and record discussions about them.

Wishes can be submitted via "Wish" issues, they will be resolved with one of three outcomes: granted, rejected, or referred to the Red Enhancement Process. Once they are resolved, the "Wish" issue will be closed. For granted wishes, a "task.type.wish" issue will be opened in the Red code base repository to track the implementation of the wish.

The REP and wish process will be updated to be based on RED tokenomics in the future.

[13:02](#msg5ae1cdda62316e050501215b)@greggirwin You mentioned building console for XP. Probably that wouldn't be useful anymore. I tested a small GUI app in XP and got "Cannot find entry point GetGestureInfo in USER32.DLL". This is because that entry point became available in Win7. So, probably Vista is also a dead end ... So, using Xp or Vista will be at least limited and only possible with older Red version??

[05:39](#msg5ae6ac1a2d0e228d7bc76bde)Be aware that a number of wiki page names have changed. We'll need to update links to them, and any bookmarks you have. The problem was that things work fine if you \*only* edit directly in github, but as soon as you clone the repo, invalid characters for the local file system cause problems. For now, I've replaced colons with double underscores, but we can try to find something better. There are still a few odd names that might be changed, and github uses dashes for spaces in file names.

@dockimbel @greggirwin I've posted my thoughts on objects to reddit, for convenience

9214

[16:48](#msg5ae89a756d98e53e0443e11f)@hiiamboris you're now a blue-eyed boy in some not so distant enclaves, congratulations. I agree that inheritance and prototype-based programming in Redbol could be done better, though, all your examples make sense to me (up to `construct`, I need to read up on it and experiment by myself).

hiiamboris

[17:39](#msg5ae8a65297e5506e048c29d6)@9214 ;)  
I believe R2 results there are the most expected, and Red should at the very minimum fulfill these expectations too. But see, this is beyond bugs... all in all I think this subject should be better emphasized (hopefully that reddit post will serve this purpose). People used to OOP might think \*"hey, there's objects, I can copy these and extend - cool! Oh, look - the View system is made of nested objects, so Red must support OOP too!"\*, and try to implement OOP constructs they're used to - \*in Red* - even though simple ones, and then suddenly find themselves over their head in the surprising results their code produces. Instead, everyone should be aware of how things really work and what to do or not to do with objects, and \*design their logic upfront armed with this knowledge\*. For that purpose - I believe - it is imperative to expose all the pitfalls.

[17:50](#msg5ae8a8e140f24c4304450150)Another point that the topic shows is how easy it is for the language designer to break the whole mechanism. Just look how different are the results, albeit how simple is the test piece.

greggirwin

[22:41](#msg5ae8ed1f0a9c956f041b4234)@hiiamboris, I agree that it would be great to have an explanation of object creation, how `make/copy/construct` differ in behavior, and note that functions are rebound. https://github.com/red/red/wiki/Object-Notes is the place to do that. That said, calling the design "brittle" is not accurate. Approaching things with a positive view may net nicer feedback. Do you potentially need to understand the design? Yes. Can you do things in Red that may seem confusing, or be hard to maintain? You bet. Differing behavior between language implementations only matters if there's a clear right/wrong answer. That's not the case here.

We need to ask:

\- What behavior did you expect in a given case, compared to what you got?  
\- Is there a good reason for the design and current behavior?  
\- Can we explain and defend it?  
\- If not, what should change?  
\- Is the change unilaterally better, or a different set of tradeoffs?

&gt; Another point that the topic shows is how easy it is for the language designer to break the whole mechanism. Just look how different are the results, albeit how simple is the test piece.

This implies a) that something is broken and b) that you know the language designer's mind. Different results don't equal broken, in this case.

I appreciate, genuinely, the effort you put into the example. Now, let's see if you can take one case, describe how you think the current behavior can be improved, and explain why. Contrast that with explaining how things work, and where things are consistent, if not intuitively clear, versus something that looks better at a glance, but may lead to other problems.

&gt; I've counted 6 differences between R2 and R3, 2 between R2 and Red and 4 between R3 and Red.  
&gt; A conclusion that I came to after this experiment is that contexts weren't designed to be recreated. That's why I like to think of them as of contexts not objects.

Both Rebol3 and Red are alpha, so I wouldn't draw any "conclusion" about anything there until 1.0 is reached (or at least without reminding the reader about the context), as some behaviors might be unfinished design/implementation or simple bugs. That said, I pretty much agree with your conclusion, though things might change in Red until 1.0 (I already have some design ideas I need to work on and validate on paper, before changing anything about objects).

[23:02](#msg5aef899053ceca3604b832e6)The tricky part, and why we don't have standard HOFs in Red yet, is the overall design. We have a number of `map/filter` possibilities, and I'm probably not the only one with other `*-each/all` funcs (e.g. `find-each`, `change-all`). I think the general idea will be to offer both FP style HOFs, which take function args, but \*also* `*-each` style funcs that take `body` blocks, but we don't have a public RFC on the design yet.

To @endo64's question, yes, I think we should and will have this. The `each` operator idea is interesting, but \*really* needs some thought. We also have the `for` REP, which @peterawood has put more thought and suggestions into, and I need to revisit.

[23:14](#msg5aef8c6c6f9af87e04499b0e)@greggirwin there should be list that contain \*how other languages do this* so red contributors can ~~steal~~ borrow/choice from them.

hiiamboris

[08:27](#msg5af00e0e97e5506e04a23e1b)what I'm experimenting on is a bit different though: I want range to have a series as it's inherent property... there's about a dozen of series func that support /part refinement and every func handles that /part logic separately, while this approach can bring it all under a single banner  
... plus get rid of foreach/forskip end checks  
and we'll see where it goes further from that

dockimbel

[09:13](#msg5af0189f97e5506e04a25f88)@hiiamboris You could repurpose `pair!` type for ranges, that's something we were thinking about.

meijeru

[09:44](#msg5af01ff197f07c7e1374b180)That solution works only for integers (and floats in the future), not for any other scalar type. :worried:

hiiamboris

[10:14](#msg5af0270e53ceca3604b9cc75)I can't seemingly find any real use for pairs... I rather see range as a special case of iterator  
If \*iterator* has:  
1\. data it's iterating upon - be it series or ℤ or some abstraction  
2\. position in that data (state)  
3\. end-condition  
4\. a method of transition to it's next position/state

Then \*range* would have 1,2,3 and probably also a method to reset it to it's initial state, but has no (4), and enumerability is implied - for purposes of copying, random access, slicing, you name it

nedzadarek

[10:27](#msg5af02a0440f24c43045b4e51)@greggirwin good to knows. Maybe I'll make a list if you people (I doubt) haven't seen something.  
@hiiamboris I've been thinking about series in the Rebol/Red and you can do different operations. My wish is to mimic blocks (e.g. `arr: [1 2 3] arr2: next arr`). I've posted one in the \[github](https://github.com/nedzadarek/turnaround) (I think I need to change it because I gained some knowledge about the language and I don't like some part of it). I have on my HDD something like \*range* but I'm not sure about its state (it seems to work). I can see \*filter* but I don't think it was in usable state.  
I'm little busy with another project but if you really want to see it I can clean it and post it on the github.

and I guess @dockimbel meant `pair!` (or even `tuple!`) for something like this: `arr: [1 2 3 4 5] range1: arr/2x4; [2 3 4]` (It's very nice idea!)

hiiamboris

[10:44](#msg5af02e1403cafa797b31b388)@nedzadarek there's unlikely an implementation that I want anyway, so I would just like to digest the refined ideas that others might have already come to... ;) working or not doesn't matter much  
As to pair!, it looks to me as just a syntactic sugar for copy/part. Is there any other use?

[10:53](#msg5af0302d6f9af87e044b4e70)Same with 1.10.1 notations.. it's useless. For what? save 3 keystrokes? Who's using the fortran's `for` loop nowadays (ok, it's called `do` there)? It's 61 years old. Even C's `for` is a basically a general purpose iterator in one line, except you can't carry it around.

[10:54](#msg5af0305f5cf0b83004614053)What everyone seems to forget is that `tuple!`s are limited to values below 255.

9214

[11:01](#msg5af0320eb37eab7d0472def0)And IMO `range` should be widely applicable to data/code generation of any kind, not just numeric data and scalars.

[11:02](#msg5af03253db299d4004d99359)@BeardPower While you're dealing with simplest series - no real need. Once you catch yourself repeating the same stuff over and over however, and realize the stuff is not extensible anymore and impossible to reason about - you start looking that way ;)

[11:09](#msg5af033d2f2d2d537046c1746)I'd argue that a dialect akin to Lisp \[`loop` macro](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/loop-for-black-belts.html) would be even better.

pbaille

[11:13](#msg5af034db1eddba3d04dafd95)@9214 i ask because, those days, i'm thinking about something like \[this](https://github.com/clojure/test.check/blob/master/doc/intro.md) for Red. Actually not exactly like this, i would like the generating strategy to be deterministic. therefore potentially leading to many applications (including pattern matching, logic programming... not only tests). does it make sense?

[11:17](#msg5af035b7ff26986d083b4fc3)for exemple: simple types like `integer!` could be viewed as ranges of possible values satisfying the type, where it become more powerfull, is when you can split those ranges, `split 2 integer!` should return 2 ranges, containing the first half of integers and the second half of integers. I let you imagine what one can do with those kind of abilities... it seems powerful to me!

But one problem today is that there's no support for these in the language. All natives/actions will see these generators as just functions (which they are).

9214

[11:52](#msg5af03dea00dc4888049f3682)I'm more into generators as suppressed evaluation that produces results with specific property or pattern. Ranges can be build on top of them.

[11:52](#msg5af03e1940f24c43045b9868)Similar to streams and lazy lists I guess.

pbaille

[11:54](#msg5af03e8f5cf0b830046173c0)yes i see. producing "results with specific property or pattern" is maybe kind of an higher order concern.

nedzadarek

[12:59](#msg5af04dbe6f9af87e044bbd73)@hiiamboris it's not a copy because you would like to propagate changes in the original series... I guess.  
I'm using \*old fashioned loops* where I cannot use modern solutions.  
Vid uses `pair!` as point (x&amp;y coordinates). I'm not sure if other use it in other ways.  
Well, then I'll finish my project and I'll post it.

@9214 `series!` is like iterator - it hold the position in the series. Sure, there is probably more to add but the basic idea (position in the series) is in there already. For the reducers it may be easy to learn.

hiiamboris

[13:02](#msg5af04e7600dc4888049f74b7)&gt; Ranges can be build on top of them.

@9214 a counter-argument: you can copy your range at will, navigate it randomly, treat it as any other series. But how will you copy the generator's output? Call it n times? How would you append to it or modify otherwise?

[20:51](#msg5af0bc40ff26986d083d708c)Doc may have meant tuples, rather than pairs, for ranges. That notation doesn't make sense to me, but I'm also steeped in thinking of them as 2D coordinates.

[20:57](#msg5af0bdae00dc488804a13d41)One of the big issues, then, is writing our own functions that expect certain behavior from all series, which may no longer hold true.

It's a testament to the time Carl spent on the core design, and how carefully Nenad has done things. Honoring and understanding the fundamental tenets is key, in my mind. As soon as you tug on one thing, 4 other things move.

greggirwin

[22:38](#msg5af0d56f97e5506e04a518ee)@gltewalt same reason. Start with the definition of a range. Now think of a literal form, functions, and use cases. What do we gain by having a `range!` type, beyond doing it with mezzanines? i.e., how would we do it today, and see if there's a demonstrably better way to do it.

As always, and since this is a main room with a lot of newer people in it, I'll say again that the burden is never on Red (and its designer) to justify why \*not* to include or support something, but on \*us* to show why it \*should\*.

[22:44](#msg5af0d6e097e5506e04a51df1)There's even an old wiki page on `range` we can add notes to: https://github.com/red/red/wiki/Ranges

Mezzanine should be enough unless we start talking lazy sequences?

We use ranges of elements all the time with bitset, so with parse there looks to be both iterator and range. `charset [#”a” - #”z”]`

[08:25](#msg5af401ebbd10f34a68ef4791)A question on design: selection by index in series! and bitset! values works both for getting and setting, and is allowed in the form of path notation (`v/1`) and by `pick` and `poke`. For other composite values (types time! date! pair! and tuple!) getting and setting by indexing is allowed, and `pick` but NOT `poke`. In REBOL `poke` is allowed. Curiously, `poke` has been programmed for tuples, but is not registered in the action table. @dockimbel can you remember the rationale? See also my comment to #3379.

[09:31](#msg5af4118ab84be71db9f70357)Precision: REBOL allows `poke` on date! time! and tuple!, but not on pair!

[09:33](#msg5af411d0862c5e33e92393d1)And R3 does not allow it on any of these.

dockimbel

[09:46](#msg5af414f2a2d95136332bb600)@meijeru It was left in that state for a later decision on supporting (or not) `pick/poke` for those types. As paths are just syntactic shortcuts to core actions/natives, they need to have a "regular" counterpart. If `pick/poke` are the only option, I think they should be supported.

Oldes

[09:55](#msg5af416f85a1d895fae2c03e1)@dockimbel in R3, `exists?` function was returning type or none value, in Rebol and Red it is true/false. Will you keep it?

meijeru

[10:13](#msg5af41b5c5666c42eb6fdc89d)The type returned by R3 is the type of the argument, supposedly. Therefore it adds no information. R2 returns true/false as well.

Oldes

[10:16](#msg5af41c0f1cfca775e1fa2def)In R3 it was returning `directory` and `file`, so there was some value, but I also think it was not required... one can use `query` to have this information.

meijeru

[17:21](#msg5af47fa7a2d95136332d64ee)@dockimbel Coming back to poke on direct values, there is an interesting discussion in the R3 issues (ex Curecode),

Oldes

[19:26](#msg5af49ceabd10f34a68f1ae0c)I inclined to `exists?` returning logic, but on the other side.. as `dir?` is not checking real existence in Rebol, I see that `exists?` returning type may be useful.

[09:29](#msg5b0928fba7abc8692ee68033)Can anyone inside the core team give a half-realistic guess on when we might get 0.7? IMO 0.7 ought to be called 1.0 and just get the damn thing out the door once the bugs are cleaned up. We're coming on 1 year since I began looking for work on 0.7 to begin and, from all I can tell, there has been NO real progress at all since then on making Red itself more usable. The silence is deafening. I echo the first comment made on this thread: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14793517

9214

[09:58](#msg5b092fc652e35117cde237e7)@tanstaaf1 and what's the point of giving half-realistic guesses, besides setting up your expectations?

ICO fundraising took the lion's share of team's time and resources, and now they slowly but steadily proceed on all fronts. Silence? Main repo is full of everyday PRs and bugfixes and Gitter is fairly active. No real progress, really? How about Android sneak-peek, new console engine, successful fundraising, networking with Google, to name a few? Priorities have shifted from 'usability' to 'sustainability', and now, after things worked out as they were planned, 0.7.0 will come sooner, and I expect more extra goodies in the package. Stay tuned and be patient, or, if you need I/O right here right now - jump the ship to any other programming language past the alpha stage. No one owes you anything.

dockimbel

[11:19](#msg5b0942af93dc78791c88d241)@tanstaaf1 Hurrying up to a 1.0 without funding and business strategy would have been a dead-end. Fortunately we didn't do that, otherwise the project would have been closing shortly after going 1.0. With the path we took, we have now not only secured the funds for a 1.0 and a 2.0, but also have opened the opportunity to go mainstream.

tanstaaf1

[13:31](#msg5b0961b4361a950a6618f724)@dockimbel @9214 I'm asking a question, as someone who is concerned and has either invested -- or wasted, depending of whether 1.0 reaches fruitition -- some hundreds of hours following the progress and playing with the language. I included the link since that is what I found when I typed in "red 1.0" into my search engine and it does, I think, fairly sum up a lot of the concern/skepticism in the development community. And I think the concern/skepticism is reasonable as few languages make it past alpha stage and, arguably, rebol itself didn't actually succeed in reaching orbit (although it certainly did engender a lot of enthusiasm invested effort). I also understood the need to retrench and get new funding ... Nenad et al need to eat and live in order to keep coding, after all. As someone who deals with timelines all the time in my various businesses, it is a reasonable question to ask: is there a new target deadline for 0.7? As the quoted thread author sums up, the gui -- brilliant and essential as it is -- is a quagmire. It could consume another 20 years of work ... but it ought to be called "good enough" and left as a project to perfect after all the core features are in place. I've never been anything but a friend and advocate of the project...please keep that in mind.

[13:50](#msg5b09660a160c567d16dc7222)Having a staged timeline, treating it very seriously, and pushing + triaging to meet it (rather than holding back on committal and forever regrouping) is an \*essential* step in RAD and Lean production and, really, serious manifesting of all kinds. Patton: "A good plan, violently executed today, is far better than a perfect plan next week." is only one -- of thousands -- of applicable aphorisms from those who have dared, and accomplished greatly. Another is "Work expands to fill the time available"; making time UNavailable is one secret of getting essential things done.

9214

[14:04](#msg5b09697d352b9e1a4b34e3e7)Sounds like "rush towards 1.0 without thinking and planning in advance because I need ports ASAP" to me.

greggirwin

[15:04](#msg5b09779652e35117cde3009b)@tanstaaf1 we understand very well that people want estimates and updates, and we do the best we can in that regard. Since you've been around a while, you know that we adjust priorities to focus on what is needed to move the project forward. That won't always align with the features general users need (and they need different subsets based on their use of Red).

Having a staged timeline is great, but we also need to adapt it as things change, and things have changed a \*lot\*. We can discuss the applicability of Patton's aphorisms, Sun Tzu's advice, Agile, Lean, RAD, Just-in-Time, etc. but I could just as easily come back with "Slow but steady wins the race", "Fools rush in" and more, yes? There's no formula we can apply directly to Red, is there?

If you have suggestions about what else we could add to https://github.com/red/red/wiki/Red-Project-Approach, they are welcome. Maybe something about how we choose to make announcements and roadmap updates. e.g., "we make them when they're ready."

All that said, if you revisit your initial message about this, putting yourself in our shoes, can you see how some things could be seen as confrontational to us? I think that's where you got some push-back from @9214. Here comes my stern face. Asking for a "half-realistic guess" implies things about us. Saying there has been "NO real progress" on Red in the past year, and that "the silence is deafening", when we are here most every day, and so much work has been done, raised \*my* hackles a bit.

I think your other messages and suggestions are borne of frustration, and a genuine desire to help and for Red to succeed. You're experienced enough to know it really doesn't work that way though.

[17:25](#msg5b09987b54ce231361587d13)@greggirwin I'm not complaining as a complainer; I apologize if anyone took my comments in that fashion.

greggirwin

[17:36](#msg5b099b1e16f6496124e20c9f)We all get worked up. Text, email, and chat are easy to misunderstand at times. Deep breathing helps. :^)

It's interesting to me, being a frugal person by nature, that when startups get VC, the VCs want them to spend the money as fast as possible, to grow and cash out. We have to find the balance of spending where there's value, capitalize on being an early mover in blockchain tech, support those who took part in the ICO, but also know that we are not looking to cash out. We're much more old school, and want to build something that lasts, so we can use Red long term.

[17:39](#msg5b099bb84eaffb692d59f165)Also, because the ETH raised is not the same as cash, and the future is uncertain, we have to plan for that volatility.

tanstaaf1

[18:07](#msg5b09a262016ae21a4ce79f00)@greggirwin I followed the link but don't see a forum for discussing timeline, triage, etc? Am I correct that the only substantial area where Red is not yet at least as good as Rebol2 is I/O? If so, then as I have previously expressed, once I/O is implemented, and the core is stabilized/debugged, Red could supplant Rebol pretty much entirely and unite the community? God knows the existing GUI for Red is way beyond Rebol2. If my presuppositions are fundamentally correct then published books could follow and businesses could begin to put the core + existing GUI to serious use as a "stable" base? The lack of that foundation is the main reason I've not yet tried to incorporate it in my own business processes.

greggirwin

[18:12](#msg5b09a393ba1a351a68c776ac)Red doesn't have GC or ports yet, which are the other big things.

[18:14](#msg5b09a3e94eaffb692d5a0bcd)Part of the reason we publish things when they are done, rather than before, is because PR takes a lot of time itself. Announcements of upcoming features can lead to a lot of discussion and take even more time. It's a balancing act.

tanstaaf1

[18:20](#msg5b09a57ab6eece791db5f879)@greggirwin We are in a world-wide economic bubble. ZIRP distorts/suspends normal financial metrics, which are long-term based on discounting EXISTING cash flows. Few businesses or governments cash flow very well in the current world. When the current mania ends there will be a brick wall to be faced. It would be nice if Red 1.0 was out by then and it was in rapidly growing use as a reliable, ready-for-real work language.

greggirwin

[18:22](#msg5b09a5c9a7abc8692ee7c615)We also have to stay optimistic, or we'd just quit. :^) We're also clear in telling people that Red is Alpha. People can, and we want them to, experiment with Red, but even we can't see the future. Could we have foreseen this blockchain aspect a year ago? I don't think so. And while some things may seem isolated, or "not too hard", they often have design ramifications. e.g., do we just do sync I/O and add async later? Or do we think about how the whole async model should work for I/O, ports, and events? How do those all relate to concurrency, and the design for that? What about modules and how they're loaded? And the basic GC will likely need to be swapped out when all those are done, but maybe the basic model is still good, and smaller; more appropriate for some systems. Do we offer a GC option? The ripple effect is huge, and everything we put out, which changes, later, affects more users.

tanstaaf1

[18:24](#msg5b09a65a4eaffb692d5a1291)You should stay optimistic. Red IS something spectacular yet well-based on reality. I want to see it safely though the pre-1.0 danger. I have NO doubt about it's long term acceptance once it is solid enough for real work and published books documenting how to use it.

greggirwin

[18:25](#msg5b09a6a4b6eece791db5facc)I agree about the bubble, but the arbitrary 1.0 moniker doesn't really matter. Version numbers really don't matter at all. Rebol2 is a solid, stable, wonderful, amazing language. I've done real work with it since 2001. It still didn't succeed \*enough\*. We need to get Red to the point where we can survive long term. Everything else is gravy. That's why we focus on what \*we* need.

[18:27](#msg5b09a709c5750d377c157c6f)Being the new JS would be great and terrible. But LiveCode, Delphi, K, and others are equally valid success models.

[18:31](#msg5b09a815c5750d377c158036)Well, sometimes it seems to me, that a bit of a luck is needed too. There would be no Ruby popularity, if there were no Rails.

tanstaaf1

[18:32](#msg5b09a826ba1a351a68c78287)@greggirwin You would know better than I, and @dockimbel better than either of us. But I see no fundamental reason why any of those longer-term (and wonderful) advances HAVE to break the existing core (I take it as given that the work to date has been well factored in that regard). Therefore they can be implemented or perfected later, without breaking changes. I think the GUI work WAS vital, as that is where Red's amazing uniqueness really gets demoed for most people. That's the strategy I would pursue if FST was my company; that's what I am mostly trying to encourage. Again, though, there may be bottlenecks to that I really am ignorant of. which really cannot be worked around.

[18:33](#msg5b09a86e361a950a6619c521)Ruby is ok but Red is mind-blowing...revolutionary in a positive and practical sense.

tanstaaf1

[18:40](#msg5b09aa00c712f56125352b74)@greggirwin I look around -- look at Julia for example -- and the 1.0 label DOES matter. If you follow the forums it is clear most people are holding back, or forced to hold back by their employers, so they don't get stuck with breaking changes or a going-nowhere language. Kotlin is another great example. 1.0 was critical. 1.0 was critical for Swift as well. And Rust. 1.0 won't turn a nag into a winning race-horse, but 1.0 does -- and should -- mean something. Especially to business owners.

[18:52](#msg5b09acd9016ae21a4ce7babb)What I value in @tanstaaf1 words, is his openess. Being a long time community member, I was often faced with situations, where ppl turned into contacting me privately, to encourage me not fearing to speak in public. During those Red years, I can see ppl contextually expressing the will to have - core first. I can understand it. But constant push also can make Red team stressed. They wish for a success as anybody else here. Redbol is also different in some other aspects - only a hanful of ppl can contribute to core. Look at Kaj's work. He did many things ahead, but his work would not be accepted in core anyway. So, most of the community has just to wait ... or help in other areas ...

[18:56](#msg5b09ade5edd06f7d15e6eb5d)Carl once asked me, why ppl did not start to use R3 already, and hence I created an article - what makes a good beta. Simply put, we need good console experience, which is coming, GC for sure, which is coming too, and then -connectivity to not stay isolated. So IO with various protocols, db connectivity, xml and web services would be a plus.

[18:58](#msg5b09ae53352b9e1a4b35a165)In fact, I don't understand, what was Carl's question about. R3 had richer GUI, better parse, various core language improvements, but lacked on some important stuff R2 already had.

greggirwin

[21:40](#msg5b09d467a7abc8692ee83d68)@tanstaaf1 my point is that it has to \*be* a 1.0, not just marked as such. And only Nenad has the right to decide what needs to be there for that, which I think has been laid out in the roadmaps of the past. New roadmaps are coming, but aren't a top priority.

tanstaaf1

[04:00](#msg5b0a2d5bc712f56125364b87)@greggirwin Yes, it needs to \*be* a 1.0. I also agree it is Nenad's to call; how could it be otherwise? That said, What does it mean to \*"be a 1.0"\*? And to what extent is Nenad being pressured to add in all the things he has sort of said would be coming – but were not part of his original vision? Nenad is obviously a little bit of a perfectionist – which is good to a point, but after all these years is probably putting both Nenad's health and Red's safety at risk. Until a “good enough for business use” 1.0 is released and documented enough for widespread adoption to begin, everything is at risk. For what?

What version is C++ on now? Why didn't they just wait until now to release C++ 1.0 and Java 1.0? How did that prolonged wait for Perl 6.0 work out?

Can we maybe agree that there is an essential core a language needs to define its essence...its integrity, make it usable and “complete enough” for business deployment, and insulate it against breaking changes in the future? Once that integrity exists there is still the thorough debugging against edge cases and the documentation project – and these latter two aspects can take literally years to complete on their own. What really stands between where Red is now and being 1.0 enough to completely supplant Rebol and unite the community and begin the deployment into businesses?

[04:07](#msg5b0a2f13c712f56125364f55)Numbering beyond 1.0 is somewhat abitrary; 1.0 doesn't have to be, IMO. GC and multitasking and support for Linux GUI could be 1.X And then 2.0 could be all the things Nenad dreams of such as JIT. Or maybe that could be 3.0. Knowing how to chunk and how to discern essentials for things which would be nice to have is all part of the creation and business success.

[06:33](#msg5b0a513216f6496124e39f6b)A 1.0 is indeed necessary but far from sufficent. I strongly disagree with the idea that there would be a difference in risk before and after a 1.0. Putting a 1.0 out, doing some advertisment and expecting people would just come is a recipe for failure. Best technologies in software industry (and other) don't necessarily succeed, we have plenty of examples for that. Success requires much more than that. Moreover, nowhere in your proposition to go 1.0 at all costs and while dropping everything else, I do see a solid proposal for funding the work, especially post 1.0. What amazing business strategy in your "1.0 asap at all costs" do you propose to succeed where RebolTech failed?

[06:39](#msg5b0a52a499fa7f4c06210a33)There is probably a lot of Red users who would disagree with that.

[06:46](#msg5b0a5441361a950a661b4231)Also, if you think that the features-list for 1.0 has anything to do with my personal preferences and wishes, that's wrong. The decisions are driven by our strategy for success, and trying to fit the users and market needs. If it was just about me, GUI support would have gone in a 1.x version, I would have focused on a minimal /Core version only. Though such direction could not have led to funding, nor any sustainable business (cf. RebolTech).

[06:49](#msg5b0a54f0361a950a661b4384)For the people who were in the Rebol community, it should be clear since a long time that a purely technical roadmap is not a way to build a sustainable and long-lived product.

[06:54](#msg5b0a5640a7abc8692ee953f9)I try to learn from the past, and no do the same mistakes other did. If you look at the point where Red started and was first announced in 2011, and where we are now, with the all the progress we have made, and the several successful fundings and business opportunities that are opening for us, you should see that we are on the right track. I know that from the pure user perspective, it's not yet fully satisfying, but was it satisfying to wait 6 years for R3 and then see the project closed? Red would have had most probably the same fate, if I had just aimed at a 1.0 without considering the long-term sustainability of the project.

&gt; There is probably a lot of Red users who would disagree with that.

Even with no I/O one can plug in an external library and get things going. But no GC means: no servers, no data processing, no resident GUI apps, no mobile apps. I'd merge GC at 0.6.4 or 0.6.5 tops.

meijeru

[10:16](#msg5b0a857854ce2313615aa0b7)Whether intentional or not, it makes sense to me. In any case, in R2, `to binary!` does a `to string!` first, e.g. `to binary! 0` =&gt; `#{30}`. Red does not do that, so the differences extend beyond `none`.

endo64

[10:40](#msg5b0a8b2254ce2313615aac9f)I agree that `to binary! 0 => #{30}` is useless. But `make string!`, `make binary!`, `make integer!` with `none` could be useful in some cases.  
Here is the other differences:

```
make integer! none ; == 0 (R2)
make integer! "" ; == 0 (R2)
make block! none ; == [] (R2)
; error on Red for all
```

On Red, `make` generally doesn't accept `none`. I think this can be added to https://github.com/red/red/wiki/Differences-between-Red-and-Rebol

[00:05](#msg5b0b47b6160c567d16e11c52)@endo64 @meijeru, it is by design (just looking at strings right now). Should `make string! none` treat `none` as `0` or as `'none`? For comparison, `logic!` values return their formed representation.

[00:45](#msg5b0b5128a7abc8692eebca86)&gt; Can we maybe agree that there is an essential core a language needs to define its essence...its integrity, make it usable and “complete enough” for business deployment...  
&gt; Knowing how to chunk and how to discern essentials for things which would be nice to have is all part of the creation and business success.

@tanstaaf1, we can absolutely agree on the essential core part, which is \*exactly* what Nenad has done.

Defining "complete enough for business deployment" is a bit trickier. Maybe I should say "impossible without clearer requirements." Whose business are we talking about? For some people, that means big DB/SQL access. For others it means Apple iOS support. There are languages out there being used for real world projects that don't have all the features Red has today, right now \*and historically\*, aren't there?

If we ask: "What \*can't* you do with Red today?", what's the answer?

Will it do more in the future? Yes. Will some things get even easier? Yes. Are some features more important than others? Yes. If they're listed on the roadmap, we probably already consider them important.

Open Source Options:  
1\) Be patient, and be happy with what you get  
2\) Make It So yourself

5\) Be dissatisfied

I agree - you can put anything in it.

Yes, but I would like to see it in a form of syntactic sugar. For example: (`t: t/bar; "baz"` `t/foo; true`).

So Red's current behavior looks ok for issue! values at least.

greggirwin

[00:47](#msg5b0f460c4eaffb692d6bdfbb)Thanks. I may not be avoidable, but it could create the window behind the scenes, and destroy it for you. Maybe we just provide a wrapper for that though. The reason is that Red uses native controls, not just drawing into its own buffers to render.

[00:47](#msg5b0f463b99fa7f4c0631732c)I checked, and it is by design that it bails if there's no hwnd for the face when using `to image!`.

Respectech

[00:49](#msg5b0f4689a7abc8692ef98eb7)That makes sense, but limits the usability for server-side image creation.

greggirwin

[00:49](#msg5b0f46b3e26c847ac8a4d5d9)How so? You need the same OS running that you want to show it for, right? So just create and destroy (`unview`) the window.

[00:51](#msg5b0f4711a45f930a65eaf1da)In my example, I'm running on a headless Ubuntu OS running on an ARM device. If X is not running, then I don't believe GTK+ could run either, so I can't create a window, right?

greggirwin

[00:52](#msg5b0f474d93dc78791c9b6e07)Correct. So you can't create GUI screenshots on a server with no GUI support...without a little creativity.

[00:52](#msg5b0f4768016ae21a4cf92d8a)Are there \*any* systems out there that would let you do that?

Respectech

[00:53](#msg5b0f477e352b9e1a4b475785)I understand that R2/R3 used it's own graphic subsystem for 'view, which is probably why this was possible on R2/R3.

Respectech

[00:55](#msg5b0f4814ba1a351a68d94c9e)There are a lot of tools on Linux that let someone do this, like phantomjs, wkhtmltoimage, and others

[00:57](#msg5b0f488a52e35117cdf52c9a)phantomjs makes use of Python and JS, obviously.

BeardPower

[01:09](#msg5b0f4b4eedd06f7d15f8b4f1)@greggirwin Yes. You can just render into an off-screen buffer with OpenGL or any other drawing API.

Respectech

PeterWAWood

[01:41](#msg5b0f52cf93dc78791c9b885a)@Respectech Red does run on ARM natively but needs to be cross-compiled on a machine with Rebol2 (or the encapped Red binary).

We tried compiling on ARM using the Rebol2 ARM compiler but it was too buggy.

There is currently a bug in Red that is causing cross-compiled programs to fail. See #3352. I'm expecting this to get fixed before the next release.

[01:30](#msg5b10a1a5ba1a351a68dde72a)Good morning :) Has anyone come across the situation where a parse will quickly return true, but an otherwise equivalent parse-trace hangs and doesn't seem to complete ?

[01:31](#msg5b10a1d6352b9e1a4b4bf0df)this even happens with my own implementation of the callback function which just prints something, if I do a parse/trace

[22:36](#msg5b146d8699fa7f4c0640f505)@meijeru perhaps, I've also been thinking about something even more high level. But I don't know if/when I'll be able to work on it and develop the ideas.

[22:41](#msg5b146e87c712f56125569b1b)I think that in general Red's goal is to be much closer to R2 than Topaz was meant to be, and be more traditional in the way control is still completely in the hands of the programmer (this is especially important to be able to write efficient code).

I suspect that the best approach might be to write something \*on top* of Red, perhaps as a compilable dialect.

[19:39](#msg5b16e6e2a45f930a65037d87)I've made it simpler to use my scripts. Instead of having them in certain hardcoded path, you can now include them with two following lines:

```
do http://rebolek.com/redquire
redquire 'json ; or block! of more scripts
```

All my scripts will be updated to use this method soon. `redquire` handles downloading scripts from web and using them from local path when possible. It's tested on Linux and may need one change for Windows, as it depends on `HOME` environment variable, that may or may not exist on Windows (I don't know).

[12:08](#msg5b1920404eaffb692d8ba89c)I'm trying to dive into Red PARSE dialect. Objective is to implement a grammar checker. The grammar rules of sentences, should be a Red parse expression instead of a messy regular-expression. Parse expressions are NEAT.

I can't seem to find anything beyond - https://www.red-lang.org/2013/11/041-introducing-parse.html

[12:12](#msg5b1a72bba09ae108e60c2053)Announcement: inspired by earlier work for Rebol I have created a program to show the application of `to-string form mold` and `mold/all` to values of all Red types. See my \[Gist](https://gist.github.com/meijeru/6f4d37547a2ec16b9502812eb11c2dcd). This may help in straightening out the design of those four functions which convert a value into a string, each in their own way. My own observations follow in a later post.

[12:14](#msg5b1a7341659aad4a325e40ca)Notes on to-string etc.:  
\* `mold/all` is not yet implemented (currently `== mold`)  
\* `to-string` refuses values of types `unset!` and `none!`  
\* `form none` is the empty string  
\* all four functions give equal results for `logic! number! word! any-path! bitset! typeset! pair! tuple! date! time! url! email!` and `image!`  
\* `to-string == form` for all but `any-list!` and `binary!`  
\* `to-string` and `form` omit the "decoration" for `any-word!` values , but not for `any-path!` values  
\* `to-string` and `form` omit the "decoration" also for `datatype! char! string! file! tag!`  
\* `to-string` and `form` for `vector!` values have spaces, unlike for `any-list!` values

NB `any-list!` = `make typeset! [block! paren! hash!]`

svnpenn

[14:41](#msg5b1be72bffd8896fe916d660)@9214 the Red Library takes a while to build compared to the program itself - this is solved normally by using `-c` - which creates the Red Shared Library is not exist - and will link to it if it does - however this does not work for those who wish to have a final static build - that is to say a single EXE - Red should have an option to create the Red Static Library (`libRedRT.a` or similar) if it does not exist - then link to it statically if it does - i am surprised that this is not an option given that you CAN create a static build using `-r` - but that option is almost not worth using as it recompiles the Red Library every single time - pointlessly IMO

[14:55](#msg5b1bea5b4b2d9417e1d77833)@svnpenn In a nutshell, while you are developping your app, you can use `-c` to get fast compilation times. When it's time to release it you can use `-r` for building a standalone executable. Moreover, compilation is totally optional (unless you have R/S code embedded), so you can simply run your Red app from the console or using the interpreter from command-line.

svnpenn

[15:13](#msg5b1bee99106f3c24bde99a40)@dockimbel i suppose you are right - but i would just prefer to use static the entire way - it seems odd to me that i would use a DLL while developing - then use Static when releasing - countless other projects offer Static Libraries - that you can use \*\*when developing\** - so Red seems to be the outlier here

9214

[15:18](#msg5b1befb5e36e0e7d3f60ec4e)@svnpenn I'd say that if you came here just to compare how Red is different from other projects, then you've started with a wrong point :wink: Personally I don't see any advantage of static library over dynamic one in this particular case.

Again, why you ever need to compile your script during development?

dockimbel

[15:20](#msg5b1bf02a6023754a317dc750)@svnpenn As I mentioned above, if you are not embedding R/S code in your Red app, you \*\*don't need to compile during development\** at all.

svnpenn

[15:21](#msg5b1bf08d4b2d9417e1d78b1d)@9214 the current workflow requires libRed to be compiled twice - first the DLL is compiled during the development process - then libRed is compiled again during the release process - ideally a Static libRed would be compiled during development process and simply linked during the release process

svnpenn

[15:24](#msg5b1bf139ddd61d08e5419b80)@9214 what about http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous\_integration - with Red - you have to rebuild libRed every time you use `-r`

[16:33](#msg5b1c01673516592752f7860f)@loziniak It's not a quirk, `switch` is basically just a smart sugar for `do select`.

[16:36](#msg5b1c0213e36e0e7d3f61276d)@loziniak `type? 12.3` returns a value `float!` of type `datatype!`, while the first value in your block, namely `float!`, is of a type `word!`. Two `float!`s share the same look, but have different datatypes. It's not that much of a quirk, just requires some general awareness of the evaluation model.

[16:38](#msg5b1c02826077c67d3edeb615)In turn, `type?/word` is a syntactic sugar for:

```

>> do select [float! [print "float"]] to word! type? 12.4

[16:49](#msg5b1c05380b75bc7d5af7a487)@meijeru I think `mold/all` should serialize all words properly, not just `true`, `none` and others. I also corrected a couple of typos here and there.

meijeru

[16:53](#msg5b1c05ee0b75bc7d5af7a69c)@9214 Thanks for the improvements. On `mold/all` I fully agree. In Rebol (3?) `mold/all` was able to serialize series with their pointer beyond the start, e.g.  
`b: next [1 2 3] mold/all b` =&gt; `{#[block! [1 2 3] 2]}`  
But since `mold/all` is not yet implemented, we must assume that this is also what the Red team wants. Right, @dockimbel?

dockimbel

[18:27](#msg5b1c1bfda09ae108e61115aa)@meijeru For now, that's a correct assumption.

[22:48](#msg5b1c593e0b75bc7d5af888c9)Just a comment on the previous discussion about not needing to compile during development phase - I've certainly found it useful to compile regularly during development, because I have come across situations where code will run via interpreter, but not compile.

And is there a reason it's not mandatory to prefix hex literals with a digit? Like `0ACh`? Won't it cause collisions with the words namespace?

[20:32](#msg5b2eae4c479ca2668979d76f)The current hex format is a tradeoff, to be sure. We don't want to do it like other langs, as that's not a good fit for Red. Many alternatives have been considered, but no clear winner emerged. It's not likely to cause conflict, unless you call something `FACEh` or tombstone values as `DEADh`, but people will surely complain about case sensitivity inconsistency.

It's a pragmatic tradeoff, but should be considered in cases where code generation or untrusted data are in use. Once we're in RedLand (not too close a neighbor to Redmond), type checking is your friend.

The problem is that `tre` is set to word, but you need the object referred to by word, which you get by `get`.

Alternatively:

```
foreach tre [twix xocolate][print (tre)/candy]
```

[19:36](#msg5b368a43479ca266898b1d9d)Yet another possibility - to evaluate words before `tre` is set:

[03:29](#msg5b36f91ff1664406610d7e05)@JaumeGreen Sorry, I was mistaken :flushed: The second one above is misleading. Although it prints `twix` and `xocolate`, these are not values from the object but words referred to by `tre`. You can see it if you change the data in objects, e.g.:

```
xocolate/candy: "chocolate"
>> foreach tre treat-list [print (tre)/candy]
twix
xocolate
== /candy
```

Nothing changed in output. Besides `/candy` is returned after printing. Which means `print (tre)` is evalueated separately and then `/candy` is returned as the last evaluated item. You can also see it here:

```
>> foreach tre treat-list [tre: get tre print (tre)/candy]
candy: "twix"
candy: "chocolate"
== /candy
```

https://gist.github.com/giesse/1232d7f71a15a3a8417ec6f091398811

Obviously I prefer mine, but please let me know what you think. My code will compute a suitable `count` to run the code in order to get a reasonably accurate result, so you don't have to guess which value to pass to `/count` or adjust it depending on which machine you are running on.

The backward compatible version will default to this mode, but still allow you to pass a `/count` value, and it will return a block in the same format as the original (even though `time!` is not accurate enough for "fast" code). My version doesn't have a `/count` refinement, and returns results in a slightly different format, using `float!` instead of `time!`.

[18:37](#msg5b3d13dae534eb69a5c843bd)@hiiamboris is that to automatically profile each function call etc? I wrote something similar for REBOL a long time ago, but ultimately it wasn't worth all the pain. I think that kind of stuff needs to be built into the interpreter. (In fact, I would approach the problem differently than most languages, by having a built in trace mode, that dumps execution traces to a big file, then your debugger can parse that and allow you to step forward and backward in time to quickly find bugs - no need for breakpoints and all that -, as well as show statistics like bottlenecks for performance, memory usage, and so on.)

hiiamboris

[18:49](#msg5b3d16a43c5abf52b63c2570)@giesse well, it's pretty simple piece of code and to me it was definitely worth the pain ;) The key point it does not profile \*each* function call but allows the developer hook it to any set of functions he likes (after all it's pretty easy to guess which parts will take most of the time). Of course it makes sense to choose relatively heavy functions and then armed with the results start optimizing them (:  
You can just clone my https://github.com/hiiamboris/red-pure-fun repo and run `pure-fun-test.red` to see the output, I think it's best to see with your own eyes than to argue about ;)  
The use case is when the code has side effects and/or is not trivially decomposable into a linear set of primitives, and/or it's execution time is highly context dependent. Then you simply can't profile with loop/count approach.

[19:56](#msg5b3d26709b82c6701ba2bd75)are there any things you'd want people to report on ? We see its not stable when used from the console, but maybe there are places we can help for testing?

giesse

[21:15](#msg5b3d38ef7b811a6d63d01f45)@hiiamboris - as I said... I did the same thing in REBOL... and used it to optimize a fairly large code base, but it was causing more problems than it was solving. in the end just manually adding profiling hooks in the code was much easier. YMMV.

In any case this is orthogonal to the benchmark function, since you're not running a piece of code n times to measure what it takes, but rather sampling time during the execution of a program. so there's really no common code other than the name `profile` being shared by both (I'm not sure it's the right name for the code I posted, I just used what @greggirwin used. :)

## Thursday 5th July, 2018

greggirwin

[01:24](#msg5b3d733b7b811a6d63d07dc9)@hiiamboris, I'll have to check out your profiling code in more depth. I've used this approach, which is different:

```
time-marks: object [
	data: #()

	;set 'get-time-mark   func [key] [data/:key]
	set 'set-time-mark   func [key] [data/:key: now/precise]
	set 'clear-time-mark func [key] [data/:key: none]
	
	set 'time-since-mark func [key] [
		if none? data/:key [
			print ["##ERROR time-since-mark called for unknown key:" key]
			return none
		]
		difference now/precise data/:key
	]
]
```

Good design space to think about. What do we need to measure, and how to make it easy to do so, including processing the results automatically (logging and analysis).

moliad

[01:27](#msg5b3d7414e534eb69a5c903e8)I've replaced `FUNC` with an alternate profiling version. it keeps statistics of each call and you can call a display of all stats so far. using a global list of functions you want to profile (and a matching, dangling function name as the function body's first element), it will only alter those functions it builds with debugging.

[01:28](#msg5b3d74483572e970c176e276)the advantage is that this is completely invisible to the application, and allows you add profiling, with absolutely no source code polution.

[01:29](#msg5b3d74643572e970c176e28d)just load an extra debug library at the start of you app. :-)

greggirwin

[01:30](#msg5b3d749ff1664406611a6e09)As @giesse said, we can think differently. Having the hooks in place, and figuring out the minimal set of them, is the key. I like the DTrace approach which, again, requires integration from the core. But we can also build at the mezz level (as @moliad says).

[01:31](#msg5b3d74e3a99e1e52b716fb0c)Stepping back from instrumenting functions, to apps, to systems is also important.

[01:33](#msg5b3d7583bd92d807829484d5)e.g., my `time-marks` code above is kind of like `goto`. Wildly general and leaves the details up to you.

giesse

[03:17](#msg5b3d8daf7b811a6d63d0a8d7)Again... been there... done that... https://sourceforge.net/p/rebol-power-mez/code/ci/default/tree/mezz/profiling.rlp

There are a ton of problems. What about `throw` and `catch`? Do you handle `return` and `exit` in a general way? What about errors? If your "call stack" gets out of sync with the actual call stack you end up with bogus results. If you are dealing with a real program, the complexity of getting this to work automatically \*all the time* is not worth it compared to just adding markers where you need them. In the case of Red, the effort would be better spent adding a profiler to the interpreter itself (I wish I had this luxury with REBOL!).

moliad

[03:23](#msg5b3d8f4281816669a4317e3f)@giesse agreed, but this is why I'm porting to Red, so I can tackle many of those issues from within the engine.

[03:27](#msg5b3d902cbd92d8078294afa1)we are currently analysing the implementation of a general case `PARSE` machine debugger, using a visual interface to track, step and interactively manipulate extremely complex parse rules within Red. (our Rebol2 codebase uses hundreds of thousands of rules merged into a single parse call, and we need to be sure we can track this in red, as part of the porting to red process)

[03:28](#msg5b3d907381816669a431812b)The internals of Red already have some (or all?) of the hooks to do it, so my team should be able to get a simple case operational relatively quickly.

hiiamboris

[06:09](#msg5b3db60ca99e1e52b7176b36)@greggirwin I'll help you there  
Firstly, to me it was important that it's easy to plug/unplug the profiler from any function, and that especially makes sense when you the function isn't linear and has more than one return point, so there comes a function wrapper  
At some point I decided I need to count the number of calls to know the single execution time, so it's there  
Then add to that a few facts:  
\- map lookups are a few times slower than object lookups  
\- I didn't do baseline so I placed the `now/precise` part as close as possible to the actual code  
\- my functions called themselves recursively, interleaving one another  
and you'll come to about the same code

I'd add baseline and `exit` support, and an ability to enable/disable all profiling altogether, but as @giesse points out generalizing that onto an \*arbitrary* code base on a mezz level is a lost cause, since we don't have facilities for that. But same can be said about loop/delta-time - profiled functions shouldn't `throw` or `cause-error`

giesse

[17:32](#msg5b3e562c89db5e701ca4b18c)@hiiamboris indeed, however the use case for `delta-time` etc. is to play at the REPL to find if approach 1 is better than approach 2 at solving a given problem, so it doesn't need to be as generic; I want to use it for performance regression testing, where again you control the code of the test so you can work around any of that.

But again... maybe I'll just give a go at my "deep trace" idea one day and solve all the problems. :)

You might want to think about using pre-processor `#def`s for giving aliases to longer names:

[16:57](#msg5b4b7cfdc02eb83d7c77f28e)Hi all. I just started using Red, although I played with REBOL some in the early 00's. I downloaded red-063 to my mac, gave it permissions, and ran ./red-063. At the &gt;&gt; prompt, I typed &gt;&gt;call "touch temp". A file called temp was created in my red directory (the directory with red-063). The result == 7956 was shown in the console. All well and good. I typed &gt;&gt;call "ls - l", and the result ==7905 was shown in the console. And nothing else. My question is, does red have access to stdout? Or do I need to (create a temp file, redirect to the file, poll the file, read the file, delete the file)? Perhaps more importantly, is there perhaps a better place to ask really specific Red questions like this one? Thanks. I'm having lots of fun with Red. -- Stan

cryptowyrm

[12:24](#msg5b4ddfe61539a7040ce48530)Since Red is so easy and quick to compile yourself from the latest code on Github, do the releases really matter that much? At that point, releases are just marketing opportunities and for those you want to show off something cool each time. The last release of the Elm language for example was 1 year and 9 months ago. They don't even talk about the release publicly or on their mailing list, just on their lesser used dev mailing list where they ask in bold letters every time they post that nobody should even talk about specific features of the next release on Twitter &amp; co, so that the impact of the new features is bigger once it's released and announced on Hacker News &amp; co. Hyper focused on marketing to spread the language as far and wide as they can. No idea if that's the right thing to do, but there are hundreds of programming languages now so if you want your language to get any traction you might need to use little marketing tricks like that. The flip side is of course that the devs are really ticking off the Elm community with that and people lose trust in the future of the language. With Red it might be even more of a special case due to the rocky history of Rebol 3's development, so people are already on edge.

rebolek

[12:34](#msg5b4de26bcad358639d5eee7d)If you know the language, it's easy to build it yourself, but newcomers tend to download latest stable release, that - being one year old - is bit buggy which is not great first experience.

cryptowyrm

[12:46](#msg5b4de5098fe2780689bcd518)True. Although there are even automated builds, so I guess you could add a note to the download page that says the last stable release is a little outdated by now so you might want to try the daily build if you run into issues.

As for the bugs, so far I've only encountered bugs in 0.6.3 when using functions in objects and when using random/seed, so for me it wasn't that bad. But maybe I was just lucky so far :)

I agree completely that it's best for newcomers, when we have so many new things in place. But look at all that has happened in the past year. We now have a number of people helping out part time, which is fantastic, but some things require a more full time commitment, or specialized skills. We're working on that, too.

[22:27](#msg5b51103ec579673e6b80c8f6)@giesse very interesting!  
btw don't you think it would make more sense for `object` to return an `object!`? since:  
\- that's what the keyword says  
\- the keys apparently are all words (not integers or strings or whatever), and `object!` supports that just fine  
\- object lookups are 3-5 times faster

giesse

[23:22](#msg5b511d4e63cf1636bddca34d)it's harder to build a object incrementally. i was thinking of doing `construct body-of map` and return that, but, is there really an advantage? (having lots of objects in a tree, like in my example, can be pretty heavy, so i don't know if lookup speed alone justifies it)

[23:24](#msg5b511da8c579673e6b80eb9e)I'm not opposed to it, if people prefer `object!` i'll certainly change it to do that

[05:20](#msg5b52c28c32fa1b7408578f15)For GUI/animation issues, redirect the tickets to @qtxie.

[05:22](#msg5b52c324c579673e6b851c93)@giesse For Parse, the definitions for `fail`, `break`, `reject` need extra design work. Propositions are welcome to improve them. Parse semantics in Rebol are constrained by implementation. Similarly, Red's Parse has a different set of constraints, so some semantics that Rebol cannot support might be doable in Red, and vice versa. BTW, `then` implementation in Red is flawed, each time I had a look at Rebol's version of it, I feel it is not intuitive nor easy to grasp, nor even really useful. So, this is another Parse topic that needs to be discussed and analyzed more deeply. As I am too busy with the GC and Red/C3 work for now, I would very welcome if you guys can investigate that topic and draw a conclusion on it in a consensus.

[05:24](#msg5b52c37f63cf1636bde0cb3f)We still have some finishing work to do on the GC branch, then @qtxie will switch back to master, to fix the regressions and prepare for 0.6.4 release.

[05:30](#msg5b52c50ff02a0977a3ed9604)Let me also say that it's really a joy for me to see an increasing number of very skilled people here diving more into design and implementation of Red. Feels like the early and glorious days of Rebol in 99/00 are back again. :+1:

giesse

[16:32](#msg5b53600e26bfd636be3cc5ff)I think that the best approach is to start from actual needs from people writing actual programs, and address those needs. So it's harder without having a big code base from a lot of different people to look at.

It might very well be that once you have `if` etc. in `parse` then `fail` is not needed. It might be that it does make the code more natural in some cases though. I'm not a fan of designing in the abstract because it's so easy to be caught up in a lot of things that don't matter. The human brain is way to susceptible to delusion to let it go on unchecked. :D

[16:33](#msg5b53604fb2411177a260d547)I'll post more into the ticket but I think it would be best to either summarize what needs to be fixed/changed or create a new ticket with just the bugs and leave that one for more general discussion.

dockimbel

[12:26](#msg5b5477eef02a0977a3f101ca)I am thinking about adding a `/clean` or `/reset` refinement to `do` native that would unset all the words in global context set during the evaluation of the argument script. For people who care about keeping the console's memory usage low, that is a must, because as long as (big) data structures are referenced from global context, the GC can't do anything about them, and that will lead to an ever increasing memory usage in the console. Alternative options could be to provide a mezzanine for that instead of overloading `do`, or simply make it the default `do` behavior and provide rather a `/keep` option to keep the new values set in global context. All options are on the table.

[12:26](#msg5b5477f1f02a0977a3f10201)What do you think?

hiiamboris

[13:00](#msg5b547ff7c579673e6b889ca1)I was never bothered by \*console* memory usage. It can be restarted in a second anyway. If restart bothered me (but why?) and I had a way to free stuff by unset-ting it I could just gather all the words upon startup and write a mezz that unsets everything except those words in like one line or so.

dockimbel

[13:05](#msg5b548103f9ffc4664bf4e817)@hiiamboris I'm personaly not bothered by it, but I know that some users want an "ever-lasting" console session. Moreover, the console is just the main example, you could be running many scripts from some other apps (imagine a Red app running plugin scripts), and experience similar "leaking" only caused by kept references in global context.

9214

[13:06](#msg5b54814ae06d7e7409953372)@dockimbel `do/keep` would ease the pain of keeping things tidy and preventing leakage.

[13:07](#msg5b54817cc579673e6b88a0eb)With general purpose mezzanine we'll need a way to mark state of global context to revert to, no?

dockimbel

[13:08](#msg5b5481c0e06d7e7409953452)@9214 We just need to mark the end position of the global context words series and unset everything after it on `do` exit. Implementation is trivial. But the change is significant, so I prefer consulting with the community first about it.

9214

[13:08](#msg5b5481e432fa1b74085b00ce)&gt; Implementation is trivial.

Then mezzanine it is.

hiiamboris

[13:09](#msg5b5482034b880b3e6a3f4ad9)This concerns `do` on %files only? Or `load`-ed data too?

dockimbel

[13:09](#msg5b548213f10ffa0b48a45fff)@hiiamboris That's an open question. I would say both.

hiiamboris

[13:14](#msg5b54833ac331e035520d5df9)I think it should not clean up \*by default\*, since every module load and every internal use of `do` will transform into `do/keep`. And there can be a lot of these... `do/clean [any code that pollutes the global context]` makes sense. Then it will be easy to clean up after any piece of code, not just scripts/loaded scripts... also good for memory profiling use cases: fill+report+cleanup.

dockimbel

[13:17](#msg5b5483d69ddf5f4aadff02d9)Well, in all those cases, remember that it would only unset newly created global words. If existing data structures (referenced by older words) are modified, those changes will be kept. It is not a way to backtrack all changes made by a script to the existing environment (that would be a different topic), but just cleaning up the global context from newly created values.

9214

[13:18](#msg5b54841763cf1636bde43f82)@dockimbel I'd rather go with something like `unwind [code that leaks into global context]`

hiiamboris

[13:19](#msg5b548452c331e035520d649f)@9214 +1 for the choice of word

dockimbel

[13:19](#msg5b548471f477e4664ab4aa09)For the ability to completly backtrack the whole global environment to a previous state, that would require potentially heavy bookeeping on disk, logging all the possible changes. That is something I have in mind for a cool Red debugger, where you have the complete timeline of your app, and you can drag a cursor through it to access any possible state.

hiiamboris

[13:24](#msg5b5485a3c86c4f0b4727ceb3)Any chance of bookkeeping via making system/words a deep-reactor? Or is it very heavy performance-wise?

dockimbel

[13:26](#msg5b548602f10ffa0b48a46bee)@hiiamboris It would not capture all changes in the current way the ownership system works, as sub-owners (reactor objects like faces) would prevent the root deep-reactor to catch their internal changes. It might also slow down the performances significantly.

hiiamboris

[13:27](#msg5b548637f10ffa0b48a46c45)Ah! makes sense...

dockimbel

[13:28](#msg5b54868632fa1b74085b0c93)@hiiamboris If you (or anyone else) have ideas about how to design such global bookkeeping in an efficient way (probably would require low-level changes), you are welcome to write a proposal for it on the Red wiki.

hiiamboris

[13:33](#msg5b54878df02a0977a3f12618)Considering how little RAM console uses for daily tasks, it might be much much simpler and faster to just capture RAM images and restore them upon exiting the `unwind` or whatever function. More complex solution would be to implement some copy-on-write mechanism that will use the data in the image read-only and duplicate it into a new segment if it's written to.

[13:39](#msg5b548904e06d7e740995506e)Like make a new thread with readonly access to the image area, and when some routine tries to write there, an exception will occur and be caught by it. And the thread will relocate the referenced data.

dander

[19:23](#msg5b577c9ddb4bcb16e874bb76)I don't quite understand which things would be kept/cleared with the `do` refinements. Would someone mind giving some short examples of which things would be cleaned up? Would it apply to `word!`s but not `set-word!`s, for example?

hiiamboris

[19:50](#msg5b5782f3d2f0934551cbd648)@dander the original idea was to unset all words put into the global context after a certain point. Think of `any-word!`, but only those assigned to would have been affected.

dander

[20:53](#msg5b5791ddc0fa8016e734f734)@hiiamboris I'm still not quite understanding. At what point would the global context be cleaned up? Say if a few hours back I defined a function `foo: function [][bar: 123 print bar]`... I would still want `foo` defined... Otherwise what is the point of keeping the console open? Anyway, `bar` is `unset!` in this scenario anyway. What am I missing here?

9214

[20:56](#msg5b57927ea31e386158acdbdd)@dander `do [x: 1]` leaks `x` into global context, intentionally or not. `do/clean [x: 1]` does so too, but then either `unset`s it back as if it never been used, or reverts its value back if `x` was already defined.

dander

[21:00](#msg5b579356d2f0934551cc0e2f)@9214 that seems like a very useful capability to have, but doesn't it seem dangerous if it's being done automatically for you? How would you decide at what point those "leaks" are not relevant anymore?

[21:00](#msg5b57938293395d1d9646732e)I'm assuming this is part of the console behavior. Maybe that was the part I misunderstood?

9214

[21:01](#msg5b5793c4b1b9572ed3dabb42)I've faced situation where I want to evaluate an arbitrary code, but don't want to face the consequences of polluting global context and potentially blowing all of the existing stuff. `do/clean` would allow to do just that.

[21:04](#msg5b579479c0fa8016e734fe08)@dander as I understood, the rules of the game are such that garbage collector can't touch anything in the global context, so you need a mechanism to either clean it up, periodically, or prevent "pollution" in the first place. This is relevant to console only, yes.

dander

[21:09](#msg5b579579a31e386158ace743)Is there a way to distinguish what is clutter vs intentional? The part that creeps me out is the potential that stuff I was still using gets unset.

9214

[21:09](#msg5b57959832d98c2ed2b16e5b)&gt; Is there a way to distinguish what is clutter vs intentional

Yes, the usage of `do` and `do/clean`.

dander

[21:13](#msg5b5796835301255724c226b6)ahh, okay. I thought the discussion was about the \_implicit_ evaluation of stuff you type

[21:43](#msg5b579d86b1b9572ed3dad9c6)So the other approach of making it the default would essentially eliminate global assignment unless explicitly requested, right? I think that was my initial question about whether `set-word!`s in the 'root' block would be an exception.

[21:43](#msg5b579d961be9bb57bcbf9c02)Such a feature could also be leveraged toward sandboxed execution of un-trusted code as well, couldn't it?

[19:30](#msg5b5a2151a31e386158b44a86)Thanks @giesse, looks nice. Will review in more detail later.

[23:03](#msg5b5a532d3396495b333e8589)@giesse, I'm torn on time formatting. The code for it is great, and I've stolen your to this approach for byte formatting long ago. Just thinking about what's most useful. e.g.

```
>>     profile/show [[wait 1] [wait .25] [wait .5]]
Time                 | Memory      | Code
250ms                | 0           | [wait 0.25]
501ms                | 0           | [wait 0.5]
1000ms               | 0           | [wait 1]
```

Seems like `time!` values would be a better match there. Maybe for profiling we don't want to think in wall clock time and my brain needs a reset. I know it solves other problems with time and precision we have currently, which is good. You may also be right about `runs-per` not having much value.

[14:27](#msg5b5b2bc36dd1ab572344b476)Perhaps someone can access what would actually be required in order to integrate. I'm thinking  
1\. testing framework or best practice guide  
2\. ability to connect with continuous integration  
3\. multiple file projects (is there an import command to include other local files? I know you can import from a web address)  
4\. ability to read in json (for the test cases)

You don't need to invent your own exercise problems. Those and the test cases are done for you.

[15:59](#msg5b5b414f6dd1ab572345408b)Thanks @WildYorkies!  
1\) We have quick-test, but often roll specific test engines suited to a task or need.  
2\) Only as done on github today, but should be doable.  
3\) Modules are coming, but not here yet.  
4\) An official JSON codec is in the works, but we have a number of existing things to use for now.

Red is still Alpha, so we need specs to decide what is doable now, versus what needs to wait, e.g. for Full I/O and Modules. If someone champions it, we'll support them as best we can. The team is spread very thin right now though.

giesse

[16:46](#msg5b5b4c726dd1ab5723457239)@greggirwin perhaps there's no need to drop down to ms, but things get really hard to read for stuff that takes nanoseconds to run. Maybe it should keep the same unit for the entire table - so if you have one item taking a minute, it will show everything in `time!` format, and stuff that insignificant compared to that is just shown as insignificant.

I suspect though that when you are profiling you are usually comparing things that are relatively close to each other, so that would happen automatically.

greggirwin

[19:13](#msg5b5b6edfdefc9823f51dc26f)Consistency is helpful in output, but later someone could add graphing to show scale differences. Or as percentages relative to the best.

Sometimes, in our informal playing with `profile`, we've been surprised by the outcomes. For me, `time!` is nice because--and this is just me--I could use `/count`, see a human scale time and decide in a very coarse way if something was going to be a problem.

[15:00](#msg5b5f27fd966e8039502e04ab)@guraaku Regarding IDE support, best way would be to build a Language Server Protocol implementation for Red. That way, you could have syntax highlighting, autocomplete, etc... for multiple IDEs. It's something that's slowly becoming the standard across multiple IDEs. https://langserver.org/

greggirwin

[18:20](#msg5b5f56d7defc9823f527d77e)@guraaku, I came to Rebol from VB, and QB before that, and Turbo* tools, and QuickC, and thought I'd always want an IDE. However, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and others just seemed to grow, like Office apps, where most of the time a very simple editor or spreadsheet will meet most needs. I understand the reason, but even with doing a fair amount of GUI work with VID, I've never missed an IDE. It's subjective though.

There are times where a drag-drop GUI designer is helpful, as non-devs can use them. I've built a couple simple ones through the years, as have others. I hope we'll see more people try things, and build \*enough* tooling to help, without going overboard.

The real and important question is what features will be the most helpful. Auto-complete is valuable in an environment where there are tens of thousands of static classes and properties, with no hope of remembering them all, but to help people use features and libs correctly, you still need docs. And popup docs may not lead to deeper understanding. Helpful in a moment, but not designed for building knowledge.

We'll see more specialized tools. I can almost guarantee it. ;^)

[18:26](#msg5b5f584df52b276ced53186e)It's a big question, that leads us both to Red's Logo heritage, and how to teach problem solving skills from an early age, to the other extreme where PitL, massive software failures, Robert Glass, Capers Jones, Steve McConnell, Karl Weigers, Watts Humphrey, and others have so much to teach us about what works in practice. They come from our industry's history, and some will write them off as out of date. Instead, they'll say we should learn from today's behemoths and emulate them. But we can't. Not always.

Finding the sweet spot, in tooling and process, isn't one-size-fits-all. And Red is so different, that we have a chance to really shake things up and improve how software is made. Let's do \*that\*.

[18:31](#msg5b5f599acb4d5b036ca918fa)As an example, look at @toomasv's recent work in red/gui-branch, and his collection of gists. His arc example, and others are specific not just to the `draw` dialect, but an element of it. With tools like that, and some of our "Lab" tool ideas, you can play, learn, and sometimes also generate code.

endo64

[19:45](#msg5b5f6af0defc9823f528131c)Instead of a complete IDE it would be very nice to have a source code level debugger, integrated with console, with support of breakpoints. For example, a `stop` word halts the execution and drops you into a console session which you probe and change the values then continue execution. A good debugger is always a good feature of a IDE.

[05:21](#msg5b5ff1d5cb4d5b036caa837a)Mostly to learn Red, I am moving ahead with my plans to cobble together an IDE, starting with some code from @mikeparr that I found. I should be ready to post version 0.0.1 to Github in about three weeks (no promises -- next week I am on vacation). In the meantime, I have a task I would like some help with, if anybody is interested. I would like to have two panes in my IDE for code (one for the project, and one for copy and paste, or looking at system code, or an inspector). It would be nice if the two panes would be two panes of your favorite text editor. To do that, I need at the minimum for Red to open and position your favorite text editor. Ideally, the text editor could talk back to Red, but that is not required. Is it even possible? Can anyone open a normal Red view window that contains a button. When you press the button, your favorite text editor opens at screen position 300x300, and contains the text from the file %myTextFile.txt. Bonus points if Red can pull changed text back out of the text editor, and push text into the text editor that is not from a file. Thanks.

greggirwin

[17:45](#msg5b60a04ff52b276ced574aaf)@accumulism it depends on the OS and the editor. On Windows you can certainly use the API to launch other apps and pump messages to them to set the position and such. I did that a lot in R2. Old code might be somewhere online, or I can dig it up. That's not a general solution though, which is much more work.

You could check out the Red Live Code examples https://gist.github.com/DideC/85d60c99f97f2e4972a6f7b09a1fe630 or https://github.com/red/code/tree/master/Showcase should get you started.

CodingFiend\_twitter

[20:10](#msg5b6213a844812258444d3a3d)@greggirwin with regards to what Gregg said earlier about the older knowledge from the industry, like that of Robert Glass, and Capers Jones, there are aspects of eternal truth in their work; for example the Capers Jones idea was that languages had an intrinsic measurable power to them, measured by means of brevity. the shorter the program, the more powerful the language. Red by this measure is an extremely powerful language. However, Robert Glass points out in his book that 40 to 80% of all cost of software is in maintenance of existing code. And in this area, Red may not excel. The higher the power level of a language, the more difficult it can be to read, because more is happening under the hood. All evidence shows that the industry selected for highest number of billable hours, which steered them towards COBOL, then Java, its successor language. I think that we in the new language community should acknowledge that inertia is the most powerful force in the universe, and that the mainstream programmers will never adopt an efficient, compact notation to replace Java because it would mean the loss of too many billable hours. It would be like asking lawyers to adopt standardized forms for court cases, and end the practice of making custom documents for routine items. In the legal world, the bulk of costs of a lawsuit are done during discovery phase, and then most cases are settled by court date, which means discovery costs were wasted. If lawyers stopped doing this their incomes would plummet. The next gen powerful, but simple languages, will forever be a relatively small proportion of the usage space. It doesn't mean it isn't worth building these tools; definitely it is worth doing, but let's not be overly optimistic that programmers industry-wide are willing to see their incomes drop. Just as in law, there is a relatively fixed number of disputes happening per year, and there is also a relatively fixed amount of software to be built. It isn't infinite. Once one company builds a great self-driving car software suite, there won't be need for 100 others. Once you have built a bug-free stack for 5G cellular radio, it will last 10 to 20 years. There is a lot of inertia out there, and inferior technologies like object oriented programming, which is one of the greatest boondoggles ever foisted upon the business community has only been discredited to a small number of malcontents such as myself.

[07:29](#msg5b62b2da79bfdf5c9989f97d)Since I'm using `bind` it would be ignored silently.

The main reason to have `/to` is to handle the case where you want to export to a "parent" context rather than the global context. I'm not even sure it's useful; I don't think it's worth putting more effort into it since it's just a stop-gap measure while we wait for modules.

[11:31](#msg5b62eba4cf8ab4758a920f24)Hi @CodingFiend\_twitter , you said "but let's not be overly optimistic that programmers industry-wide are willing to see their incomes drop". That may be the case if they are, like lawyers, billing someone for their services, ie your typical employee. However if they have some stake in the results of their labour, then languages or tooling or techniques which let them produce products quicker and better than their competitors then this competitive advantage could drive adoption of these technologies.

[11:32](#msg5b62ebdbcf8ab4758a920f91)But yes, there is a lot of inertia to keep on using older or more popular stuff.

[07:19](#msg5b65537085278d705e81de9e)For me, the "power" of Redbol is its expressiveness and how easily it maps to the real world. It lets you focus on the problem without having to worry about the boilerplate. The power of being able to write "read http://red.com" and for it to "work out of the box" is truly amazing and, I'd argue, makes code easier to understand and maintain. I'm maintaining a huge Rebol codebase and being able to quickly look at a script written 5 years ago and know \*exactly* what it does is a godsend.  
I also get regularly asked by non-technical staff "what does this script actually do" and I'm able to literally cut &amp; paste the relevant lines to them (inclusive of brief comments) ... something that's not possible with other languages (bar extensive comments). I've even had experienced developers ask me, "but where's the actual code?" :)

[04:33](#msg5b69210e04436a1ae6277254)With little change you can have a `split` function which takes parse rules for delimiters also:

    series [any-string!] dlm [string! char! bitset! block!] 
	/local s

[08:11](#msg5b6954478eb2d52fde56da5d)@toomasv did you just add `block!` to `dlm` parameter? If so we can consider adding this change to `split` function.

toomasv

[08:14](#msg5b6954ec04436a1ae62889ac)@endo64 I added `block!` type to `dlm` spec and removed `num`. Original is here:

```
split: func [

    series [any-string!] dlm [string! char! bitset!] 
    /local s num

    num: either string? dlm [length? dlm] [1]

            copy s [to [dlm | end]] keep (s) num skip [end keep ("") | none]

greggirwin

[21:23](#msg5b6a0de33bca002dcbd6a239)@rebolek, `join`, in Rebol's design is a non-modifying append. If we make it like `rejoin`, it's just redundant, yes? Not much value if it doesn't also reduce.

But thing is, if we don't care about R2 compatibility at all, then there's a bunch of other things that I'd do very differently - `object!` and `parse` being the most notable.

toomasv

[08:00](#msg5b6aa3128eb2d52fde5e62df)My `join` differs considearably from Rebol's and probably I should rename it to avoid further confusion. It is meant only for concatenation of stringy values with some delimiter. IMO it is convenient to have first arg separately, because it determines the type of the output. Joined values from the second argument can be of different types, `append` takes care of their conversion. I meant it as complementary to the current `split` which also deals with stringy values only, and I was mainly concerned about developing the delimiter DSL.

So welcome Lucinda, and another example of the first thing that came up for me a text from a GN'R song, "What we've got here is failure to communicate". This could have been announced on the blog or another blog than the one on the mainpage, or an info page. Also that some new stuff is stumbled upon as by accident like the progress page. Lots of work for PR waiting on ya!

[16:33](#msg5b7061675762ee4fe56794e6)@iArnold \*I* suggested asking here, as this is where our most active users are. We can, of course, do more later. What's \*wrong* with doing it here?

pekr

[18:13](#msg5b7078e75ec2bc174fec33ac)@greggirwin I think that @iArnold is not agains introduction of Lucinda here, but the lack of the official communication. The last roadmap update was posted at the end of March. We surely all know, that the Team is busy, and also you are very active here, but we've also got some ppl here, who are interested in the Red technology itself (and yes, I know, that in order for it to succeed, we need the crypto stuff), so some ppl might be eager to know, when e.g. 0.6.4 gets released and a typical "what's next" type of blog / tweet posts :-)

[02:51](#msg5b70f237179f842c972dae9e)@pekr, that's how I understood his post as well, and why I wanted to point out that this was \*my* call. The reasoning is easy. I felt we would get better input from this channel than the blog. If we put up a new blog entry, with just this in it, do you think that would satisfy people? Or would they say "Really, all this time and that's all you have to show for it?"

Of course, if we were doing better at PR, we wouldn't need Lucinda or others to help, right? ;^)

Red Update:  
\- Lots of new things in official docs, thanks to @gltewalt  
\- Wiki reorganized and pages tagged, thanks to @gltewalt and @endo64

mydoghasworms

[06:39](#msg5b7127ab988005174ed05496)@greggirwin Sorry, I am coming in at the tail end of this discussion about the frequency of public updates...  
\*Another option* would be to not make the blog the entry point of the Red website but rather have some sexy show-off kind of stuff on the main page and make the blog a secondary page. That way, the first thing that hits you isn't "Oh, this project has not been updated for a long time" but rather people can think "Hey, look at this cool language and the stuff you can do with it!". No need to disclose the length of time since an update as the first encounter with the website ;-)  
Some nice examples would be the Crystal Language website or the Ruby website. But there are tons of others.

[07:04](#msg5b712d8349932d4fe4d4ab78)@greggirwin And now, looking back at the discussion, I see I have not had the complete context of what it was about... Anyway, I would still put forward my suggestion for the website, although I do think it wouldn't harm to give more updates more frequently, even if they are small and seemingly insignificant. So what if people say "Really, all this time and that's all you have to show for it?". I think it would be worse if people are led to believe the project is stagnant or (even worse) dead - but making the blog not be the main focus of the website is definitely a way to mitigate this.

[11:30](#msg5b716bd35762ee4fe56d2943)a great idea to give at least some Red Update. About where, there is too much where. Update the blog that one doesn't have to look in all the red threads here to find some info, i would say.

We do put an onus on our users today, an expectation that leads to more work if they want to know what's going on. As I said to Arnold privately, we're doing our best, and this is a FOSS project. Anyone, at any time, could collect data and summarize for others. Many hands make for a light load, and we are enormously grateful to those who are contributing in so many areas.

We now have a great experimental progress page, thanks to @x8x: https://progress.red-lang.org/ But that's just commits, and still not Human Friendly. We're working on how to leverage that.

[19:37](#msg5b75d267e9b96f2c981a208a)The concurrency design isn't frozen, and there doesn't have to be just one solution. What drives design decisions is the most common use case (expected), or what can be used to underlie other models. That is, sometimes you start with the most primitive building block, on which other things can be built.

[19:39](#msg5b75d2e9988005174eeb4fd9)Personally, I see value in both. I'm a big fan of the tuplespace model, but the best solution is the one that helps you express the intent most clearly.

meijeru

[12:55](#msg5b76c5d9157b9d34ef9d4109)I quote from the specs section 6.2:  
The user may access the context of a word reflectively through the built-in function context? which can be applied to any word and will yield the context the word is bound to. Since contexts themselves are not values of a type of the language, they are yielded in the form of an object or function as the case may be. The context of a word which is a field of an error value is yielded as an object having the same field names and values as the error. The global context is yielded as the object system/words. The index of a word in its context may be obtained through the built-in function index?.  
So the short answer is yes.

9214

[16:16](#msg5b76f4e3e2e48a20b4719b30)@endo64 in Red, function's contexts are pushed / popped to / from evaluation stack during function call, in R2 they are allocated on the heap as `object!`s. So this behavior is an expected one.

[20:50](#msg5b81c1101d3a5711b69a1d47)I want to share a discovery I made in trying to specify "selection by key" in series values notably blocks: `select` uses `find` and `find` tests for equality in order to determine if an occurrence can be found. Now equality comes in three flavours: `=` `==` and `=?`. I found that `find` uses a weakened version of `==` which is case-insensitive for `any-word!`, and `any-string` values, something which is normally belonging to `=`. Thus the equality test of `find` is in between `=` and `==`. And please note that it is NOT case-insensitive for `char!` values.

[18:53](#msg5b8d8321d8d36815e5cf2f44)Even more... the lexer could recognize this:

```
>> #"61-7A"

One could than use it in parse rules without need to define repeatedly variables like:

parse data [some alpha-chars]
```

meijeru

[19:17](#msg5b8d88ae11b41f69dbb5ff9c)@Oldes You yourself supply a powerful argument against: compatibility with strings; also don't underestimate the self-documenting properties of `charset [#"a" - #"z"]` and the increased error-proneness of #"2E" (easy to type the wrong number of characters).

Oldes

[19:17](#msg5b8d88e5f86b741b05043434)Hm.. maybe you are right... but I had to write code like `alpha-chars: charset [#"a" - #"z"]` so many times:/ I would prefer not to write it at all.

meijeru

[19:29](#msg5b8d8bb64be56c5918d892b4)Also, your example of #"2E" being the dot `.`, it has already a pre-defined word in Red, namely `dot` (surprise :smile\_cat: )

Oldes

[19:31](#msg5b8d8c0ef5402f32aad219c7)Ok... I should use other example:

```
label-chars: charset [#"^(21)" - #"^(2C)" #"^(2E)" - #"^(7E)"]
```

could be:

```
label-chars: charset [#"21-2C" #"2E-7E"] ;any printable character, except hyphen-minus
```

[20:34](#msg5b8d9acf4be56c5918d8eb61)At least in Red is possible to write more compact charsets, like:

```
base64-chars: charset [#"a"-#"z" #"A"-#"Z" #"0"-#"9" #"/" #"+" #"="]

[21:03](#msg5b8da1b194f8164c17d827f5)But you know... I get these values from RFCs and it is simpler to just copy what they use and don't convert it to numbers.

giesse

[21:09](#msg5b8da2fbcff55e5617a17d4a)Yeah but it would be much more readable to use something like

```
>> ascii: charset [32 - 127]
== make bitset! #{00000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF}
>> difference ascii charset " -^~"
== make bitset! #{000000007FFBFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFE}
```

IMHO... and usually it would be expressed like that in the RFC too.

[21:09](#msg5b8da30611b41f69dbb6a48a)so it's clear what's NOT allowed

[21:11](#msg5b8da365d8d36815e5cff798)but i do like the idea of a compact literal form for charsets

[21:15](#msg5b8da48d94f8164c17d831fe)I think that having `#"2E"` be the same as `#"^(2E)"` (and `#"002E"` for `#"^(002E)"`) wouldn't be a big problem. just saves some typing. it could be argued that it would hide some typos like `#"22"` instead of `#"2"` for eg. and it could be confusing for new people.

[21:18](#msg5b8da519c2bd5d117a14cfbf)the question is, do we really want `#"abc"` to be a charset while `#"a"` is a char. it would be appealing in `parse` rules as you say. but it feels like too tricky.

Oldes

[21:18](#msg5b8da51dd457a1406c9cee81)in RFC is for example:

```
labelchar  = %x21-2C / %x2E-7E    ; any printable character,
                                    ; except hyphen-minus
```

giesse

[21:19](#msg5b8da563cff55e5617a18a6b)right, but my example above would more easily read as "except hyphen-minus" which they \*had* to put in a comment there.

[21:21](#msg5b8da5d311b41f69dbb6b63e)I don't know, it's something to think about, but consider how you'd write that in a regular expression as well.

Oldes

[21:22](#msg5b8da5fbf5402f32aad2b4b9)You are right... but than we are again in a need of some way where to store common charsets like your `ascii`, but as usually I will just use it in another place.

[09:30](#msg5b9396b27667e11554c14b6b)Beside me there are a score of young scientists hacking programming, first with Mathematica and SPSS, later due to lack of funds for licensing they switched to R-Lang, and lately they got a course of Python and are testing now, they tell me that their job is not to program, but to investigate and extract valuable info from big data, so they were forced to learn programming.  
The last thing they want is a complex language, they are looking for something fast and easier, Red will be the answer when full I/O where deployed, because it is human-oriented, what will make them use Red will be their easyness, not ambiguity or duplicity of operators, I think that is the way to success, not to think only being used by professional programmers, but in everybody who has the need to program.

9214

[09:45](#msg5b939a4551a02e2a26fc9650)&gt; Red will be the answer

No, it won't. Red lacks support for numerical and scientific computing (not to mention concurrency), and its package ecosystem is non-existent.  
Matlab, R and Python (and recently Julia) will stay there, because they can do all of the above out of the box.

&gt; what will make them use Red will be their easyness, not ambiguity or duplicity of operators

Sorry, but this is too far from the truth. "Non-techie" scientists will use whatever their supervisors told them to use, or will settle up on whatever toolchain is the standard among the team. Usually it's either Python or R. You can't go against the grain with your naive "but it's human-oriented and easy to use, and it got I/O support recently!".

The only place where Red can be succesfully integrated into data analysis pipeline is data munging and cleansing, but, last time I tried to do that, the result left a bad taste in my mouth. It was anything but "fast and easier", even for trivial CSV processing.

ericguedespinto

[10:15](#msg5b93a13dcddb292dff41983e)I guess that is what ‘alpha’ status means. Still no IO, no substancial ecosystem and not yet optimised. Red will get there! The issue with the operators can be easily overcome with a simple script import. Integrating with data analysis pipeline can likewise be extended on the fly without including these operator shortcuts in the base language but with parse rules for a specific dialect if needed.

[10:16](#msg5b93a173e481f854a6899016)Overall it could hurt consistency of the language

[10:22](#msg5b93a2d8550f8808f57bc3f1)The syntax of Redbol is so different from C like syntax that if you want to change you can easily learn the new op!

9214

[10:28](#msg5b93a43445318b2dfe7af1e6)&gt; Red will get there!

... and in the meantime scientists will use whatever they used to, with only a few of them biting the bullet and utilizing Red for very specific set of problems (usually creation of a tool or prototyping).

&gt; The issue with the operators can be easily overcome with a simple script import

If all you care is a fancy look - sure, we have UTF-8 support with all its niceties, but at the functional level it's more than that. How to handle arity and precedence, prefix and postfix? Vectorization? What if operator can't be `load`ed and contains forbidden symbols?

&gt; a specific dialect

There's no need to \[reinvent](https://tryapl.org/) the wheel of "domain-specific language for data analysis".

planetsizecpu

[11:06](#msg5b93ad4e7ce5f5314f7f5691)@9214 I think you are mistaken in what supervisors want, I'm in daily contact with them and even with management, the matter is: free and fast, they aren't much concerned in what researchers are using, just want results they need in time.

But you are right, there is no ecosystem companion for Red and numerical computing, also lack of 64 bit, as you know this is matter of time. There are some operations that will fit perfect to Red I/O, they are currently doing ETL, from sensor devices to Databases, they are not comfortable with Python and Rlang, and this is a task Red will do right even in single console!, this could be just the starting point to be stoned by Red, after that you can't leave it (as I did 😆)

ericguedespinto

[11:21](#msg5b93b0bd0fb4232e3892e11e)@9214 I agree with you and I have also asked here in the forum if there is a matrix! datatype in the works and what would it take to make Red do proper neural network AI. The truth is that Red is still in alpha and given the pace it is still going to be there for a while. AI will likely find a standard in Tensorflow/Keras and with google and apple getting involved they will probably make the standard, including a binary format for pre-compiled and incremental training of NN. I think that Red is still far away from that and maybe the blockchain branch will introduce significant changes to the mix (distributed apps, security, IO). Red is still in a 'flow' state and breaking changes are bound to happen. It is not a finished or stable product and I do not think that researchers like us should wait. The token economics and the blockchain branch are the stated priorities for the project and that will take precedence for the forseable future (months or years). However, as you've said, Red will be great for prototyping a tool and making integration with other tools.

9214

[11:29](#msg5b93b2a8550f8808f57c1d3f)&gt; you are mistaken in what supervisors want

Oh really? They want results, and they want them \*now* (or yesterday). So, you go to your team, and the majority of them use Python. So, if you want to deliver results fast, you won't argue about "uh but Red is so cool let me introduce it in our workflow" and start cooperating. It terms of built-in functionality Red has nothing to bring to the table: you need FFT - you either give up and use other language or roll out your own. Even for data plotting - it's Matplotlib with Plotly versus barebones Draw. To all "Red has X" they'll say "but Y can do this too, why bother?".

&gt; matter of time

Yeaaah, and then modules with libraries will start to sporadically emerge out of thin air, all by themselves! There's a lot of grunt work to do if you \*really* want to compete. As of now, I don't see anyone doing anything in this regard, except for @ldci.

&gt; they are not comfortable with Python and Rlang

I guess what they are uncomfortable with is programming itself, Python and R has little to do with that.

&gt; this is a task Red will do right even in single console

Well, no, it won't, unless someone who cares start to support whole ETL enchillada and design a toolchain to handle all of this.

[11:37](#msg5b93b48451a02e2a26fd298e)@ericguedespinto there's some ANN work being done behind the curtain by one of the old timers. I'll ping him and ask if he want to share the results.

9214

[11:46](#msg5b93b686728ddf02827a40a4)@planetsizecpu as you said yourself, data scientists don't care about programming, and here I pretty much agree. They can't bother less about clean and thoughtful language design with engineering best practices - these are all academical issues to them. If they have a gobbledygook which can solve their problem, and if they can copypaste it - no matter how ugly looking or poorly designed, they'll take it. Code written by scientits is a throw-away one, because all the static functionality is encapsulated into common libraries. All they do is swapping and shuffling of these core pieces around as they deem fit. It's library-driven development.

That is, I'll argue that your young data hackers don't want to write code at all, not even in Red or the next most beatiful language we've ever seen. They want a one-click solution.

[12:03](#msg5b93baa8151b090281e6651f)&gt; Why such a skepticism?

I just speak from my experience, that's all. I tried to use Red myself in scientific setting and got a pushback.

&gt; bosses really don't care

They don't, but team leads (who themselves participate in all the work side-by-side with you) do. If they can't make all of you to agree on what tool to use, they'll stick to the majority's choice. If you introduce an element that is not compatible with the rest of the system, or which no one knows how to use, they'll ask you to change your mind.

&gt; wrote some small data scrapping

And how \*small* is your data scrapping, if I may ask? There's a lot of data formats out there besides CSV, you know.

&gt; I don't quite understand, what your message is precisely about

I'm saying that, to appeal to the masses, we need functionality, and not fancy syntax with clever design. And to bring functionality, we need to work hard, as a community. Bare language won't solve any of the problems, no matter how feature-packed it is. There's still a need to evolve an ecosystem. All these "Red will do that easily and with few keystrokes!" statements are, IMO, unencumbered by reality.

ericguedespinto

[12:34](#msg5b93c1ee1e2b442a25e04ab2)I would argue that we need clever design of fancy syntax to support much needed functionality. I can say that I have felt the slow pace of development at times frustrating but, of course, I also want Red to be the best tool it can be and not a 'spaghetti' mess of unmaintainable modules which different people contribute but that could potentially make the syntax incoerent and provide for 'WTF' moments like in javascript. If I were a team leader I would surely stay away from any alpha language in any sensitive task and until we move closer to 1.0 I don't think that any amount of functionality will change that. That goes for blockchain as well - if we do not get close to 1.0, Red tokenomics will have a credibility issue simply because as 'alpha', it is still not ready for 'prime time'. But in the end we need first to get closer to 1.0 before we can think about appealing to the masses. I know that we will lose market share for scientific programming, but the strategic option was to aim at market share in blockchain (where there are no good competitors and we are more likely to appeal to the 'blockchain' masses..).

9214

[12:38](#msg5b93c2bf67a666314ec0ed90)&gt; I would argue that we need clever design of fancy syntax to support much needed functionality.

Indeed. But, in all honestly, I can't take things like "hmmm will addition of `||` operator increase our market share?" seriously. :joy:

pekr

[12:38](#msg5b93c2c9e481f854a68a382d)I am with Rebol for 20 years, so I will provide you with my observation. Beware - anyone's point of view might differ ...

Redbol languages are really streamlined. Also - before some new functionality was added, it was often deeply discussed, ditto for the correct naming, sometimes it felt almost absurd, well - to those, who did not care much. It had a strange effect on the whole ecosystem - there is not much libraries out there. Ppl wanted the basic frameworks being part of the language and ppl consciously considered lots of outer stuff as being an unnecessary or not well fitting bloat.

Another point of view - ppl tended to wait for RT to provide "the right" functionality. And then it happened - RT got short on resources and needed to think commercially. Here we can see a parallel with the Red imo - the team has to think long term. RT devoting its time to IOS almost killed a community. No new release for 18 months to the core language back then. Now Red - even less feature complete, the last release (0.6.3) more than one year ago.

Now - don't ask me, how to cure the situation. Community is not contributing much - is not used to maybe. Maybe ppl feel the lack of a leadership and short-term roadmap info. Maybe ppl feel the lack of some useful functionality (some waiting for GC, some for full IO, etc.). It needs strong &amp; skilled individuals to provide a quality content. We've got few cool guys here, so I don't feel Red is doomed, while I believe everybody would like to see the whole ecosystem to move forward in a faster pace.

As for a blockchain - if you want to find some niche, where Red could succeed, it's just that imo! I just hope that my message is not going to be once again understood as some trolling, etc. It is not ment to be ....

9214

[12:47](#msg5b93c4c8cddb292dff425f76)Well, yes, I agree that Rebol was never about programming in the large.

&gt; It needs strong &amp; skilled individuals to provide a quality content

This. This is why I'm highly against all these "Red is for everyone, let's bring non-programmers here!" sales pitches. What we need now, on the road to 1.0 (and even to 2.0), are enthusiasts, skilled engineers and professionals, everyone who has a will to learn and to help in the best of their abilities, and who deeply appreciates Red as a tool, with all its shortcomings. These people are the salt of the earth, and they are supposed to bring language forth into the world and maintain the whole homeostasis.

Instead we're ending up in a state which current `/help` room clearly represents.

[15:27](#msg5b93ea7ce481f854a68b1d5a)&gt; This is why I'm highly against all these "Red is for everyone, let's bring non-programmers here!" sales pitches.

Me too. First of all, if it was for everyone, it would already be popular. Additionally, I don't believe it is "easy" or even "intuitive", there are a number of leaps that need to be made at the start, \*then* the simplicity of the system makes it relatively easy.

Unfortunately a lot of people try to \*hide* the important parts to newcomers so they never make those leaps and spend all their time asking for help.

[22:04](#msg5b94476c7667e11554c5317f)Gregg's monthly PSA (Public Service Announcement):

Good topic. Let's keep it positive and look for answers, rather than what we disagree about.

If anyone knows of a study that correlates language design elements with popularity, that would be great to see. I don't know of any. For example, C is the most popular enduring language we know (cite contradicting evidence if you have it). Is that because of its syntax (other langs have imitated it, and also become popular)? Is it because of its purpose and applicability? Timing (when it was created), scope (small and simple), education system use, industry adoption, inertia, or all of the above?

@dander, `for` is an interesting example. I'm biased in favor of it, and also `forskip` though I didn't use either very often in R2. It wasn't the frequency of use, but those times where they made the intent clear. If we have better alternatives, we can point people to them. In the case of `for`, what is the better approach for looping, starting at an index other than 1 or incrementing but more than 1 on each pass? For `forskip`, given a set of fixed size records in a block, what is the best way to iterate over them? And what are the special features those funcs bring, which have to be handled manually without them?

Look at the reason some features exist at all in languages. A number of things in C were based on efficiency. Simple aliases \*may* be a good idea, especially when people need to adapt code and their brains. The training wheels should be optional, and easy to remove. We can also offer tools to help, because we can manipulate code so easily. e.g., an IDE could detect `!=` when typed, and replace it with `<>`. A \*tracking* IDE could see how long it takes the average programmer to start typing `<>` automatically.

[22:06](#msg5b9447c81e2b442a25e33ea1)Python is an interesting case. As I've noted, it makes code much more of a commodity, because of its regularity. That's great for business and learning. A lot of code could benefit from being like that. It has a cost though, and one Red won't pay at its core. BASIC was a simple language, but was still just for programmers. QuickBASIC as well, and others of that era. VB, along with the rise of Windows in business, made is possible for a lot of casual/non programmers to build applications. Of course HyperCard and others allowed enthusiasts to do that at a personal and even small business level. dBase or FileMaker anyone? Excel? Rebol IOS?

Note that those, even VB, are all \*applications\*. In some there is a language element, but that was not their selling point. Red, today, is just a language, and an incomplete one at that. But it's this important foundation that everything else will build on.

[22:06](#msg5b9447e633ebb72e37ec142a)We have picked our current target, with our focus on the blockchain aspect. But we still need to fill the gaps in the core to support that. \*And* we have to build a business so it's sustainable. The ICO was a huge success but, in spite of that, we are subject/victim to crypto volatility. Do the math. Plans made in January had to be adjusted. Heck, plans made a week ago had to be adjusted. The ICO also came at a huge cost in other obligations. Things we might call distractions. It wasn't just "Here's a bunch of ETH, now go and do what you really want for a year." If only that were true.

[22:08](#msg5b94485b45318b2dfe7e8fae)There's a solid core team, support from about a dozen people in a semi-official capacity, and we have a great community. As an open source project, we live or die by that community. Otherwise we could just build what we want, and provide dev and consulting services around that. But we want to change the world. We want to help fix what is broken in software development, all while paying our own bills and eating regularly. To do that, we need you. Every little bit helps. While we need a couple more deep, experienced system-level coders (point them to us if you know any), almost anyone can contribute in some way. Reach out. Tell us what your skills are, what you're interested in, how you're using Red, or specific roadblocks you hit with it. "I need Full I/O" is not specific. ;^) Specific is important, because if you are \*trying* to use it for something, that means you have needs and skills in that area. And you're probably not alone.

If you're waiting around, feel free to keep waiting. But I encourage you to play with Red, even just a little, regularly. You can build useful \*little* things so easily that there's no reason to wait. Rather than Sudoku, Red. Write little funcs, experiment and just have fun.

Numerous fixes in garbage collection, addressing crashes both with the recycling of red-symbol, and on macOS after allocating virtual memory. Quick-test.r saw a change, adding a pre call. On the Docs side, the percent! datatype was committed by @gltewalt, applying percent! to typesets number! and scalar!, and it has been added to SUMMARY.adoc.

And among Red community projects, Gritter, a Red Gitter client, has seen feature updates including the mapping of antecendent post-time periods. "Starting to be useful," writes @rebolek. In an update to the README.md of OTP/ssword, @planetsizecpu thanks Michael Caine and Pierce Brosnan for their great work, and notes that the otp generator is dependent upon user selected parameters for its strength, meaning it's on the user to determine how strong that password is.

[20:17](#msg5b96d159a04db554a707acb4)@x8x what i mean is that when writing documentation, people tend to use familiar concepts from other languages, to make it "easier" to understand; leaving things like binding as an "advanced topic" even though it's actually a core topic.

[00:14](#msg5b9708f07189ae6fdda77048)@dander The document has very useful content which I expect will be transferred to the Rebol Reference Manual.

I published a \[High-level Documentation Plan](https://github.com/red/REP/blob/master/REPs/rep-0003.adoc) last month. Once it is accepted, the Documentation Team will need to come up Table of Contents for each of the documents and then put them together.

[01:29](#msg5b971a66e481f854a69d66b7)@gltewalt perhaps, but in exchange for not scaring them right away you frustrate them after a few days. Personally, I don't think any of the core concepts should be scary. On the contrary, it should be beautiful.

greggirwin

[03:02](#msg5b973057a04db554a709d17a)A lot of it is how things are explained. You can't just say "there is no scope", but you can say "Red uses a novel approach, pioneered in Rebol, where words are bound to contexts. This mechanism is used to emulate scope, but allows more options. It's an important feature when thinking in terms of dialects."

[03:04](#msg5b9730bce481f854a69dd403)Or "Red provides scoping behavior that will feel very familiar, but once you peek under the hood, you'll see that a more general and powerful mechanism is hidden underneath."

[12:39](#msg5b97b78e1e2b442a25f6c08a)Why are some users comparing Red to language x/y/z? Red does not aim to mimic C or Java, so why bother with --/++/?: etc? There is no merit in mimicking the quirks or syntaxes of a different language. I will just turn Red into C/Java/Whatever. Why should we invent/do the same mistakes all over again? It reminds me of the hardware side we are stuck with currently. Everyone is aware that X86 is a dead-end, inferior tech and ancient bloat, still people keep up with it instead of trying/doing stuff for the better. Same with operating systems: re-inventing the same stuff all over again and wondering about the same outcome. If you want to use post/pre increment or tenary-operators, then just use a language, which is designed for them. No one is stopping anyone from doing the same failures all over again. If its wise to do so is a different question.

[15:54](#msg5b97e53733ebb72e3700f89d)@BeardPower I don't know the original question but: The Red/Rebol is not something \*\*very\** different than C, Java or Ruby. It's only natural to compare \*similar* languages.

xaduha

[16:41](#msg5b97f045550f8808f594bb3b)Hi, want to chime in about latest blogpost ("specific roadblocks you hit with it" part). It would be very nice if Red could work with http://websocketd.com out of the box, that instantly opens it up to some web programming, especially if you couple it with https://github.com/red/wallet/blob/master/libs/JSON.red

At the moment there are issues with buffering and `input` not being included by default when compiling. There are workarounds for this in Linux e.g. calling `fflush` or using `stdbuf -o 0` from shell. But at some point you're getting tired of stacking workarounds on workarounds.

BeardPower

[16:42](#msg5b97f08a1e2b442a25f84eae)@maximvl But you can only compare by its difference and understand why it makes sense. Adding the sane syntax as language X does not make sense if Red has a better and different design.

9214

[16:44](#msg5b97f0eae6e309365e398770)@xaduha the former will come with 0.7.0. The latter already has a workaround \[described](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BNOTES%5D-Compiling-with-console-functions) in our wiki, and most likely will be resolved on the road to 0.7.0 too.

BeardPower

[16:45](#msg5b97f125e481f854a6a2a4f3)@nedzadarek In fact Rebol and Red is absolutely different to C, Java and Ruby in every regard.

greggirwin

[19:42](#msg5b981a971e2b442a25f96f7e)@xaduha, what are the exact issues with buffering? If we can nail them down, we can open a ticket for them.

[19:43](#msg5b981aef45318b2dfe94f0a8)`Input` should not be a showstopper for that, as it's a REPL-oriented function.

nedzadarek

[21:08](#msg5b982ee0cddb292dff5c3551)@giesse It's depends what you want to compare. But, yes, learning by comparing things sometimes slows you down. I guess every learning method has pros and cons.  
@9214 take some low-level language like assembly language (not sure about correct term - I've not used it much). In this language you work on "memory addresses".  
In the constraint/logic programming you can just say, for example:  
\- I have 5 digits, `0`, `2`, `4`, `6`, `8` and  
\- I want \*\*number\** where every digit appears \*\*once\** (e.g. `02468`, `26480`) and  
\- it starts with `2` and  
\- it ends with `4`

and it will just output you a number.

[21:11](#msg5b982f65a2343433d134c333)@BeardPower the C, the Java and the Ruby have functions/methods like the Red/Rebol. So it's not in \*every* regard.

[21:12](#msg5b982fc8f59e0c1555e3b8d0)@nedzadarek I already know the difference between second and fifth programming languages generations, thanks.

[21:13](#msg5b98300f1e2b442a25f9f809)Following your logic, most programming languages are the same because they are based on textual representation.

[21:31](#msg5b98342633ebb72e3702f423)@9214 You're welcome.  
I don't mean "the same". I mean "not very different". Compare C &amp; Java, and C and Prolog. That kind of difference.  
Check his/her graphs: https://griffsgraphs.wordpress.com/2012/07/01/programming-languages-influences/ I mean something like this.

[21:50](#msg5b9838af33ebb72e370313f6)If you \*use* Red like C (or Ruby, in your case) it doesn't mean that they \*are* "not very different". I believe that only those who bumped the ceiling and mastered the language can make such judgements. Truth is, there's hardly any ceiling in Red or Rebol, and one defines his own limits.

And you contradict yourself with this graph - I see two distinct nodes for C and Rebol \*families* of languages, without any visible connections. Rebol itself inherits from Lisp, Forth and Logo. Would you argue that Lisp is not very different from C too? Or that Forth is like an Assembler, only for stack-based architecture?

greggirwin

[21:52](#msg5b98392a33ebb72e37031747)@nedzadarek broad, paradigmatic comparisons are pretty easy, and can be visualized as a simple matrix. You could do a second matrix at the implementation level.

The graph is interesting, but also has to be put in context. It makes perfect sense to me that Haskell would have a lot of related languages, because of its academic focus, and the likelihood that others will tinker and build on its core principles.

dander

[22:01](#msg5b983b31e6e309365e3b5bd7)@PeterWAWood I totally missed the documentation plan. It seems very sensible to me, and I think having something like that in place can also help to encourage contributions as it can clarify which parts are needed

[22:15](#msg5b983e86f59e0c1555e41143)@greggirwin  
&gt; In the case of for, what is the better approach for looping, starting at an index other than 1 or incrementing but more than 1 on each pass?

I find that I have almost never had this kind of need in practice, but if I did, I think I would maybe prefer to use HOFs for this. It all depends on what the sequence represents... But it's hard to speculate without some concrete examples where the need arises :^)

xaduha

[22:28](#msg5b98419c550f8808f596b804)@greggirwin it's not really that Red does something particularly out of the ordinary here, you can look at other examples of other languages here http://websocketd.com, many need to flush their `stdout` for it to work. And `input` or `ask` is needed for user input, what other way is there for that? That's how websocketd works.

Small snags here and there, no idea how it's on macOS atm, doesn't really work on Windows. I can describe them and they will sound trivial, but they add up. Not user friendly at all.

greggirwin

[22:32](#msg5b98428b51a02e2a2617cdb0)@dander, I remember using them quite a bit in mortgage calculations, but one of the most useful things in Red is time ranges at increments. e.g. load a list with 8:00 - 17:00 in steps of 00:15.

[22:36](#msg5b984361e6e309365e3b8f47)@xaduha, as @9214 said, that's where we need ports. e.g., in R2, `system/ports/input` was used to read STDIN. `Input/ask` are strictly for direct console use.

nedzadarek

[23:16](#msg5b984cb1cddb292dff5ce6a7)@9214  
&gt; If you use Red like C (or Ruby, in your case) it doesn't mean that they are "not very different".

If it's not forced then languages are not very different. A language can have different ways to do things, but in at least in one aspect they are similar.

&gt; And you contradict yourself with this graph

First, I mean

and from his/her site:  
&gt; Again, keep in mind the limited dataset – this is only an exercise in exploration!

Lisp vs C? Forth (I used the Factor) vs Assembler?  
... just compare details not "wholeness".

[00:09](#msg5b98594033ebb72e3703ca32)Personally, I feel all the issues related to the problems understanding "binding et al" derive from the use of the term binding to describe how things are implemented rather than conceptually.

Oliver Auverlot provided a very good and understandable analogy to language dictionaries in his book "The Rebol Programmers Guide".

A word is dependent on it's context. For example, what does the word air mean? Well, in English it is the stuff we breathe but in the Malay language it is the liquid that we know as water in English.

In Rebol and Red you can have any number of your own dictionaries (which are usually referred to as contexts). A word can have a different meaning in each dictionary.

When Rebol and Red bind a word to a "context", all it means conceptually is to use the word that is in a specific dictionary.

greggirwin

[00:38](#msg5b98601c33ebb72e3703f2f4)I think using "dictionary" that way will lead to more confusion, as it's also a common term used for map/associative-array. Saying words have meaning in a given context is a good fit. The next step is to explain how a word "knows" in what context it is being used.

JacobGood1

[03:27](#msg5b9887ba728ddf028296119b)I will have to agree that prolog is more different to java/etc than red is to java/etc, however, red is definitely very different from those languages as well. Definitional scope, bindology, and homoiconicism allow a red programmer to do things that java/etc programmer cannot even imagine, because they think in java/etc. I am assuming etc. is another language/s near the lower end of the power spectrum. By the way, using prolog as the standard for difference is cheating =)

giesse

[04:28](#msg5b9895fb728ddf0282965f02)@PeterWAWood sure... but that doesn't clear the confusion IMHO. Each word is directly connected to a value contained in a context. It's a subtle but important difference that comes up in many cases. In particular, a lot of people assume that the context is like scope in other languages, so there is a "current context" and the interpreter looks up words in the "current context". But that's not true - each word value is connected directly to another value contained in a context. There is no concept of "current context" or "scope"; scope is emulated by carefully binding words to the right values during normal operation. But, it's an illusion, and it crumbles the moment you do anything slightly out of the ordinary (like, `do` on a string, which newcomers like to do a lot, because that's what they know from other languages).

planetsizecpu

[06:36](#msg5b98b4091e2b442a25fcea4d)But the main question we are discussing is whether or not to say that Red is a language for everyone who want to use it, and not only to programmers. At first is Carl's article stating it is not for every one ..., there also is the complexity question and eventual frustration by this complexity, and also lack of scientific functionality question.

So there arise some questions to ask themselves:

Is Rebol/Red a human oriented language?  
Are tasks written in Rebol/Red easier to develop and thinner than in today's used languajes?  
Are these languages free of (and at all more) complexity than Rebol/Red?  
Is still sustainable today (ten years later) Carl's opinion about that question, when whe have Red, Red/system and other dialects?  
Is Red toolchain thinner that these others, so you don't mind in downloading and testing it?  
Is there a Red team and community ready for answer newcomer's questions?  
Is there a reason for experts in other sciences (non programmers) can not test, use or learn Red?  
We are able to stop them if they are willing?  
Why not encourage them if they are already using other languages? It is something wrong?  
Why make assumptions about what people will feel when using Red, like frustration?

Something to think about before to put sticks on people's wheels.

PeterWAWood

[09:15](#msg5b98d9280fb4232e38b0ddef)@giesse You are, of course, correct. I need to give some deeper thought to extending the analogy.

BeardPower

[10:12](#msg5b98e6717ce5f5314f9daae4)@nedzadarek If you compare it by syntax, no, they are not the sane. If you compare it by nomenclature, they all have functions, then yes. But then you can also say that a book is similar to a programming language because both use characters.

[10:14](#msg5b98e6e80fb4232e38b12c4f)@nedzadarek Every programming language, not only assembler, is working on memory addresses/registers, because that's how a computer works. A programming language is just an abstraction. All you can do is writing to and reading from memory, nothing more.

nedzadarek

[10:43](#msg5b98edef550f8808f59aa1c2)@BeardPower about memory addresses:  
I mean how "direct" given programming language is.  
Let's look at 3 languages: the BF (instead of Assembler, for simplicity), the C and the Red.  
In the BF you increment/decrement 1 byte memory cell at given address (by moving the pointer).  
In the C you declare/define some variable, allocate some part of the memory and put some data using loops for example.  
In the Red you just say \*I need a block\*. The programming language will take care about allocating and managing memory things.

About comparison:  
Why do you people take everything to the extreme? Or just think in the terms of true or false?

@greggirwin what's wrong with a \*dictionary\*? I guess "object" is a better term?

BeardPower

[10:52](#msg5b98eff7e6e309365e3f4dfe)@nedzadarek Still, all are just abstractions of writing to and reading from memory. No, memory management is not done by the language. This is the task of the compiler and the run-time. Some languages don't even have a run-time or let you choose the level of abstraction (like C or Red).

[10:54](#msg5b98f056728ddf0282988796)BF: a pointer is writing to memory  
C: declaring/defining is just writing to memory  
Red: a block is just writing to memory

[10:54](#msg5b98f0810fb4232e38b168d5)The only difference is the abstraction on how you can write to memory.

[10:57](#msg5b98f1001e2b442a25fe7b66)How direct/indirect the language is, depends on it's abstraction level. Many languages offer different levels of abstractions (C, Ada, Red...).

@nedzadarek, just what I said in my reply to Peter, that it's an overloaded term. We could introduce it into the Red lexicon, but we already have `context`, which I think is better for talking about this subject.

Thanks, all, for moving the other topic to chit-chat.

[07:22](#msg5b9a103c7dca306503f3aa1a)@gshields It is a known issue, you need to be in the same folder to be able to use red.exe. Adding it to PATH env doesn't help. It is a limitation of current version, when Red will be self-hosted we won't have this issue. Additionally, you can create a .bat file that takes one argument and does what you have done above:

```

9214

[09:44](#msg5b9a31750cfe7f30f189d5f1)@greggirwin what everyone seems to forget is that context is not an object (technically), and object is not a context. Rather, it \*provides* a context. Functions, when called with a set of arguments, provide contexts too. I believe we already have a well-established glossary, and there's no need to reinvent the wheel and make terms more "accessible", and, at the same time (paradoxically), confusing.

nedzadarek

[10:48](#msg5b9a407f1ee2ca65020daef1)@greggirwin but then you have to explain context, Peter said:

&gt; In Rebol and Red you can have any number of your own dictionaries

If you change it into \*contexts\*:

&gt; In Rebol and Red you can have any number of your own \*\*contexts\**

You have to explain what is a \*\*context\*\*. A context is just key-value container (dictionary/map/associative array) that's immutable (you cannot add new keys but you can change values, correct me if I'm wrong). So in the end you have to use map-like term.

9214

[10:53](#msg5b9a41babe4f300626899008)Context is anything but just a key-value container. You throwed away symbol IDs that words possess and symbol table itself.

nedzadarek

[11:33](#msg5b9a4aed1ee2ca65020deec5)@9214 thank you.  
From your image: So symbol table (context) is a key-value container. A word is a symbol and a pointer to a context. Right?  
So what we threw away was, more or less, implementation/irrelevant (in my opinion) detail(s).  
My point is: should the user/beginner knows about such details? Are they important - would they cause problems without knowing them?

9214

[11:46](#msg5b9a4e007dca306503f52f6c)No, symbol table is not a context, and not a key-value container. It's a series of symbol cells. Context is a combination of two series: series of symbol IDs (indexes in symbol table) and series of values. Word is a combination of symbol ID, a pointer to a context (thru node) and an index of a context entry.

&gt; should the user/beginner knows about such details?

It is my believe that they should, if they want to move away from being beginners. But then again, some are totally okay with using only 30% of what is given, and utilize Red as yet-another scripting language.

&gt; Are they important - would they cause problems without knowing them?

From my experience, most (if not all) newcomer's question and confusions stem from lack of knowledge and understanding of these "irrelevant" subleties. Community then only adds an insult to injury by obscuring all the details behind "oh no Red is easy, see, you shouldn't know all of that to use it".

9214

[11:57](#msg5b9a50b2f4bd1056ac585c15)The only thing that can change is a number of symbol tables. Currently it's one per session, and in the future it will be one per module.

I can't care less. But hiding all of these fundamentals and refusing to give them to newcomers because "oh it's so complex (it's not) and scary (no, it's beautiful), let's pretend that it's something what it's not" is a double game.

[12:14](#msg5b9a5498b9531f2dfa5eb281)Cells won't go anywhere, words/context indirect relationship won't go anywhere, how symbol lookup and nodes with buffers work won't change either, though, all of that might be optimized (e.g. increase cell size to support 64-bit, or support of UTF-8 caching). This is the crux of execution model.

nedzadarek

[12:21](#msg5b9a5666f7e1580625c5a1ef)@9214 it's not that I don't understand it. I find it pretty straightforward (aka beautiful). I've been playing with the red for so long but I haven't written code where I need to know `red-context!` is based on `symbols` with IDs and `values`.

Not everyone needs to use a language fully, let's be clear on that. Most won't. Just like most people use &lt;N% of features in Word or Excel. That said, you're right, if you only want programmers writing tools for other programmers, and trying to impress them. That's not our goal with Red.

And \*should* we treat every newcomer \*as if* he doesn't want to be a mechanic?

[23:40](#msg5b9af5518909f71f75cdc904)No offense, but your "we want Red to be the next-gen VB" doesn't resonate with me at all.

[23:40](#msg5b9af57fd655361f76f72ffc)Envisioned Red 2.0 is anything but VB, in my point of view, and more of a power-user thing, in the vein of Carl's "Rebol is not for everyone" blog post.

[07:25](#msg5b9b625abe4f300626907717)&gt; I encourage everyone here to answer the following questions...

&gt; 1) Do you consider yourself a programmer?

Nowadays, thanks to Red, I'm starting to consider myself somewhat of a programmer, although without proper basic training, discovering thing while going on. I used to program occasionally, tinkering with different langs, as a hobby, and did more of SQL on my work.

&gt; 2) Do you consider yourself a software engineer?

Not really. May be an application developer on a nanoscopic scale, if some of my Red-projects would count as applications.

&gt; 3) Do you solve business problems with software?

Not yet :) (Well, I used to, with SQL)

&gt; 4) What kind of problems do you solve?

Trying to build some little graphical apps which might be useful for beginners to start off.

&gt; 5) What other languages have you used?

SQL, PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bash, Python, REBOL, Mozart, Clips, OWL, SPARQL in diminishing order, some of these years ago, some more recently.

&gt; 6) What is your favorite language, and why?

Red. Need I specify why? :)

&gt; 7) Is "progammer" or "developer" in your job title?

I don't have job title. But if I had I think it would.

&gt; 8) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?

In a way, yes. Even if they may be interested in (or need only) some high-level DSL, which would be a special purpose dialect of Red. Others may need to build simple applications with Red proper, still others will delve deeper into Red philosopy and try to master all it's aspects, some again developing on system level. Hey, Red is fullstack after all, dare we say it is fullstack in its users range also?

&gt; 9) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?

Both.

&gt; 10) What software do you pay for?

Windows (not personally), some graphics apps, anti-virus, domain/virtual machine provider.

[10:58](#msg5b9b9440a56b215c97380f0b)Thanks for your info. @9214

9214

[10:58](#msg5b9b9455b4990c30eeb3c57a)@WayneCui writing down ANTLR features that you would like to see in Red would be 100% useful :+1:

WayneCui

[10:59](#msg5b9b9492f08bc22dfb5697c9)Yeah, PARSE is cool thing, should be known by more people.

9214

[10:59](#msg5b9b94aebe4f30062691b874)As an idea for side project: consider to write a tool that converts ANTLR rules to Parse rules, I believe they have tons of useful grammars which we can leverage.

WayneCui

[11:06](#msg5b9b963b7dca306503fcf3b9)My idea is writing a PARSE dialect for Java , just like RegExp, so Java people could use it ;-)

[11:08](#msg5b9b96980cfe7f30f1923f1a)May be a huge project for me right now. Just thought it.

9214

[11:09](#msg5b9b96e5b9531f2dfa664b0a)@WayneCui bear in mind that regular expressions and Parse are completely different beasts. The former can only recognize regular languages, while the latter can handle context-free ones. To put it simply, Parse (and any other CF grammar) can support self-embedding and nesting constructs, while for regexps the upper ceiling is a repetition.

[11:09](#msg5b9b96fcbe4f30062691c6a2)Regexes are used in lexers though, to recognize tokens.

[11:10](#msg5b9b973854587954f99f95f8)And, ANTLR is a parser generator that generates a parser in a target language (e.g. Java or C++), while Parse is a parsing engine written in Red/System.

WayneCui

[11:14](#msg5b9b9817b4990c30eeb3dd0f)Em, sounds complicated. I thought it would be easy ...

9214

[11:15](#msg5b9b9842a56b215c97382d59)And Parse is not only about string parsing and recognizing, it is also a major metaprogramming tool, closely tied to Red datatypes and structure.

[11:16](#msg5b9b9878fcba1254fab4c170)@WayneCui nay, you can learn all of that in one evening, nothing scary at all. Just pick something interesting that you're passionate about, and start small :wink:

1\) Do you consider yourself a programmer?  
Not really, I bought some C programming book before 15 years but i didnt read / practice more than 50 pages. Then i tried Macromedia Flash and did one small game in Flash 5. I tried some lua, html/css etc.. But my first real experience is three years ago when I got a job as a Business Intelligence / ETL developer.  
2\) Do you consider yourself a software engineer?  
Not really....  
3\) Do you solve business problems with software?  
Yes, I work for big automobile company and I am doing BI.  
4\) What kind of problems do you solve?  
Data processing -&gt; Data visualization  
5\) What other languages have you used?  
In my job? My colleagues use Talend for Java generated code. I hate code generators so I learnt Clojure and this is my secret weapon for now because we use JVM.  
6\) What is your favorite language, and why?  
Hard to say... RIght now I am enjoying learning Julia because it is complete and somewhat hybrid of Python and LISP. I love RED but it is not done yet. And I love Clojure but I dont like / know JVM. Lets say LISP family :-).  
7\) Is "progammer" or "developer" in your job title?  
Yeah..  
8\) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?  
I dont see any reason why it shouldnt, i would develop at least two internal tools for our team if there was a POSTGRESQL driver and IO done. But to be honest, languages like GO, Python or VBS are better for anyone who is not interested in programming languages :-).  
9\) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?  
For team tools and some fun.  
10\) What software do you pay for?  
For a lot of audio software and IntelliJ Idea..&gt;

7\) Is "progammer" or "developer" in your job title?  
Yes.

8\) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?  
Yes, we should not say (only) "Red is for everyone", but anyone (even non-programmer) can use it and can solve their problems or produce relatively small but useful programs.

What does this mean ? Should it be too difficult for some people to use ?  
There must be levels of complexity at which in can be used.  
Sure, some things can be more "difficult" or "advanced" than others, but a language should not be difficult to use. So, people with less knowledge should be able to use the features they need, without the more difficult stuff that they don't know coming back to bite them.

[10:47](#msg5b9ce354be4f3006269941ca)The important thing though is that the more advanced features are documented appropriately. There must be easily obtainable information, definitely reference, but hopefully the community produces tutorials, blogs etc as well. The advanced features can't be stuff that you need to be an "insider" to really understand or learn about. So long as the information is available, people who are interested can learn about it and use it. And, as mentioned before, the advanced features should not be causing you trouble if you don't know about them.

For fun until a stable, full featured version is released, then on to work  
10\) What software do you pay for?  
I tend to look for open source alternatives, can’t really remember the last time I paid to use software.

rebolek

[21:03](#msg5b9d73af1ee2ca65022066d7)  
No, but I pretend to be one

2\) Do you consider yourself a software engineer?  
Same as above

3\) Do you solve business problems with software?  
Yes

4\) What kind of problems do you solve?  
Problems introduced by those before me. Things are done, when there is nothing there to remove. There’s still lot to remove.

5\) What other languages have you used?  
ZX Spectrum Basic, Karel, Z80 ASM, Pascal, C, C++, Lua, Rebol, Bash, Red, Perl, JS, PHP

6\) What is your favorite language, and why?  
Rebol and Red. I’m Rebolek, JSbolek or dotnetbolek sounds stupid

7\) Is "progammer" or "developer" in your job title?  
Yes

8\) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?  
Is Visual Basic for everyone? I know lot of people who rather touch dead squirrel than VB. It might be, but if your target is everyone, you usually won’t satisfy no one.

9\) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?  
I use Red for both.

10\) What software do you pay for?  
Games and music software.&gt;

This is all very helpful information, and the VB for "everybody" idea was quoted because there will be a certain barrier to entry, even for tools like Squeak or Logo, you have to learn \*something\*.

endo64

[09:26](#msg5b9e21bb1ee2ca650223d687)"Red (Rebol) is for everyone" and "Anyone can use Red (Rebol) to program and solve problems" are two distinct things.  
Latter, can be done by anyone who have a basic understanding of how to program or anyone have good programming skills but no deeper understanding the design of Redbol, they can use Redbol just like they use Basic or C. In that sense Redbol doesn't give much advantage but it IS still useful and easy to learn &amp; use.  
We want programmers to better understand the design of Redbol, how different it is and why that difference is important. We should keep balance between these too points.

[07:36](#msg5b9f5980b9531f2dfa7aeb17)Last Week In Red

Tell us about yourself and what you'd like to see Red become! Here at https://gitter.im/red/red we have a few questions for you. They're also at the bottom of this message. Oh, and check the blog for a new report from @greggirwin: looks like @dockimbel &amp; @qtxie are in town!

Without further ado: More of your input and questions go into documentation! This exchange (https://gitter.im/red/help?at=5b9813e5728ddf02829371bc) prompted a further fleshing out of ways block elements can be accessed: (1) using slash and a numeric index; (2) treating the block as a key/value store (these in addition to originally defined comparative functions like `=, ==, <>, >, <, >=, <=, =?`).

We also saw a number of fixes to the RED Wallet, making it even more stable and flexible in response to data entries. Transactions that are waiting in the pending pool can be edited with greater clarity and simplicity; the wallet now lets you review the amount and address of your transactions.

In Red's Garbage Collection, following the previous week's fixes, new object recycling features were added, discrete from series.

The community project red.specs-public -- a guide to the syntax and semantics governing the language -- added the option to search the repository by datatype.

In his nimble diagramming tool, user @toomasv continues to expand its interactive capabilities, adding a layer for re-sizing of diagram data and further defining shapes.

And here are your questions, please answer them here:  
https://gitter.im/red/red?at=5b9af21854587954f99bd32d

1\) Do you consider yourself a programmer?  
2\) Do you consider yourself a software engineer?  
3\) Do you solve business problems with software?  
4\) What kind of problems do you solve?  
5\) What other languages have you used?  
6\) What is your favorite language, and why?  
7\) Is "progammer" or "developer" in your job title?  
8\) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?  
9\) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?  
10\) What software do you pay for?

We've seen a lot of great responses so far, which tell us about how people are using Red, and who they are, which will help us prioritize features. Keep 'em coming, and Happy Reducing!

[15:58](#msg5b9fcf381ee2ca65022d48fa)1) Do you consider yourself a programmer?  
No. Hobbyist/experimenter would be closer.

2\) Do you consider yourself a software engineer?  
Definitely not.

3\) Do you solve business problems with software?  
Yes. I use Filemaker at work (is that even programming ? ;-)

4\) What kind of problems do you solve?  
I have a variety of personal projects. In one project, I’m currently learning FORTH to program a micro controller to control a servo and various other external devices.  
I’m planning out several network aware CRUD apps for personal use (I want to use RED for these).  
I am also planning to rewrite some inherited python code using Red. This code, as it is, has severe cross platform problems and the GUI is very crash prone (using Kivy)

5\) What other languages have you used?  
I have tinkered with:  
C, Pascal, Basic, Applescript, Z80 asm, 6502 asm, Squeak, Logo, FORTH

6\) What is your favorite language, and why?  
I don’t have a favourite language. I would need to be more proficient in at least 2 before I claimed a favourite.  
However, a favourite would be a language that made my life easier and would have at least these features:  
\-Cross-platform  
\-Reliable, built-in and well supported GUI functionality  
\-Simple and Accessible toolset  
\-Many built-in features that eliminate the need for external libraries

7\) Is "progammer" or "developer" in your job title?  
No

8\) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?  
YES !!! It’s simplified toolset qualifies it for that already!

9\) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?  
There’s a difference ?!?  
…but seriously now. Both. I see Red as being a Tool for creation, while other languages/environments are so overly complex, there’s no point in learning them unless you will be paid well for the effort.

10\) What software do you pay for?  
Image editing, web development, 3D modelling, database

Yes.

&gt; 2) Do you consider yourself a software engineer?

No, but I probably am according the Wikipedia's specification.. don't have any degree in this area.

&gt; 3) Do you solve business problems with software?

Yes.

&gt; 4) What kind of problems do you solve?

Building games, maintaining games. Was doying webs and multimedia apps years ago.

&gt; 5) What other languages have you used?

REBOL, C, C++, ObjectiveC, Java, JavaScript, ActionScript, Haxe, Python, ASP, PHP, SQL, XML, HTML (and some which I don't remember anymore, like Pascal)

&gt; 6) What is your favorite language, and why?

Probably REBOL as it's language, which I use every day almost since its beginning. But I use it mainly like a tool with cooperation with other languages.

&gt; 7) Is "progammer" or "developer" in your job title?

Yes.

&gt; 8) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?

Maybe it \_could_ be for "everyone", but I don't have strong opinion on that. Probably it would be better not to try to please everybody from beginning.

&gt; 9) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?

I would like to see Red to be mature enough for real work (I used it for real just as a simple GUI for a command line tool). It is always good to have fun while doying real work.

&gt; 10) What software do you pay for?

Adobe CC, SmartGit, SublimeText3

[03:16](#msg5ba06dff1ee2ca650230d160)&gt; 3) Do you solve business problems with software?  
&gt; 4) What kind of problems do you solve?

there is no software can handle my problems. So I have to write my own

The first application is actually a database, the difficult part lies in  
1\. reading and writing Excel(xls and xlsx) and Word(doc and docx) files  
2\. write result into word file according to template

the second one is about digital image/computer graphics research

till now, I use python + numpy/scipy + pandas + pycuda + nimba. pytorch is planned too

&gt; 5) What other languages have you used?

mainly python, sometimes C/cython for speed reason.  
I am learning nim too.

&gt; 6) What is your favorite language, and why?

python, because it has tons of libraries, some of which are time-proven, some are in active development.  
As for the the concise syntax part, I thought python has. But after I found nim, I think neither python or nim has concise syntax as I expected in some detail implements.

&gt; 8) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?

"program for everyone" is a stupid slogan

&gt; 9) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?

I am waiting for:

1\. libraries to deal with more aspects  
2\. no virus warning. No I am not mean "tell the user make your application in antivirus application's whitelist"

&gt; 10) What software do you pay for?

I don't understand why there is such a question. Does it mean RED will opensource the core but charge for the library or advanced functions?

P.S. why there is such a low-level survey after tooo years of development? Does RED lost its direction? Does RED find "full stack" is an impossible ambition?

P.S. sorry for the some impolite comment if someone think he is hurt.

[07:02](#msg5ba0a2e8e5c2cc56ada725e6)&gt; I don't understand why there is such a question. Does it mean RED will opensource the core but charge for the library or advanced functions?

@retsyo, we think we already know the answer to this, but we also don't want to assume too much. We have to make Red sustainable, long term. Do you understand that? Knowing what current Red users pay for can give us clues about how to do that.

&gt; P.S. why there is such a low-level survey after tooo years of development? Does RED lost its direction? Does RED find "full stack" is an impossible ambition?

If you followed the chat here, you saw that this "survey" was just some questions in a message, in response to other chat. Please don't read too much into it. It's already been very helpful to me though. I've learned a lot about some of our community members.

&gt; "program for everyone" is a stupid slogan

Yeah, that's pretty impolite, without including any further explanation.

[11:25](#msg5ba2322f5df5194734e08bc9)OK, well, it's nice to read everyone's responses anyway, so assuming that is what is wanted, here is mine:

[11:25](#msg5ba23236fcba1254fadb160a)1) Do you consider yourself a programmer?

Yes.

2\) Do you consider yourself a software engineer?

I am not sure what the official definition of that term is (if there is one) but it sure sounds good on a CV, so I'm going with "yes" :-)

3\) Do you solve business problems with software?

Absolutely.

4\) What kind of problems do you solve?

Development and enhancement of business applications and shuttling data to and fro :-)

5\) What other languages have you used?

Mainly ABAP (SAP SE's proprietary software development language/platform/environment) and Ruby, but I dabble frequently in other languages and so have some general ideas about functional languages as well as things like Smalltalk, Forth, etc. Oh yes, and Javascript because, like, who hasn't, amirite? :-)

6\) What is your favorite language, and why?

1\. Ruby, due to its poetic beauty.  
2\. ABAP, because, though the language is perhaps clunky, I'm a big fan of the idea of a business application platform as a self-contained entity. (In some conceptual ways like a Smalltalk environment, but in the form of an application server with built-in software development (and software logistics) capabilities). I'm hoping that one day Red can be used to build such a platform.

7\) Is "progammer" or "developer" in your job title?

Yes.

8\) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?

It's a difficult proposal, but it should at least provide everyone who wants to solve a problem using programming the easiest way to do so (in the spirit of Rebol, I guess) and, by that, I mean that programming should not require you to have to install some big-ass piece of software with loads of dependencies just to get something up and running. In addition, writing code should be straightforward and fun and not be encumbered with rigid paradigms and frameworks and hidden nuances.

9\) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?

Both.

10\) What software do you pay for?

At present, Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office. In the past I have shelled out money for IDE products and contributed money to some open source projects.

1\) Do you consider yourself a programmer?  
Yes.

2\) Do you consider yourself a software engineer?  
Not these days.

3\) Do you solve business problems with software?  
Yes.

4\) What kind of problems do you solve?  
Data cleansing, analysis and integrations.

5\) What other languages have you used?  
BASIC, C, Java, Python

6\) What is your favorite language, and why?  
Python.

7\) Is "progammer" or "developer" in your job title?  
No.

8\) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?  
Agree with Martin Ceronio. I think any language should be approachable yet capable to solve almost any problem, so in this way Red should be for everyone.

9\) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?  
Both. I was using it for my previous work until I had to abandon it due to lack of garbage collection. When the new version comes out, I'd like to try it again.

10\) What software do you pay for?  
MS Office, Dash, Sublime Text, various utilities (I'll pay for any useful productivity enhancement for the time saving - it's worth it), I've supported other programs via BountySource.

Thanks for all your efforts on Red - cheers.

[22:21](#msg5ba2cbdae6046343f388e6eb) A couple notes regarding this Monday's weekly update. First, @meijeru observed that in our update regarding his work in meijeru/red.specs-public, our language needed to be more precise when describing his recent discovery: that he did not so much "add the option" to search by datatype, as he discovered that this facility had already existed, but was unknown to most. My use of "repository" had been a stretch -- you can search a block or data structure by datatype, but not a repository.

Also lost in translation (so to speak) was my reference to "comparative functions like `=, ==, <>, >, <, >=, <=, =?.`" In posting my update regarding these standard comparative functions, at some point `<=` became `<=`. Thank you to @9214 for noticing.

You may also notice sometimes hyperlinks are not active; this is because I am (very appropriately, at this stage) not posting the updates directly on the blog, myself; I furnish the text to those with direct editing permissions, and they are very busy people, and sometimes hyperlinks don't get connected.

Please bear with us as we get these issues worked out. We are mining the vein of progress, with perfection as our Platonic ideal. As always I welcome your kind and well-intentioned efforts to correct what errors are made, as this helps improve my understanding of the work as a whole.

[23:29](#msg5ba2dbbef7e1580625f77322)Ahh, okay. So it's saying that for the `find` function, in addition to being able to search a series for a specific value, you can \_also_ search for a value type. Good to know. Thanks! Worth opening an issue to add that information to the docstring for the `find` `value` argument?

[00:05](#msg5ba2e464f4bd1056ac8a9f60)Since the spec already uses `any-type!`, it's a tough call. Typesets are the odd man out right now, but we should confirm the behavior for types so we can formulate the best doc string.

Ungaretti

[12:17](#msg5ba38fc5913ba7799b1a45d0)1) Do you consider yourself a programmer?  
No. I have been involved in many projects that require lots of software, but did very little programming myself.  
2\) Do you consider yourself a software engineer?  
No.  
3\) Do you solve business problems with software?  
Yes.  
4\) What kind of problems do you solve?  
Office automation, hardware projects, IoTprojects, creating "quick and dirty" solutions for prototyping and testing ideas.  
5\) What other languages have you used?  
I have used many, but can't say I even remember most. Basic, Fortran, Pascal. I once even did a 4K program in assembly for a microprocessor. Recently I only use C++ (Arduino) and, until I found Redbol, I used Processing for desktop apps. I have used some Lua on ESP8266, and I really like it.  
6\) What is your favorite language, and why?  
Well, since I'm not a professional programmer, I'll pass this question. But I have a soft spot in my heart for Redbol because of it's small, it compiles to executables, and has an easy GUI. I like Lua too, but making GUIs for lua is not half as easy. GUIs are essential if you want to other people to use your programs.  
7\) Is "progammer" or "developer" in your job title?  
No.  
8\) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?  
I don't understand this question. Is it even possible to radically change Red from what it is now? To make a two-part Red, like Rebol has the free (everyone) and paid (professional) parts? Wasn't that one of the reasons Rebol failed?  
9\) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?  
Both.  
10\) What software do you pay for?  
Windows comes installed on my computers. I usually buy programs that I like and are in the 0-100 dollars range, although I have sometimes paid much more. I NEVER buy licences that you pay on a monthly or yearly basis.

[12:50](#msg5ba4e9220cfe7f30f1c90931)Time for me to provide my data:  
1\) Do you consider yourself a programmer?  
Yes. I started programming in 1987.  
2\) Do you consider yourself a software engineer?  
Yes.  
3\) Do you solve business problems with software?  
Yes.  
4\) What kind of problems do you solve?  
System-/Hardware related (kernel, OS, drivers); financial sector (trading systems, indicators, charting, back-end/front-end); video games; security/penetration testing/RE  
5\) What other languages have you used?  
Too many to list, so just the more used ones: Assembler, BASIC, COBOL, C, C++, C#, Java, Oberon-2, ... and various scripting languages (PHP, LUA, AngelScript, python, shell scripts,....)  
6\) What is your favorite language, and why?  
I like to use C and C++ because they are close to the metal and my work needs a high-performance code. Assembler is also on my top-list because there are no limitations and you learn how a computer works. I like Red because it allows me to code close to the metal as well as on a more higher level. It's also more fun and productive to code in Red and Red/System.  
7\) Is "progammer" or "developer" in your job title?  
Yes.  
8\) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?  
Absolutely. Red offers various abstraction levels so that it can be used by every programmer regardless of his knowledge level. There is no need to use different languages for different tasks because Red can cover them all. No bloated SDKs to install, easy to manage and to set up.  
9\) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?  
Both.  
10\) What software do you pay for?  
I'm a strong advocate of Open Source software, so I try to use that if I can and buying software, I need to use for work like software for design, publishing, music creation compilers/run-times/engines and CAD/CAM. Besides that, I pay for non-free Operating Systems and of course Games.

moliad

[12:54](#msg5ba4ea0e913ba7799b226e3a)@BeardPower have you published your steps on creating a new datatype yet? I'm in the process of doing it and have already done 4 things, but it crashes on the make, (type is recognised, created, runs through the accessor, but crashes just after...) . any clues?

BeardPower

[12:55](#msg5ba4ea5ce5c2cc56adc18360)@moliad Not yet, as I'm finishing up the money! type over the weekend. I will also polish/finish the tutorial on implementing a new data-type.

[12:57](#msg5ba4ead40cfe7f30f1c9145c)Hard to tell without any code. Did you implement the form and mold actions? Returning a copy and not a local instance? Declared memory for a red type?

[13:01](#msg5ba4eba7e5c2cc56adc18ace)my team and I are working on Red and have built a few charts with graphical details about some internal structures, and the parse state machine change graph, which we'll be sharing in the near future.

[13:10](#msg5ba4edb3913ba7799b228705)'r you from the Rebol community of the past?

BeardPower

[13:11](#msg5ba4ee167dca306503338ec9)No, I never used/heard of Rebol before. I joined Red as I read about it on a Reddit discussion about new languages (Nim and Pony).

[13:14](#msg5ba4eebf913ba7799b228ea4)Code protection would be great. At least against some script-kiddies. You cannot really secure client-side code from skilled people anyway, just make it harder and more time-consuming.

[13:15](#msg5ba4eef1f4bd1056ac96d852)Code protection also creates a lot of false positives because the AV vendors run sum shitty dynamic analysis.

moliad

[13:19](#msg5ba4efc5be4f300626c8b7f7)I want to prevent code within the modules to be able to affect code outside the modules and vice-versa. basically, the internals of the interpreter/compiler wouldn't be able to bind to the words accross the module boundary... in both ways. the exception would be for words you specifically allow at library load time (which should occur before all user code). there are limits on what can and can't be done, but at least to protect un-intentional binding mistakes. slim in Rebol already does a pretty good job of it (but it can be easily defeated if you really try).

BeardPower

[13:19](#msg5ba4efef0cfe7f30f1c93424)Ah, I thought you were talking about anti-debugging/anti-RE features.

moliad

[13:20](#msg5ba4f0258909f71f7508c5be)We are looking into the Red code on modules to see what's there already and how/what/if we need to improve it . Slim comes with a slew of other features like resource management, per module switchable traces, and more.

[13:21](#msg5ba4f05b1043315947c49522)we'll also try to make it so the same module code can work in both Red and Rebol2 when possible, to make the transition of our huge code base less painful.

[13:21](#msg5ba4f076e5c2cc56adc1a6db)we have 10 years of code to transition to Red, so its a pretty big job.

[13:22](#msg5ba4f097f7e158062503d3fb)anti-debugging/anti-RE could be a nice thing for a pro edition.\\

BeardPower

[13:22](#msg5ba4f09cf4bd1056ac96e3d6)Red does not have modules yet and the compiler is not able to generate static libs, archives or objects.

moliad

[13:23](#msg5ba4f0da33da0f649e318180)doesn't it support the 'needs: parameter in the header... maybe it just does an include with not much more features to it?

BeardPower

[13:23](#msg5ba4f0dd5df5194734f163c0)But you can output executables and do some linker magic to link them together.

moliad

[13:24](#msg5ba4f0f2b9531f2dfa9d6392)Red can output dlls... we've done it already :-)

BeardPower

[13:25](#msg5ba4f12fe5c2cc56adc1ab89)Yes, dynamic libs are fine for the supported run-times. Not so much if you created a new OS for which you have to create the run-time first.

[13:26](#msg5ba4f1a25df5194734f1683d)I'm still looking for a fully automated tool which can interface Red with C++.

[13:28](#msg5ba4f1e4f4bd1056ac96ebc4)https://github.com/dropbox/djinni eases a little of the pain.

moliad

[13:28](#msg5ba4f1f67dca30650333a9ea)technically possible... I've worked on one for a few weeks last year... BUT the issue is that C++ has no standard ABI, so all compilers can output shit differently.

BeardPower

[13:29](#msg5ba4f2381ee2ca65024c65ab)A C wrapper works quite well if your C++ code does not use exceptions, fancy templates or function overloading.

I have an alternative implementation in R2, using liquid, my dataflow engine which does complete graph based rendering management, with output targeting AGG, but that could be easily replaced. the main advantage is that it has graphic elements with arbitrary layers. so the same shape can generate multiple versions of itself using the same coordinates and graphic details, and you can choose which one you want and even render them in succession, so you can have a bg, shadow, main and highlight layers, all independent. I use it to generate a shape location map allowing us to have arbitrary shapes in hit location.... just like in opengl. all rendered in real time by Rebol 2.

[20:59](#msg5ba55ba55df5194734f402c9)@moliad, after some chat here, our recommendation is that you move forward and build what you need. We'll have to align later and see what works from the inside out. Things to consider:

\- Incremental module compilation. i.e. only recompile a module if the source changes.  
\- Linking static modules, in addition to dynamic loading.  
\- Each module \*may* have its own symbol table.  
\- Package management system.

[05:53](#msg5ba5d8ee8909f71f750df4b9)&gt; 1) Do you consider yourself a programmer?

yes  
&gt; 2) Do you consider yourself a software engineer?

I'm not convinced that software development is engineering, but I do like design  
&gt; 3) Do you solve business problems with software?

yes  
&gt; 4) What kind of problems do you solve?

automation of video production workflows (lots of plumbing), installers, build automation, trying not to be overtaken by complexity (yes, I think that is a real problem that needs to be solved)  
&gt; 5) What other languages have you used?

Java, Pascal, C, C#, Lisp, Python, Javascript, Powershell, SQL, XSL, \[Human Resource Machine](https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine)  
&gt; 6) What is your favorite language, and why?

Red! It's so beautiful and elegant, simple and powerful. I still like C# actually, but learning Red has made me a better C# programmer too.  
&gt; 7) Is "progammer" or "developer" in your job title?

no, but "software engineer" actually is  
&gt; 8) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?

I think it's like "Anyone can cook" from Ratatouille - \_Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist \*can* come from \*anywhere\*\_. I think that temperament has something to do with it. I would hate to see Red dumbed down in any way to draw in more users, but I think that if it continues to strive for goals like simplicity, clarity, power... those all broaden the kind of audience that it would appeal to.  
&gt; 9) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?

both  
&gt; 10) What software do you pay for?

OS, games, dev tools (I don't, but my company does)

Creating a reporting engine, maintaining data integrations, building, maintaining, and expanding websites.

5\) What other languages have you used?  
C#, F#, javascript, Typescript, SQL, C++

6\) What is your favorite language, and why?  
C#, but only because I can do whatever I need to easily. I would prefer a more advanced language like F# or Red if I could fully grasp the finer details. The difference between intermediate and expert in these languages is an ocean's distance. So many subtle features are under-documented with overly trivial examples that don't encourage experimentation. So many features either make reference to either a math course I never took or another programming language, e.g. if you took the time to learn that other language then this feature will feel right at home for you, so we won't document it very much because we assume you already know it. That kind of logic does piss me off. Red system is a great example, It assumes I already know operating system specific things. At the system level you have to know OS specific stuff to do anything. Nothing in Red System's documentation teaches this. Document all of your language features as if this was the person's first programming language! Make it easier for me to cross those oceans, and I would gladly have Red as my main go to language for any desktop or data oriented project. Add some web dev features and I would use it for anything.

7\) Is "programmer" or "developer" in your job title?  
Yes

8\) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?  
If you can do it in a way that doesn't compromise advanced features, then yes. But really its a great language, if you can stay great and find ways to attract more people, that would be ideal.

9\) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?  
Right now I use it for fun. I have also used it just a bit for UI prototyping . If I actually owned my own company, then maybe for work.

10\) What software do you pay for?  
Graphics generation software (Spiral Graphics Genetica and other seamless texture generation tools), music creation software, workflow software, games, IDE's, productivity tools, caching tools, and cloud infrastructure and management tools.

[00:05](#msg5ba6d8c9b9531f2dfaa7f45b)@AlexanderBaggett bring up a point I'm curious about: "Document all of your language features as if this was the person's first programming language!" Would this be helpful to many people? Is Red an appropriate point of entry for those seeking to learn their first language? For someone who has never learned OS-specific things, will learning Red System be useful? Did most language learners--of any programming language--enter the field by needing to use it for OSs? If it were me learning a language for the first time, I'd want the language to do simple, concrete things like make a simple notepad app for my phone, or a silly graphics editor like Paint. Because that's a great start for a beginner to visualize and understand. Eventually, as my repertoire expanded, I'd need to get closer to system level, to make the more advanced and specific specs a reality, or as I started to need to program tools that managed my more beginner-level programs.

[00:07](#msg5ba6d949b9531f2dfaa7f7b0)On the other hand, I'm a huge fan of highly specific and multimedia instruction that doesn't assume the learner's level of ability.

AlexanderBaggett

[02:07](#msg5ba6f54733da0f649e3cd038)To you first question, I feel it would. The fewer the assumptions you make about a language learner's ability the better. I would like to turn your second question on it's head. I feel with the right documentation Red could be someone's first language. But it depends on how you document and market it, and if that is a direction you guys want to take this language. But you are in a position where it could be a good first programming language depending on how you approach it. @lucindamichele , I already know the high-level stuff, (as-in Red itself) and other languages like C# and so on. But let's say I wanted to learn some system level programming with Red via Red System. I would have to look at both Red System's documentation, and maybe some C++ books/documentation that target specific OS's. That's not fun. If Red System is next the language for system's programming why should I be reading documentation written for other programming languages to figure out what I need to do? At the very least it would be helpful for links to OS specific API documentation even if it's documented for C++ readers.

BuilderGuy1

[20:11](#msg5ba7f363f4bd1056aca78e94)@BeardPower I find your project VERY exciting !!! I've been dissatisfied with "modern" computing for quite some time. It's become painfully obvious that Walled Gardens and Spy Platforms are being handed off as "modern computing". I have been researching the computing innovations from the 90's b/c that's the last time innovation has really happened in this industry. I'm specifically interested in Document Centric computing. App centric computing, in my opinion, is inside-out. When the data (document) becomes the focus, the entire system becomes simpler, smaller and easier to secure. This kind of system also becomes a computing playground rather than silos of functionality and data. As part of my explorations, I have thought of Red. It has many of the essential pieces required for such a system already built-in. Unfortunately I'm not even close to having the skills to implement such a thing... I look forward to reading your blog :-)

BeardPower

[20:14](#msg5ba7f442e6046343f3a6862e)@BuilderGuy1  
Absolutely. We stick with soft- and hardware which was invented 30years ago. It's an experiment on how R/S can be used for creating a Kernel/OS from scratch and trying out new ideas invented in the last years but did not get much out of the academic field.

The basic thing to know is that the GC is on by default, so the \*\*unreferenced\** values will be collected on next GC pass (notice the emphasis on \_unreferenced_ as it is a key part of understanding how allocated memory can be reclaimed). The memory allocations are series-oriented and not value-oriented.

[23:01](#msg5ba96ce27bd81c5b9daad108)@dockimbel as a rule of thumb, anything that is not refered by some word or does not reside in some series is an unreferenced value? (technically it is only about values residing in series).

[22:08](#msg5baab1d456877c463a8364d1)Hello (again) world! Our Weekly Recap  
(Cool announcement buried below, like a prize in cereal.)

1\. A goodly part of our Fellowship of Red Magicians ("rogues" would be more  
alliterative, but I don't think they qualify as rogues) are cloistered in the wilds  
of Idaho, casting spells and muttering arcana over Red with yet more far-flung  
fellows. Right now, @dockimbel, @qxtie, @PeterWAWood and @greggirwin are  
working magic on Garbage Collection, which has now been merged into the  
master branch. Debugging was a big challenge, and writing tests equally so.  
There are many subtle details that may not be intuitive, like the fact that  
series values don't shrink when items are removed. As you use the GC version,  
don't be too hasty to file bug reports. Confirm via community chat that you  
understand the expected behavior.

2\. In red/docs, we're fleshing out our translations and adding more  
documentation of datatypes. In  
https://github.com/meijeru/red.specs-public/blob/master/specs.adoc#12-exceptions,  
@meijeru has expanded his discussion of the existing repertoire of errors  
to include ways the user can define errors for themselves. Meanwhile,  
@tovim's latest Czech translations have been added (https://github.com/red/docs/commit/89a5e65134ec706064f0b68b27e1886318fe6888,  
https://github.com/red/docs/commit/e2acfa8b7e9682232770438758d065bbbcfe69af)

and new descriptions of datatypes from @gltewalt have been placed here:  
https://doc.red-lang.org/en/datatypes.html.

3\. Your prize for reading down: We'll be at the Ethereum Devcon! See you in  
Prague, October 30 - November 2! I'm putting it out there now, that in Prague the Rainbow Unicorn Halloween costumes will prolly be SOLD. OUT. Tickets were hard to come by, each wave  
selling out in less than a minute. We're excited to talk to core devs and  
tell them about Red/C3.

4\. Regarding Issues, if you notice reproducible issues, please document them as  
thoroughly as possible on github. New issue #3541 was handled promptly by  
@dockimbel. #3536 observed that when 'make hash!' was applied to a value  
of which there were a very large number of looped interations, Red revs up the  
CPU usage and grinds away for quite a while before producing a result, so we've  
reviewed it and added it as a bug. Of interest also is #3530, in which @dsunanda  
observed some laggy movement when setting a panel as loose.

5\. Answer our questions for the community, before it's too late! Go here:

[06:16](#msg5bab243798245f4ae0855cd1)@Sprinting why are you still using grunt whereas nearly everybody has switched to gulp ;) now as for using red for these kind of task, I agree, for me that's one of real viable use case for red. For other use cases it's not mature.

[06:27](#msg5bab26d698245f4ae0856ae0)@AlexanderBaggett "Document all of your language features as if this was the person's first programming language! Make it easier for me to cross those oceans, and I would gladly have Red as my main go to language for any desktop or data oriented project. Add some web dev features and I would use it for anything."  
The features are very few and "documented" from the viewpoint of core insiders. So no much internals are actually explained you have to guess or plunge into red source code. That's not different and typical of most if not all opensource projects but as communities are huger in these projects some people share the internals. That's the problem with red: you'll progress fast then you feel like a barrier you can't pass because you don't the profound knowledge of how things really works.

[07:27](#msg5bab34fa8ddf5867dc760e24)1) Do you consider yourself a programmer?  
A hobbyist programmer  
2\) Do you consider yourself a software engineer?  
No  
3\) Do you solve business problems with software?  
Yes  
4\) What kind of problems do you solve?  
Small utility programs to extract/format data from .csv files; simple OCR (written from scratch, reading .jpg-s from a multipage .pdf file and splitting the .pdf info individual files according to the recognized personal ID)  
5\) What other languages have you used?  
x86 assembly language, C, Python, J. Currently slowly learning Red, Racket and APL.  
6\) What is your favorite language, and why?  
I don’t have one, I’m still in search for it. I’m currently broadening my knowledge of the programming languages with a hope to choose a language that suits me the most.  
7\) Is "progammer" or "developer" in your job title?  
No  
8\) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?  
Yes, I think it should be for everyone, at least its basic subset (or a DSL for the purpose). I really like the ease of use of Red, which combined with the richness of datatypes and possibility for compilation to an .exe gives great opportunities to a great variety of programmers.  
9\) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?  
I want to use it for both. I’m currently using it for fun, solving Stack Exchange’s Programming Puzzles &amp; Code Golf challenges.  
10\) What software do you pay for?  
Mostly for puzzle/adventure games and drawing/painting software

[07:39](#msg5bab37aa01fb5f4ae124123e)Well, finally, here are my votes. (I chatted with Gregg before, because I think not all questions are very relevant)  
1\) Do you consider yourself a programmer?  
.. and more, really like to work with the customer.  
2\) Do you consider yourself a software engineer?  
.. but not a software architect.  
3\) Do you solve business problems with software?  
Yes  
4\) What kind of problems do you solve?  
Business administrative problems.  
5\) What other languages have you used?  
Almost feel easier answering What language not?  
Always learning new ones for the job when needed. BASIC, Pascal, COBOL in 4 flavours, VB6,  
Informix 4GL, Powerbuilder, Java, php, PL/SQL.  
6\) What is your favorite language, and why?  
REBOL(2). Because it is all-round. But it lacks features  
7\) Is "progammer" or "developer" in your job title?  
Most of the time it is, has been, yes.  
8\) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?  
Absolutely. Do not expect anything less for a fullstack language. There will be different levels of problem solving  
and skillsets will vary along with that, also expressions can be made unbelievably complicated and even elegant solutions that most people cannot grasp made.  
9\) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?  
For fun and for work with fun, but as it is my secret toolbox I can manage many tasks in fractions of the time others need.  
10\) What software do you pay for?  
Preinstalled operating systems on new computers. I paid for some games in the past, and for PaintShop pro.  
And MSOffice for Mac, needed compatiblity with work, and OpenOffice/LibreOffice is sooooo sloooooow, must be Java powered or something.  
Businesses pay for software. They pay big time and ICT companies sell bloatwaresolutions because they are quickly implemented, do not need much thinking, sell newer hardware to run the bloat on, do a lot of maintainance hours for upgrading bloatware.  
11\) What do you like Red to be able to do what it currently cannot?  
I would like to get full support for Linux/FreeBSD/Haiku so I can leave the well known closed source Operating systems behind me.

[11:13](#msg5bab69e556877c463a87d0d9)1) Do you consider yourself a programmer?  
Yes.  
2\) Do you consider yourself a software engineer?  
I was one, but mostly on mainframe systems software.  
3\) Do you solve business problems with software?  
Not anymore, but I did that a long time. But now as a hobby.  
4\) What kind of problems do you solve?  
Mostly small utilities and glue software.  
5\) What other languages have you used?  
Which language not?!  
6\) What is your favorite language, and why?  
Red, because it is a real Swiss knife and not bloated. Also I like 8th (8th-dev.com) a Forth derivative, but that is not open source and also PicoLisp.  
7\) Is "programmer" or "developer" in your job title?  
It was.  
8\) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?  
Yes, and I am convinced this will be so.  
I'd like to see Red more secure, so it can be used as replacement for Ada / Rust.  
9\) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?  
Fun first. But if I would have a brain wave, maybe it would be possible to sell an app some day :)  
10\) What software do you pay for?  
Windows, Office and a few others worth paying for.

3\) Yes  
4\) Thermodynamics, System Optimization, routing optimization, large data number crunching  
5\) C++, Matlab, Python

[00:48](#msg5bad7a49aedb375b9c59b9b2)1) Do you consider yourself a programmer?  
Yes I do.  
2\) Do you consider yourself a software engineer?  
I definitely love to architect my own software but I have not yet been given the opportunity to be professionally tested in this area.  
3\) Do you solve business problems with software?  
Yes I do.  
4\) What kind of problems do you solve?  
Automation of repetitive and manual tasks.  
5\) What other languages have you used?  
Python, Java, JavaScript, and C/C++  
6\) What is your favorite language, and why?  
So far, Python. It has by far the quickest return on investment and an utterly massive third party library ecosystem.  
7\) Is "programmer" or "developer" in your job title?  
Yes.  
8\) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?  
I think that it already is. It is far more simple to use than Python, and Red/System is an amazingly good idea. Just flesh out the docs and it'd be ready for mass consumption.  
9\) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?  
So far, just for fun, but would love to make use of Red/System for high performance software.  
10\) What software do you pay for?  
Windows and Affinity Designer. Affinity Designer happens to be better than InkScape and does not require a subscription like Adobe products. Yes, I would pay for Red if it meant better documentation for Red/System.

I am so excited to see what Red can become and would love to use Red + Red/System for game development.

[04:20](#msg5badac088196693171c7e0eb)1) Do you consider yourself a programmer?  
I am an amateur programmer.  
2\) Do you consider yourself a software engineer?  
No  
3\) Do you solve business problems with software?  
Yes.  
4\) What kind of problems do you solve?  
Data processing, Creating interfaces, MIS  
5\) What other languages have you used?  
BASIC, Clarion Professional 2.1, Visual Basic and MSSQL (solution architect for accounting package), MSAccess,  
VBA, C++, Autoit 3, Rebol, ABAP  
6\) What is your favorite language, and why?  
Rebol is favorite since it is simple and intuitive  
but it is not easy to create interfaces and do automation with it. Therefore I use Autoit and C++ for my personal programs. In course of my job, I use ABAP.  
7\) Is "progammer" or "developer" in your job title?  
No  
8\) Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?  
Yes. It should be full stack users. I would like to see a day when OS and development language, IDE and interpreter are in same language. A person opens command terminal and writes commands which are interpreted and executed.  
9\) Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?  
Both.  
10\) What software do you pay for?  
Windows OS indirectly and Amibroker (Stock Charting). I am willing to pay for RED if it becomes useful for interfacing and automation.

[06:37](#msg5badcc474d320a463b06d249)Maybe it has already been asked many times, but I'm curious whether there are plans for introducing some functional-style functions like map, filter, reduce/fold into Red? Now I use collect with foreach, keeping only the necessary items of a series.

dander

[07:09](#msg5badd39efe377811100cfb27)@GalenIvanov there are plans to do so eventually, but nothing solidified as far as I know. In the mean time, it's pretty easy to make your own. For example

```
>> map: function [series f][collect [foreach x series [keep f x]]]
== func [series f /local x][collect [foreach x series [keep f x]]]
>> map [1 2 3] func[x][2 * x]
== [2 4 6]
```

or maybe something like this...

```
>> map: function [series body][collect [foreach item series [keep do rejoin [body item]]]]
== func [series body /local item][collect [foreach item series [keep...
>> map [1 2 3] [2 *]

Just what my employer pays for. I don't think that "open source"  
should equal "free as in beer." I think it is totally reasonable  
to pay for something like REBOL/Red. There is a lot of work  
behind those products and money would keep them up to date.  
I think there is some unknown price point where people would be  
happy to pay. Someone, I think Adam Osborne, commented once that  
if software is inexpensive enough, people will buy lots of it.

[17:30](#msg5bae652bc7bf7c3662876e58)@GalenIvanov, Red will get a set of HOFs, and we know the basic plan, but need to think about the details to make sure the design works well. e.g. in FP, you pass funcs as args to HOFs, but in Red we like to use `body` blocks (e.g. with `*each` funcs). There are pros and cons each way, and things we want to Redify, rather than just copying past designs, while still learning from them. For example, `map` is dead simple, right? But what about something like this:

```
; JS-like MAP. The order of args to the function is a bit odd, but is set
; up that way because we always want at least the value (if your func takes
; only one arg), the next most useful arg is the index, as you may display
; progress, and the series is there to give you complete control and match
; how JS does it. Now, should the series value be passed as the head of the
; series, or the current index, using AT?
; This is *sort of* like map-indexed in Clojure.
map-js: func [
	"Evaluates a function for all values in a series and returns the results."
	series [series!]
	fn [any-function!] "Function to perform on each value; called with value, index, series, [? and size ?] args"
	;/only "Collect block types as single values"
	;/skip "Treat the series as fixed size records"
	;	size [integer!]
][
	collect [
		repeat i length? series [   ; use FORSKIP if we want to support /SKIP.
			keep/only fn series/:i :i :series ;:size
		]
	]
]
res: map-js [1 2 3 a b c #d #e #f] :form
res: map-js [1 2 3 a b c #d #e #f] func [v i] [reduce [i v]]
res: map-js [1 2 3 a b c #d #e #f] func [v i s] [reduce [i v s]]
res: map-js "Hello World!" func [v i s] [pick s i]
res: map-js "Hello World!" func [v] [either v = #"o" [1][0]]	; sum result = count
res: map-js "Hello World!" func [v i] [if v = #"o" [i]]			; remove none! values to keep only index values
res: map-js "Hello World!" func [v i s] [if v = #"o" [at s i]]	; remove none! values to keep only series offsets
```

Too much, or more useful? How would that work if we also want a body-block version? How do we name things if we have both types of interfaces, and will that be confusing? Questions breed questions. :^)

[17:32](#msg5bae6592271506518d89c454)`*while` funcs are also interesting. I've never \*needed* them in my work, but they could be handy: https://gist.github.com/greggirwin/9fc085a8b6b2ca38f756e9285c389674

[17:33](#msg5bae6605c7bf7c3662877432)The plan is to start with the most basic and general HOFs, but we should list and consider what we'll build on them, to help design them in that context. And they will just be another tool in the box, for use when appropriate. FP can be a barrier, so we won't force people to use it or think in that paradigm.

[18:26](#msg5bae7243435c2a518e213f34)Hello, coming from clojure i would say it would be nice to have a fold-like hof, and then map would just be a special case, where the folding-func is :append acc your-function new-value.

[21:03](#msg5bae973919b139275a17f24f)@yvendruscolo as @endo64 says, a gist is a good place to start. I don't think I have my `fold/accumulate` in a gist, but it raises a good design question, given something like the `map` func above, and even in general. FPers don't see any issue (IME), but as you add each layer of abstraction in HOFs, it can be harder to quickly see how things work. i.e., it's an advanced approach for which we may be able to offer an easier to understand alternative.

[06:33](#msg5baf1cc6ae7be94016d49818)@greggirwin Thank you for your reply. I understand there are serious design decisions to be taken before the implementation phase. I agree that you don't need to copy blindly the concepts from other languages and force the use of any particular paradigm.

My most recent programming practice is with J (and less with APL) and I'm used the iterators of the arrays to be inherent part of the verbs. Maybe this is the reason to ask for an alternative of the collect/foreach/keep impementation.

greggirwin

[07:28](#msg5baf2997c08b8b3067a6b93a)We have a couple `J` fans around here. An array-based dialect would be interesting.

[13:53](#msg5baf83f11e23486b9361a333)@greggirwin `/` (insert) variant fits well in Red (it's basically a reverse of the most common `extract` usage), I already sketched an idea in `sum` function PR a while back. Hooks and forks with ranks (fancy words for functional composition and vectorization) - not really.

[14:14](#msg5baf88d25331811c2e23d0c9)@dockimbel As work on I/O is now maybe going to happen... any idea for the best syntax for incremental \_checksums\_?  
I mean this:

```
>> checksum/method "aaabbb" 'md5
== #{6547436690A26A399603A7096E876A2D}
```

was possible to do in Rebol2 using checksum scheme:

```
>> sport: open [scheme: 'checksum algorithm: 'md5]
>> insert sport "aaa"
>> insert sport "bbb"
>> update sport
>> copy sport
== #{6547436690A26A399603A7096E876A2D}
```

My problem with R2 state is, that there is need to call `update` and once the checksum is resolved using `copy`, it does not work anymore:

```
>> insert sport "ccc"
>> update sport
>> copy sport
== none
```

Oldes

[18:43](#msg5bafc7d2bbdc0b2505bf7881)I don't know. But on deeper thought, the `update` was there maybe for a reason... hard to say how it was implemented in R2, but it could just append series to internal buffer and recalculate it in one batch on `update` call.

Hard to say if it is good or no especially when it was not documented.

giesse

[18:44](#msg5bafc7f2c7bf7c36628f3bd2)@rebolek @Oldes probably a matter of adding padding etc.

[18:44](#msg5bafc806435c2a518e289f80)though, i guess `copy` could do that as well.

Oldes

[18:44](#msg5bafc80c1e23486b93633585)I would also not use `insert` and `copy`, but `read` and `write` instead as one could use refinements like `seek` and `part` for `write` because usually one don't need to calculate complete buffer and using `copy` is wasting resources.

@GiuseppeChillemi for learning let's move to the https://gitter.im/red/help I have already posted an answer there.

[20:53](#msg5bb28967600c5f64233bc088)@GiuseppeChillemi for example, if you have `arr: [a [b 1] ]` and you have your "dynamic path" `(store)/a/b`. As Gregg said why don't you set `store` to the word you want to refer and call it like any other path: `store: arr` &amp; `store/a/b`?  
I guess if you have a few objects/blocks with the same structure and you want some value at given path (pseudo-code):

```
q: [arr]
; == [arr]
foreach o q [
    print o/a/b
 ]
```

then I guess it would make sense to use `(o)/a/b`. You can however use temp-word to store temporary value:

```
foreach o q [
    temp: reduce o
    print temp/a/b
]
```

[22:26](#msg5bb3f0a8ae7be94016f102c4)Okay, everybody! Hope your week is off to a great start! I’d like to thank everyone who responded on-list and off to our questions about yourselves. It's a big help for us, because our goal is to make Red as responsive to your needs as possible. While our due date has passed, you can still send your responses to myself or Gregg privately, and I can add them to our sheets. Our set of questions is appended at the end of this update.

Last week in Red saw contributions from across the spectrum from our heavy hitters. In the midst of gearing up for Ethereum’s Devcon 4 in Prague at the end of October, a diverse number of elements are getting worked on:

\- @qxtie has added Trezor hardware support to the Red Wallet, in addition to the LedgerX hardware, a goodly chunk of work (see: here) as well as the ability to set up a batch of payments.

\- There is also new support provided for homebrew APIs for fetching balances, for those who DIY. This is still work in progress, but we’ll write it up in detail when it’s ready.

\- There has also been a lot of work done to add bitcoin support to the wallet, but bitcoin is messy, and we're still looking at whether it's worth including.

\- In Red specifically, a number of modifications have been made to work around MacOS issues, and extra attention paid to the GC/recycle facility, with fixes and tests from @dockimbel, @PeterWAWood, and @qxtie.

\- As for new issues, some GUI aberrations have been observed, related to the appearance of checkboxes and buttons. While not blue-screen-of-death critical, they have been flagged as bugs and will be addressed. Cross platform GUIs are hard, which is why so few do them.

\- Also, more cool demos from @toomasv, who built a protototype interactive GUI editor, and demoed it building a little live-code app.

In the community, some great discussion has been transpiring around the issue of Red’s mission: is it, or should it be, for “everyone” as our public-facing documentation states? And many folks have stated that while they generally don’t pay for software themselves, they WOULD be willing to shell out for a comprehensive book volume on the subject of Red. Tell us what you think!

If you will be at Ethereum DevCon 4, or in the general area of Prague during the first week of November, hit up @GreggIrwin or @dockimbel; they will be hosting a small, informal RedCon after the main Ethereum event. We’d love for you to be there.

Those community questions, again:

Do you consider yourself a programmer?

Do you consider yourself a software engineer?

Do you solve business problems with software?

What kind of problems do you solve?

What other languages have you used?

What is your favorite language, and why?

Is "progammer" or "developer" in your job title?

Do you think Red should be for "everyone" (e.g., like Visual Basic)?

Do you want to use Red for real work, or just fun?

What software do you pay for?

Keep the Red light burning!

[19:14](#msg5bb51533c7bf7c3662af3295)@9214 I am experimenting with paths, as you have read in my recent messages.  
I was trying to understand is using (parens) notation around a word in a path could exectute a function and have the result as basis for the next step of the path.

```
myobj: make object! [afunction: does [afunction2: [one oooo two ttt]]]
```

I am interested interested into expressing like  
myobject/afunction/(afunction2)/two

Returning

\[two ttt]

"afunction2" should be exectued

GiuseppeChillemi

[19:17](#msg5bb515ac1c100a4f2927479e)@9214  
the result of "afunction2" shoul be avalable to the next step of the path selection. So, you can select the result with will be \[two ttt] in this situation.

9214

[19:20](#msg5bb516795331811c2e4534ef)@GiuseppeChillemi that's not how paths work, they alway indexing the first aggregate value. In your example you first indexing `myobj`, then use a non-existent refinement on `afunction`, then start to index a "returned" value from that function.

[19:21](#msg5bb516bfe65a6343367b51b3)Introducing such "feature" leads to nothing but ambiguity, and paths are already a bit clunky as they are.

GiuseppeChillemi

[20:12](#msg5bb522bca9be136b94ef5c19)@9214 Paths actually pick and select but if they pick a function inside an object and I ask for the result to be evaluated using a dedicated syntax, then the next step of the path should receive the result of the evaluation.

Let's suppose double ^ execute functions if found:

```
myobj: make object! [afunction: does [append: [one oooo ] [two ttt]]]
myobj/^afunction^/two
```

should return

```
>>[two ttt]
```

Think about "afunction" selects from an external SQL source, then the result shouls be availabe to the path for being picked.

More one this:

```
myobj: make object! [afunction: funct [a b]  [append: [one oooo ] reduce [A B]]]
myobj/^afunction two ttt^/two
```

should return

```
>>[two ttt]

[20:37](#msg5bb5288cbbdc0b2505e01742)I understand your idea, but I want to voice my opinion that this kind of syntactic sugar is extremely damaging to any language.

[20:39](#msg5bb528fae65a6343367bc28a)in this special case, the path datatype cannot be lexical analysed since there is no way to know how many arguments the afunction has until runtime. which is why using parens works, because like LISP, you manually set the arity of the expression

[20:42](#msg5bb5299c435c2a518e49145f)Red is not an object oriented language (beyond datatypes), so paths are not an intrinsic pattern like they would be if it where the case.

So the skeleton is there, and the flesh will come as and when. This is the first occasion for the specs to be tracking the reality of the implementation in real-time!

Just keep in mind that the `port-type` branch is a temporary version of the `port!` type, because we have a need for it right now, for C3-related tools. The structure and semantics of `port!` will change once the work on 0.7.0 starts. BTW, I expect some good discussions about our I/O and concurrency model during the Redcon in Prague.

We have a short-term deadline, and we don't have time to do all the preliminary design decisions for 0.7.0 in that time window, so we'll go with a "good-enough" `port!` implementation, that should stay in a separate branch, until we decide on the final port model.

Why do you want `decode-url` to work on files? Look at the current code, the `open` action is defined for `url!`, and it will be defined for `file!` too in 0.7.0. `decode-url` is unrelated to files. Moreover, ports can also be defined using `make port! [...]` already.

exactly, in Rebol2 you receive the url and do everything you want within the port's scheme actions. You can even implement your own async mechanisms and callbacks. this is how the ahttp:// scheme is implemented.

dockimbel

[01:44](#msg5bb8137fc7bf7c3662c1e3de)@amreus Such conversion is now more strict, so you need to remove the extra spaces before converting, or you need to invoke the lexer directly:

(I didn't create this snippet, someone else did. I had to dissect it.) A lot of the symbolic programming paradigm aspect of Red is completely foreign to me. Sure there is API documentation via `?`. But many of us come from non-LISP-y backgrounds and have no experience with the entire paradigm. I haven't seen many good examples around this stuff except from Gitter.

[20:18](#msg5bba6a08271506518dd083a9)I know this sounds silly, but much of the documentation around Red is for each dialect. Which of course is very important. Red By Example is also very good API documentation. But I feel these don't do enough to help one think like an expert Red programmer. I feel like more could be done in this area. Later on down the line, maybe some documentation on how each programming paradigm Red embraces is or could be expressed through code would be very helpful. A collection of Toomas examples of how Red can be used would also be good for helping people get a feel for what is possible with Red.

[21:59](#msg5bba81b96e5a401c2d30968b)@AlexanderBaggett Thank you for the example. The "code is data" is indeed a key point that one need to fully understand in order to master the language and advanced coding patterns. More articles explaining such concept would be welcome.

[06:14](#msg5bbaf5c2600c5f64236e8550)@AlexanderBaggett this is an example that I shew you when you asked to demonstrate how Red supports symbolic / meta programming, IIRC for some conference which you planned to attend. I also recall that you haven't asked a single question about it - which either means that you understood example 100% fully, or that you didn't want to dig that deeper at all. "Want" is the key word here. All the "barriers" wouldn't exist if you'd have a curiosity to ask "how the hell this thing works, can anyone explain?" or "can anyone suggest me reading list on stuff like that?".

&gt; I haven't seen many good examples around this stuff except from Gitter

Because this is kinda an advanced topic, which requires a bit of commitment on your side. Most people don't need it, and, based on recent survey, have no interest in mastering these aspects, neither for day-to-day work, nor for teaching them to others in tutorials.

&gt; I feel these don't do enough to help one think like an expert Red programmer

I know what helps. Each evening, open the Red console. Pick some of 99 Lisp problems, or Advent of Code puzzle, or Project Euler math problem, or just approach something with "what if..?" question in your mind, whatever. Write a solution, try to do it better, try to do it the way \_you_ want. Once you've finished (or stuck), come here and ask others to help, start a discussion, ask silly questions, try to answer them yourself, compare yours and someone else's answers.

[14:53](#msg5bbb6f56ef4afc4f283a8556)@9214 . I figured out how your example worked on my own via experimentation and `?`. I don't agree that my desires or motivations can be accurately measured in an all or nothing (boolean) kind of way. As for asking people, I try to save that for a last resort. I prefer to do as much as possible on my own first. Knowledge and understanding that I obtain through my own efforts tends to be more rewarding. But doing things on my own includes looking whats available online. And when I cannot find stuff, I intend to interpret that as a "barrier". And I view requesting additional documentation as "doing something about it".

[15:18](#msg5bbb754f3844923661036ea9)@AlexanderBaggett okay, in such case I'd ask you to explain in your words how the above example works, and to be more specific (tip: "stuff like that" is not specific) with your request; list at least 3 concrete features / concepts that you have trouble with.

@AlexanderBaggett as with any other language, you can write clever code in Red that is hard to understand or maintain. The line between elegance and madness is sometimes thin. :^) \*Unlike* other languages, you can create your own universe, with wormholes, black holes, new laws of physics, and languages/notations to talk about them. We each have to decide when to play God, and when you write boring code that just gets the job done.

[17:02](#msg5bbe3095e65a634336b60864)If you would need to do something on error, than you could use:

```
>> if error? try [1 / 0][ print "oh not again!" ]
oh not again!
```

[17:03](#msg5bbe30db1c100a4f296203d4)So is there any reason, why `error!` value could not be \_falsey\_?

[17:06](#msg5bbe31abe65a634336b612a9)I mixed windows... the above example for `if try [1 / 0][ print "yes" ]` was from Rebol2... in Red it is:

```
>> if try [1 / 0][ print "yes" ]
yes
```

I would prefer to have it not printing anything.

[17:20](#msg5bbe34e4ae7be940163382fe)But to be also opposite advocate.. it looks that in Red `error!` is not a real datatype, so it would require additional checks for any logic comparisons. So probably not worthy the change. One must keep balance.

[18:07](#msg5bbe3fc5ae7be9401633de27)@Oldes  
&gt; it looks that in Red `error!` is not a real datatype

`error!` is a first class datatype:

```
>> type? try [1 / 0]
== error!
```

The fact that its implementation internally inherits from `object!` has no has bearing on being a full datatype.

&gt; As I say... it would be even more difficult to detect it. As you don't want object to be falsey.

At Red level, currently, error values have nothing to do with the `object!` datatype (though, that will probably change in the future).

[18:18](#msg5bbe425c1c100a4f29628de9)About your proposal, at first look, I don't see any show-stopper to make such change, though, as mentioned earlier, `attempt` is already giving you that feature, and the fact that it's a mezz helps keep the core language smaller (less rules to remember).

Oldes

[18:19](#msg5bbe42b1bbdc0b25051ae8ad)Yes... but if you would like to implement my initial idea to have `error!` value to be `false`, you would have to do additional computation to even find, that it is not object, but an error. So slow down every logic test. Solution would be to have flag. So I answered myself that it is probably not something we want even if it looks nice.

dockimbel

[18:21](#msg5bbe4334bbdc0b25051aee71)@Oldes Internally, all values have a type field, so just checking if it's a `TYPE_ERROR` would be enough.

&gt; but wouldn't memory safety prevent those memory access crashes we had (and still have)?

Even in Rust you get memory crashes in the \[unsafe](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html) parts of the code (and there's a lot of `unsafe` Rust code out there in libraries). There is no silver bullet.

[22:10](#msg5bc11bc7e65a634336cb85f8)\_Another reason Rust has an unsafe alter ego is that the underlying computer hardware is inherently unsafe. If Rust didn’t let you do unsafe operations, you couldn’t do certain tasks. Rust needs to allow you to do low-level systems programming, such as directly interacting with the operating system or even writing your own operating system. Working with low-level systems programming is one of the goals of the language._

[22:10](#msg5bc11be6c7bf7c3662000e3e)So basically, \_unsafe_ Rust is Red/System. I would like to add a pointer borrowing system in R/S at some point, so that \_some code_ could be made safer.

[22:14](#msg5bc11cd3bbdc0b2505302f37)Moreover, for those thinking that Rust is a kind of "savior" in PL, it has also some dark sides, like silently ignoring division by zeros and returning wrong values. I hope that Rust devs have found some acceptable solution to that old design issue, because, that's a pretty scary one (shared by Elm language also).

[00:04](#msg5bc136a41e23486b93b5026f)Hey guys, had a question about how the Red compiler produces executables. Does it spew assembly code? How are things such as printing to the console handled (meaning it has to hook up with the OS kernel functions somehow)?

greggirwin

[05:02](#msg5bc17c6f271506518d037261)@Pebaz, Red compiles to Red/System, and that compiler emits machine code directly. No C, no ASM, no other intermediate. It's possible to do add other back ends of course, but this makes Red a completely standalone toolchain, and can cross compile directly to other platforms from any host platform.

greggirwin

[16:43](#msg5bc766a76e5a401c2d88b358)To profile code, you need to run it a number of times, preferably with execution times long enough that OS variances are minimized. That's generally where confusing numbers come up.

dockimbel

[20:34](#msg5bc79ccaf659e67772d119f1)@NjinN Your benchmark is wrong, you are including I/O using `print` in it, which makes the measurement irrelevant. That's another example of why you shouldn't do (micro-)benchmarking and do public claims about performances, without a deep understanding of what you are actually measuring in the first place.

BeardPower

[22:17](#msg5bc7b50a600c5f6423c6b54f)@dockimbel He is also confused about the order of the print. The time stamps are printed out first and the function value at last, although the function is called and it's value is printed out in between the timestamps.

It is same as: parse body-of m [set-word! integer!] ? rebolek 13:41@toomasv of course 13:42the thing is that if you care about content of map/object when parsing, you have to either change original input or run another parse inside parse 13:42both these methods have their disadvantages toomasv 14:08@rebolek Interesting, currently it would work something like this: m: #(a: 1) parse reduce ['some m 'things] rule: [ some [ahead map! s: change map!

Then collect and keep will need to maintain state though (simple stack). There's a similar dilemma about global vs local return and exit. rebolek 15:54@toomasv yes, that works if you not care about changing the input block. 15:55@giesse that's something I was thinking of about too. dockimbel 18:58@9214 > Re bind: it gets tricky with each new nesting level added. What @rebolek asks, I think, is if keep can be bound to collect automatically during evaluation. can something like this be done with an access to evaluation stack? I don't get the question, keep is already bound to collect during evaluation of the body block. 9214 18:59@dockimbel only if keep was in the top -level block. block: [keep 1] collect [reduce block] 19:00I know I can bind block to collect, but it gets tedious in more complex cases. dockimbel 19:01@rebolek > Another thing: I think that parse's into should be able to accept map! and object! and automatically traverse over body-of such values. Yes, that's something we've discussed with Gregg recently. Though body-of is expensive, as it recreates a new full block of words and values on each call. I would rather have a into symbols and into values . 19:09@9214 It might be possible to implement a JIT-binding for that (though, it would still need a stack for nested bindings), making the evaluation native functions bind their argument block just before evaluating them. 9214 19:09@dockimbel sounds cool! dockimbel 19:11Though, it could make it more complex to reason about bindings. Even with the simple current model, many people don't get it, because most still think in terms of "scopes". 9214 19:14@dockimbel nothing that a set of good tutorials and documentation cannot fix. Most people won't go that deep anyway. rebolek 19:43@dockimbel > I would rather have a into symbols and into values . Why not, if it's faster, I'm all for it. 19:46If I understand it correctly, I would need to do both to parse whole body of object, right? I can live with that, it's still better than changing original block. dockimbel 20:09@rebolek It depends on what you are interested into. You could start with symbols, then when you can get the word you are interested in, you can invoke into again on its value. Saturday 20th October, 2018 greggirwin 03:34I may have missed if someone commented on the reduce/compose approach for keep, as Red is about controlling evaluation. toomasv 10:40@9214 > it gets tricky with each new nesting level added Don't know. It seems to work nice e.g. in this multi-level logging example: actors: bind [ foreach e extract/index system/view/evt-names 2 2 [ keep reduce [ e reduce [ 'print 'rejoin compose [ face/type dot (to-string e) "^/^-event: [" collect [ foreach attr exclude system/catalog/accessors/event! [window type] [ if attempt [event/:attr] [ keep rejoin [ attr ": " mold switch/default attr [ face window [event/:attr/type] ][ event/:attr ] ] ] ] ] #"]" "^/^-face: [" collect [ fc: either all [attempt [event/face] same? event/face face][event/face][face] foreach attr exclude words-of fc [state actors on-change* on-deep-change*] [ if any [ all [find [visible? enabled?] attr not fc/:attr] all [not find [visible? enabled?] attr fc/:attr] ][ keep rejoin [ attr ": " mold switch/default attr [ parent [fc/parent/type] pane [length? fc/pane] selected [either fc/type = 'window [attempt [fc/selected/type]][:fc/:attr]] ][ :fc/:attr ] ] ] ] ] #"]" ] ] ] ] ] :collect view collect [ do actors foreach f [ [area "area"][field "field"][text "text"][base "base" ] return [panel [box red]][text-list data ["A" "B"]][tab-panel ["A" [] "B" []]] return slider scroller ][ keep f unless find [return across below] f [do actors] ] ] @greggirwin reduce/collect would be more complicated in the above case IMO. planetsizecpu 10:44@rebolek thank you, I just check with each automatic build if my scripts work correctly, but I do not need to be up to date either, it's just a matter of sanity check. Now the question about parse & keep has gone too deep for my tastes, I'm not willing to dig on it at all 😃 rebolek 10:51@toomasv can you use collect in collect with this approach? toomasv 10:52@rebolek There are two collects inside the top-level collect. rebolek 10:52Ok, I have to try it. Thanks. toomasv 10:53You are welcome! 9214 11:35@toomasv I wasn't talking about large blob of nested blocks, but about block that has words that refer to other blocks (like in @rebolek's original example), which in turn have words referring to other blocks. And further down the line you may have words that are created at run-time and cannot be bounded in advance. 11:36In such cases you either need to bind each block manually, or use multiple composes; both ways are ugly and impractical. toomasv 12:39Ah :flushed: greggirwin 15:36The more creative and dynamic you get, the trickier things get. toomasv 15:37Indeed. lucindamichele 21:35Hello, REDucers! Great news. At long last, it's time for an updated Red Wallet! This version adds some key upgrades: Trezor Hardware Key Support First, and perhaps most important, is support for Trezor hardware keys. If you have a Trezor, now you can use the Red Wallet with it to transact in ETH or RED. As with our support of the Ledger Nano S, the USB driver for the Trezor is written in Red/System, and built right into the wallet, so no annoying driver downloads. Go try it yourself: https://www.red-lang.org/2018/10/red-wallet-alpha-2.html ETH Batch Payments Another nice feature, though without an obvious UI affordance yet, is batch payments. If you send the same amounts to the same addresses, on a regular basis, you'll love this. You can set up a list of addresses, amounts for each, and then click Send just once. You don't have to go back and forth between the key and the Wallet UI: Click, click, click, and away they go! Yes, you can have multiple batches for different purposes. We have more UI changes in the works, to improve usability, and more features to come. Read about how to make Batch Payments: https://www.red-lang.org/2018/10/red-wallet-alpha-2.html Faster, Stronger, Better -Balance loading is much faster now. We believe we're the fastest wallet out there in this regard, thanks to some new back end pieces. -There are also some improvements in how the Wallet handles various hardware key states. -With this release, we'll also update our binary checking service, so you can make sure you've got an official, secure build from us. And you can always access the source code, to see how it works, and have your own audits done, in addition to the audits we have done. Download the RED Wallet application here: https://www.red-lang.org/2018/10/red-wallet-alpha-2.html Windows 7/8/10 [303 KB] macOS 10.1x [295 KB] Just click on the executable to run it (extract the .app file first on macOS), no installation or setup process required. Plug in your Ledger Nano S key and enjoy a smooth and simple experience! Sunday 21st October, 2018 pekr 05:26Congrats on the new Red Wallet release! Reading about the 300KB app with no dependencies in today's computing world is kind of unbelievable. Hope the Walled is well adopted by the crypto public .... Jan69 21:45Hello! Just popped in to ask about plans on getting View (or any kind of graphical stuff) over to Linux, is that given up on, or is it just a slow process? Haven't really seen any mention of it anywhere, except a few years old reddit post... If Red had graphics, I'd consider it for a hobby language to experiment around in, but for just CLI , I'm not sure (and yeah, Wine is a thing, but I really would prefer if that wasn't a requirement to get half the examples working...)...I'll still try and see it as is, for a little bit... endo64 22:52@Jan69 There is an official GTK branch (https://gitter.im/red/red/gui-branch) but it isn't a priority of core team for the moment. Monday 22nd October, 2018 lucindamichele 22:31@pekr "kind of unbelievable"...it's true, it's true! :) We're very happy with it. Tuesday 23th October, 2018 loziniak 02:27Hi! I've finally managed to make an external library call with callback: https://github.com/loziniak/safenet.red/blob/master/safe.red Probably very buggy (I'd appreciate a code-review), but working :-) dockimbel 02:42@loziniak Nice! After a quick look, I think you could simplify it by using #call from R/S, to invoke a trampoline function that would evaluate a block, holding your function call + arguments. You could construct such block from Red and pass it to R/S, then append or poke arguments in it when the callback is invoked. lucindamichele 19:56Tap, tap. Is this thing on? It's time for an announcement! ... ... ... Hello REDucers! Our mission to fight software complexity is going to be showcased alongside Ethereum's Devcon IV in Prague. If you're in the neighborhood, stop by Redcon! Got questions? We've got answers: ... So what's Redcon all about? Redcon is for anyone interested in open-source, full-stack, domain-specific languages built using Red Language or any of its dialects. We'll be having a casual meetup-style event, with food and adult beverages. ... And who will be there? Red's designer, Nenad Rakocevic, will discuss the language and its capabilities. A Q&A session, presentations and demos are also on the agenda. Also present will be Gregg Irwin, leading governance and language design for the Red Foundation. Other core contributors to Red (The Team Red Irregulars) are coming too. ... What will we discuss? ~Red/C3, Red's domain-specific language for making Ethereum's smart contracts safer and simpler ~The latest version of Red Wallet ~How Red's DSLs build fantastic Dapps ~World domination (or, "How to take over the world!" for fans of Pinky and The Brain) ... What do we get outta this (besides that warm fuzzy feeling)? ~Treats and goodies ~Food & drinks ~Raffle prizes from Leatherman, PacSafe, Travelon, and Victorinox ~Input on Red tooling and features ~Join and enjoy the awesome Red community ... Okay. Where and when? November 3, 2018, from 11am - 5pm (with informal pub time after) Hotel Olšanka, Praha 3, Táboritská 23/1000, PSC (ZIP) 13000. https://www.hotelolsanka.cz/ 2ND FLOOR CONFERENCE ROOM 20:03Basically, if you're in the Prague area, or even remotely close (remotely close? Is that an oxymoron?), you should swing on by Hotel Olšanka (which bills itself as a "congress and wellness" hotel, not sure what that means but it sounds swell) and have a couple beers and talk with us. Ask us questions, and we have questions for you, too. About what you're looking for in a programming language. About how you plan to use smart contracts, and how the Red language could help you. We want to work together to make this thing even more awesome, even more useful, even more simple and elegant and straightforward. meijeru 20:21I noticed that Packt Publishing (the ones that published the first Red book) have added a new book to learning resources about "Red Teaming", which has absolutely nothing to do with the Red language. _"Red Teaming is used to enhance security by performing simulated attacks on an organization in order to detect network and system vulnerabilities"_. I suggest that this be removed as it does not contribute to the Learning resources. lucindamichele 20:44@meijeru Hmm. Let me look into that. 9214 21:09@meijeru I'd rather remove both books with that kind of attitude. 21:12Fixed. dockimbel 22:32@lucindamichele Great, thanks! Looking forward to meet with you guys on RedCon weekend in Prague! greggirwin 23:17@meijeru is there a link to that Red Teaming resource? 23:18"Red" is a high conflict word, unfortunately. x8x 23:19 @greggirwin https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BLINKS%5D-Learning-resources/_compare/0e923243e1ab5737b1ab6e27378564c6efa356e3...9d0654ce0808bd1afbb760222204f09aa5aa50cb greggirwin 23:40Thanks. Saw that @9214 already cleaned it up. @Ivo-Balbaert, if you could touch base with Packt and ask their promo team to make sure links are related to projects, that would be great. The Red Teaming stuff has *nothing* to do with us. Wednesday 24th October, 2018 meijeru 18:16Meanwhile even Ivo's book has disappeared. Was that necessary? It has a preface by Gregg and I am mentioned as reviewer. Looks like enough credentials to stay on. 9214 18:17@meijeru that one was a duplicate. Link to the book is kept [here](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BLINKS%5D-Learning-resources). meijeru 18:18OK! endo64 23:23Should this form supported by replace? replace [a b] [a | b] 'x Currently if both arguments are blocks then it uses find, if the first argument is any-string! and the second is block! then it uses parse. 23:44Sorry, it should be: replace [a b] ['a | 'b] 'x. It switches to parse mode if deep is used. >> replace [a b] ['a | 'b] 'x == [a b] >> replace/deep [a b] ['a | 'b] 'x == [x b] >> replace/deep/all [a b] ['a | 'b] 'x == [x x] At least we should write a good document about replace, help string says pattern "Specific value or parse rule pattern to match." but it is not clear when it is parse rule and when not. BeardPower 23:52As it says: value -> no parse, parse rule -> parse 23:53This is not a parse rule but a value -> no parse. >> replace [a b] 'a 'x == [x b] endo64 23:56What is the difference with a value of block and a parse rule? 23:56replace [a b] ['a | 'b] 'x in this case ['a | 'b] is a value or a parse rule? 23:57It is value, I know. But it is a parse rule in replace/deep [a b] ['a | 'b] 'x case. Thursday 25th October, 2018 greggirwin 00:34No time to think about it now, but we *should* revisit and make the design clear and consistent. GiuseppeChillemi 20:36[![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/red/red/MWJ5/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/red/red/MWJ5/image.png) 20:37I have read about the RedCon. It could be nice if you stream it so distant memebers of RED community could partecipate rebolek 20:38@GiuseppeChillemi I don't know about stream, but it will be recorded. GiuseppeChillemi 20:40@rebolek https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/blog/webinar/livestream-your-event-online-ds00/ 20:42https://blog.capterra.com/free-live-stream-tools-event/ rebolek 20:42I have normal offline video camera :) 9214 20:43@GiuseppeChillemi and who will control and moderate the stream? Tooth fairy? GiuseppeChillemi 20:45If possible, make it one way stream. Or you fear about RED/REBOL/REN-C members go livestream fighting each other ? :-) 9214 20:46I'd ask you to remove this comment. GiuseppeChillemi 20:47Why ? 9214 20:47It's inappropriate, to say the least. GiuseppeChillemi 20:49You should read what resides in my heart to say it is inappropriate. Do you know it ? rebolek 20:49It's a joke. 9214 20:49Except no one is laughing. GiuseppeChillemi 20:51@rebolek It is both a joke and a unwritten prayer... 20:51... a prayer for peace and cooperation. 20:52This is what resides in my heart. A profund disappointment and a prayer to be together to be a great, strong and prosperous community. 20:53Not all phrases have an evil intent behind them. 20:53Lets hope for the future. 20:56@rebolek I think youtube live stream could work from you mobile device. If the hotel hosting the conference would provide a simple wifi connection you would be able to stream it worldwide. rebolek 20:57you certainly won't want to see stream from my phone GiuseppeChillemi 20:57Steal a phone from someone and go live streaming ! rebolek 20:58:D 9214 20:58Oh, another funny joke. GiuseppeChillemi 20:59Just a dark and fizzy koke for me ! 21:03That's my proposal. Hope RedCon could be live streamed other than recorded. It would be like being there and partecipating in the very first row. greggirwin 21:56@GiuseppeChillemi while it sounds like adding streaming should be easy, it never is, IME. We will do whatever we can to make people feel included, but won't promise things without feeling we can deliver. 21:56Also, I didn't take your comment as rude. 22:00The various Redbol projects are all very separate right now, which has kept the peace. 22:03Remember, on streaming, that someone has to spend most of their live experience managing that, so they give up really being a part of things. We want people who are there to get the most out of it as well. Timezones also come into play, if live streaming. GiuseppeChillemi 22:24@greggirwin Thanks, if you will stream we will enjoy partecipating in real time, otherwhise I will see the whole conference when you will make it available. 22:28> The various Redbol projects are all very separate right now, which has kept the peace. Yes, I can feel it. Things are going well here and there, only REBOL3 from REBOL tech is suffering for no developmen. Lets wait and see. nedzadarek 22:31> I don't know about stream, but it will be recorded. That's good! Will you provide notes (pdf or something) as well? 9214 22:37@nedzadarek what kind of notes? nedzadarek 22:49@9214 I mean when a presenter present something s/he some informations/images on the screen. rebolek 22:57That's up to presenters I guess. BeardPower 23:56I'm pretty sure they will share their presentations/slides. Friday 26th October, 2018 NjinN 01:58Want some notes about Red language, especially Red/System. 02:01And question again. If I want to bind +with add, I can use the to-set-word '+ :add on Rebol2, and the +: :add on Rebol3, but both of them can't work on Red 9214 02:02@NjinN what do you mean by "bind + with add"? NjinN 02:03And the do [+: :add] make red.exe quit 9214 02:04Well, it happens because you've just redefined addition operator and broke all other definitions that rely on it. NjinN 02:07[![NYWY[]XWN4D7]%FJ~3VHISR.png](https://files.gitter.im/red/red/cksR/thumb/NYWY__XWN4D7__FJ_3VHISR.png)](https://files.gitter.im/red/red/cksR/NYWY__XWN4D7__FJ_3VHISR.png) 9214 02:07@NjinN uhm, that's not how it works. 02:08You converted '+ to :+ and then returned the value of :add (an action!) as a result of whole expression. 02:08Original + is still there. NjinN 02:10What difference between +: :addand do [+: :add] 9214 02:10No difference. 02:11:point_right: https://gitter.im/red/help NjinN 02:15Maybe you should try both of them youself. 9214 02:15What's that suppose to mean? 02:16Anyway, let's keep this room on topic and move to /help. planetsizecpu 07:35@greggirwin Will wait anxious for media, and will love some shots on beer time at the pub :-) dockimbel 18:06@lepinekong_twitter Please re-post your message with a normal font size and I will delete the big one. Saturday 27th October, 2018 greggirwin 17:46> @lpeinekong said: #include is ok for packaging exe but for dynamic a complex dependencies tree from internet it's just do, load-thru is not enough, something like webpack functionalities would be great ;) https://webpack.js.org/guides/ Sunday 28th October, 2018 meijeru 09:26I notice activity on two new datatypes: hex! and bigint!. I suppose this has to do with Red/C3? Because otherwise I must wonder why there is such a dispersion of effort. pekr 10:16My guess is, that you might be actually right :-) 9214 14:29@meijeru they are a part of C3 development, but ultimately contribute to the core language outside of C3 scope. meijeru 15:41Tx! Monday 29th October, 2018 greggirwin 17:10@9214 is correct, with many decisions still to be made. It's tricky when C3 really could benefit from a type, but Red not so much. So we have to make the designs truly useful in Red as well. 9214 17:11@greggirwin the only nitpick I have is a better name for bigint!. greggirwin 17:15big-int!? pekr 19:12is bigint! going to replace a money!type? I mean, IIRC in R3, money!type was supposed to serve for a BCD purpose? Or are those two completly separate topic? 19:13Hmm, as I think more about it, I might answer to myself probably, that those two are different types? moliad 19:53*please* no dash in datatypes names 19:55any way to know in **advance** the size for a yet to be rendered text in Red/view/draw ? 19:57I need to do some graphics, and the lack of anchor positioning is a big road-block for a lot of graphics work. If I can at least measure the text before I draw it, I can calculate the anchor myself and display text centered or right-aligned (same issues for vertical alignment) 19:59(monospace fonts are not very sexy, the selection is also pretty limited) rebolek 20:06@moliad size-text 20:07Also, [Iosevka](https://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/) is sexy monospace font. moliad 20:08it has a sexy name... looks pretty good too, I admit, thx :-) rebolek 20:08:) 20:10@moliad with size-text, watch out for https://github.com/red/red/issues/3548 moliad 20:13@rebolek thx for the note about the bug... might be something relatively easy to fix, given the core functionality is already there. in any case, I need single line measurements for now, so it should be sufficient for at least my tests right now. 20:14that font is REALLY nice. first time I see a design so well laid out with the same font in serif and sans-serif... really cool rebolek 20:15IIRC single line works fine. I've been using size-text for my rich-text draw renderer before RTD was introduced in Red and it was very usable. 20:15Yes, Iosevka is really great font. It's one of first things I'm installing on fresh system. x8x 20:16Stumbled yesterday on this mono font, not bad https://dank.sh/ 20:19@rebolek just curious, at what size do you use the losevka and on a monitor with how much dpi for code? rebolek 20:21@x8x I use Iosevka Term Light, size 12 on [125.37 DPI](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_X230) x8x 20:25Thanks! I was just about to ask which variants, many variants! :smiley: 20:26Which ss.. ? rebolek 20:27I don't know :) meijeru 21:02Unlike losevka, which is free, dank has to be bought for 40 GBP. Wednesday 31st October, 2018 Ungaretti 08:49I have made some serious configuration to Notepad++ and ended up with an editor for Red language that is quite lean and uncluttered. I packed it along with the latest version of Red into what I called Rededitor. It has "play" button that saves and executes the script in a single step. Before I add examples to the package and link it in helpin.red, I would like to know if it donwloads and runs OK, with no anti-virus issues, so, please, give me some feedback. Here is the link for download: [Rededitor](http://helpin.red/Rededitor.zip) . Just unzip it somewhere, it's self contained. 08:57Screenshot: ![alt](http://helpin.red/Screenshot.PNG) mikeparr 08:58@Ungaretti - when I try to open it with peazip on Windows, I get the message: "Archive is not readable. Would you like to try a password?" Ungaretti 09:00@mikeparr Interesting. I zipped it with 7-zip, it was supposed to be a regular zip. I have unzipped it with 7-zip. I'll try some other software. 09:09@mikeparr Very strange. I unzipped a freshly downloaded file with PeaZip portable 64 with no problem. spTorin 09:23@Ungaretti Reditor - better name :) toomasv 09:23@Ungaretti Great! My first tries are successful! mikeparr 09:23@Ungaretti yes it is strange - I have tried my peazip (32bit) on other zip files - works ok. 10:41@Ungaretti - more info. I tried 7-zip, with same result. Then just downloaded your zip again a few mins ago, works OK. Good! Ungaretti 11:22@mikeparr Good! So I guess your first download was corrupted somehow. @spTorin Yes, sounds better. I'll think about it. Did it work ok for you? @toomasv :thumbsup: I thought about adding your "flower" gist to the examples I plan to add to the package, do you mind? Would be nice if more people could confirm it downloads and runs fine. rebolek 11:59I've unzipped it on Linux without problem. 12:00I'll try it once I'll install Notepad++ on my W10 VM. Ungaretti 12:46@rebolek It comes with a portable copy of Notepad++ that works independetly from full Notepad++ install. Well, you can't run both at the same time, but otherwise ... rebolek 12:48@Ungaretti Ah cool then! I'll check it with portable version, that's much more convenient certainly. viayuve 12:53@Ungaretti how to do this in notepad++ like one side console and other side editor 12:55like there in VS code editor above and console below 12:56for me its working W7 32 bit Ungaretti 13:01@viayuve the only way I know is to positon them on the screen as you like and then close them. New instances will open in the same place and with the same size. 13:01I t toomasv 13:02@Ungaretti :+1: Of course you may! :smile: Here is my new experiment: [![tinybrowser](http://vooglaid.ee/red/tinyredbrowser.gif)](http://vooglaid.ee/red/tinyredbrowser.gif) Ungaretti 13:03@ Lovely! Thanks. viayuve 13:07@toomasv red insted of php very cool link please toomasv 13:10@viayuve :smile: lepinekong_twitter 14:21new trend that can be very interesting for red : GraalVM removes the isolation between programming languages and enables interoperability in a shared runtime. https://www.graalvm.org/ https://medium.com/graalvm/analyzing-the-heap-of-graalvm-polyglot-applications-b9963e68a6a BeardPower 15:35https://hashlink.haxe.org/ dockimbel 18:37@toomasv Great! Any link to the source code? toomasv 18:47@dockimbel Very raw still, just early experiment, but [here it is](https://github.com/toomasv/learning/blob/master/browser/text-browser3.red) moliad 20:33I'm trying to use to-image, can't seem to get it to work. (0.6.3 win10) ex: img: to-image make face! [text: "hoho" size: 50x50] 20:34was it disabled or am I doing this wrong? dockimbel 20:34Please upvote this [HN entry](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18347138) to help raise awareness about AV issues we encounter. 20:34@moliad I remember a fix done on master branch about that. Try it with latest commit. 20:35BTW, we plan to release 0.6.4 soon asap after the Ethereum conference. moliad 20:39quick question @dockimbel , will we be able to add new async devices with the up and comming port mechanism (ex: ZeroMQ)? dockimbel 20:51@moliad Should be possible, yes. You'll be calling from R/S the same internal API as the one we'll be using for the built-in async ports. Though, if you map to external libs, they'll need to be async, or you'll need to put them in a separate thread. moliad 20:56cool. this is very promising. Btw we are currently fully engaged on porting to Red, I've got two people working almost full-time on various Red toolchains. We'll be publishing a few cool projects in a few weeks. we are evaluating a (already heavily modified) cheyenne version which would use zeroMQ and a Red back-end. dockimbel 21:12@moliad Glad to hear that! :+1: We should talk about that once we get the C3 alpha 1 out, and eventually paying you a visit to Montreal. greggirwin 21:16After we're recovered, I can also dust off my 0MQ lib. moliad 21:16it would be really great to get another visit, you could meet the team and we could show you some of the work we've begun :-) 21:16@greggirwin that's what we're basing our current work on. greggirwin 21:17:+1: Way ahead of me as usual. moliad 21:18end goal is a clustered processing platform called liquid net. the GC and port releases couldn't be more aligned in time. :-) 21:21I'll try to solve the memory allocation problem next week. ... btw.. here is a graph of the time vs quantity (built in a graphic lib we're building in Red) ... seems to be a relatively substantial exponential factor in load... endo64 21:23@moliad make face! [text: "hoho" size: 50x50] I think it is mandatory to set type when you use make face! moliad 21:23[![mem-vs-time.jpg](https://files.gitter.im/red/red/MKj1/thumb/mem-vs-time.jpg)](https://files.gitter.im/red/red/MKj1/mem-vs-time.jpg) 21:25@endo64 what type ? 21:25my expected behavior is Rebol2 (just what I expect based on experience... not that it's proper or better) endo64 21:29@moliad make face! [type: 'base text: "test"] AlexanderBaggett 21:30@toomasv , Where do your cool example/demo applications live? I was hoping to explore and experiment with some of them. moliad 21:30@endo64 still getting none as a result... :-o 21:35btw, I'm running above line from GUI console. I've been using Red vid without issues so far, including draw and other things... strange this little issue.

They are mainly just learning experiments. moliad 19:50@dockimbel can you see a technical problem about eventually using show directly on an face rather than view (I could implement it if the back-end just needs a few more verifications to connect things outside of view (maybe even adding a refinement to prevent the window in view)? my use-case for using to-image is to render in the BG (not using view). In the meanwhile, I guess that if you've used view once, you can then change the face properties, show and to-image will update properly, so I could just flash the "render" window quickly and then do my continual rendering in the BG? dockimbel 22:13@moliad There might be some workaround by creating a memory DC for the rendering, though I am not sure that it would work for all the native widgets. @qtxie can answer that better. view is just a wrapper on show. On simple way to avoid flickers on screen could be to use a negative offset for the window position. 22:16If a face object has been shown once, the OS resources are attached to it, and to-image should then work. moliad 23:06ok thx for the precisions. Friday 2nd November, 2018 pekr 04:59I do remember Carl talking about the Rebol/Command version for the server purposes, with the image manipulation stuff, to allow server scripting processing. But dunno, if, or how it was actually implemented. giesse 05:14@pekr, REBOL didn't use native widgets, so that kind of stuff was easy there. PavelVozenilek 09:19Hello people. Can visit the conference tomorrow in Prague? I am interesting about the language. From the announcement it feels it won't be dedicated only to blockchain/etc. rebolek 11:06@PavelVozenilek of course, you can visit the conference. There may be some blockchain talk, but main focus is the language itself. dockimbel 11:24[![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/red/red/7BT7/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/red/red/7BT7/image.png) 11:25Upcoming new Draw feature.

So do we give a block argument for effects? pekr 16:05could be precede with the effect word lepinekong_twitter 18:40Yeah I want CSS3 like stuffs without their ugly syntax :) 18:42@toomasv what's that tag <?red :) toomasv 20:41@lepinekong_twitter Just a pseudotag :smile: moliad 20:41@dockimbel AFAIK the memory DC should be enough, I may look into it.. dockimbel 21:06@moliad Please coordinate with @qtxie, as he's the one who wrote the to-image code. 21:06For the shadow effect, the draw integration is just a proof of concept, not the final version. moliad 21:10@dockimbel sure. btw, I was able to use the to-image while the window was still open, so its working as advertised :smile: Now I just need to help change the advertisement :smirk: 21:11I've played around with DC in the past. I'll see if I can provide a merge request directly. 21:11(at least for the windows version) endo64 22:53Here you can find my mockup designer written with Red (well, almost a year ago..): https://github.com/endo64/mockup It's very simple, easy to use but useful. Note that I tested only on Windows 10 and it has issues with scaled display. Saturday 3th November, 2018 moliad 00:59@endo64 really cool toomasv 05:55@endo64 Great! greggirwin 08:19@PavelVozenilek , yes, please attend, as well as anyone else in the area. We'll have prize giveaways, snacks, drinks, updates on Red and the team, and also some blockchain talk, so people coming from DevCon get a full overview, but not *just* about C3 and the blockchain side. endo64 08:34Thanks @toomasv @moliad here is on action 08:37[![mock.gif](https://files.gitter.im/red/red/W6Kb/thumb/mock.gif)](https://files.gitter.im/red/red/W6Kb/mock.gif) greggirwin 08:38 RedCon 1 - Agenda 11:00 Welcome Nenad and Gregg 11:10 State of the Project Address Nenad 11:20 State of the Team Address Gregg 11:30 Red Overview Gregg 12:00 Break 12:05 Red Project and Language Interactive 13:30 Big Break 14:00 Stats, Charts, and more Bolek 14:45 Red/C3 Nenad 15:15 Red/C3 Cron (design preview) Gregg 15:30 Prize Giveaway 15:40 Break 15:45 Open Presentations and Chat 16:50 Closing Remarks Nenad and Gregg rebolek 09:30Just a small correction, my talk will be about Values. pekr 09:42Guys, have a great time!

I was on RedCon in Prague, had to leave before it ended, just got back to my office, and wanted to drop by and say I liked the project, and I will be investigating it more, and also following the smart contract aspect (C3) BeardPower 10:35@endo64 Thanks. Let's hope @rebolek Laptop did catch that part ;-) rebolek 10:47@xmunx Hi and welcome! If you have any questions, feel free to ask. There are some specific news for newcomers like https://gitter.im/red/red/welcome and https://gitter.im/red/help but asking here is fine too. 10:50@BeardPower I have 6 hours of recordings, but because of the laptop placement, half of it shows just a belly ;-) I will replace those parts with slides from the presentation and upload results to Youtube. Sound seems to be fine. endo64 11:13@xmunx Welcome! BeardPower 12:31@rebolek A totally new experience ;-) planetsizecpu 13:11@xmunx welcome on board BeardPower 14:12@xmunx Welcome.

So it depends, if R2 runs on an ARM platform you mentioned .... 9214 17:03@corvinux I believe only ARMv5 is supported at the moment. corvinux 17:15I've managed to cross-compile red interpreter on macos for arm RPi architecture but without red/system compiler option.

Now that we've done DevCon (videos, a report-back and photos coming soon), Red Language Foundation is having smaller meetups with its core team throughout Europe. While the team is circling back, I personally wanted to ask everyone here what THEIR favorite developers' meetup or conference is. You can reply here or feel free to message me. I've compiled a list of my own, but wanted to check in with all of you, and see if I've missed any hidden gems. Swight1423 19:05New here coming from a vb.net/c# background. created a few very small games in those languages(mostly for speed game competitions). Considering Red for some 2d game development because I don't want the runtime I am working on to cease being available before I finish(worked primarily with version 2.0 of vb.net and c# because I disliked the more html like scripting for gui stuff that came with the later versions,start and end tags with the same text just feels redundant). I also like the idea of keeping things small and optimized. The biggest deterrent for me I think has been the documentation. when half of the information is from another project with some obvious differences you begin to wonder how much of this applies. When I first looked at this project I also had some problems getting VSCode to work been awhile so may be fixed by now(you are still on the same stable version I used then). lucindamichele 19:22@Swight1423 Hmm, that's good feedback we can use. I've messaged you privately to find out more. toomasv 20:20@lucindamichele My favorite one is RedCon (it is also the only one I have participated in :smile: ) lucindamichele 20:20@toomasv That's my fave too. : ) moliad 20:47The devcon we organised in Montreal was a lot of fun. Red was starting to get some recognition, R3 was almost a possibility, a lot of the international expert rebolers where in the same room. The party was very nice, smoking a cigar with Carl in the private poker lounge of that venue we used was a memorable experience. :smile: BeardPower 22:33Time to release the RedCon videos/pictures! 9214 22:51@BeardPower patience, Grasshopper. BeardPower 23:13@9214 Would bribing you with stickers speed things up? ;-) xmunx 23:40OK, so, having come back from Prague, I am now deep into work-related stuff, but really liked what I've seen of Red on the RedCon and I want to give it a good try before/if giving up. So I'll do a small side-project. A program that will run on a server, fire up once per day, go to a website, scrape some information, store it locally, and fire an email if there was a significant change. Should be easy, right? I'll do it this weekend and let you know how it went :). For a bit of background: I've been programming professionally for 12 years now. Changed a few companies and a lot of programming environments/languages, to the point that they're all mixed up in my head. I'm a jack of all languages and a master of none. Two things seem promising with Red (apart from C3, which is very interesting to me because I work in Solidity now): parsing and DSLs. A big amount of any programmer's time is spent parsing text. If there is even a tiny possibility that it can be easier, it warrants investigating. Regarding DSLs, almost always, when I work in a domain, I end up wishing to create a DSL, only to abandon the idea because of the huge overhead involved. If I could rapidly prototype, perhaps I'd get somewhere. I guess I'm after a language that will allow me rapid prototyping. I nowadays use python or node.js for it, but I often feel I have to do more setup (research and library installing and versioning and recoding online examples) than I want to. Thursday 8th November, 2018 moliad 03:19block parsing is definitively something worth spending a bit of effort to understand, even if it may seem a bit daunting at first. if you do a bit of searching, you'll find a few good Rebol PARSE tutorials and that part of Red is very close to the Older Rebol so they should all pretty much work as-is in Red. 03:19Red PARSE is a superset of Rebol2 PARSE micahwelf 04:02I've been programming at some level since the 90's, starting with Batch scripts (DOS) and OS configuration files, and continuing through Bash, Z-Shell, Perl, Python, C, C#, PHP, HTML, and Ada. Of all of these, all pros and cons considered my undoubted favorite is Ada. I can create almost anything I want with Ada, and though wide cross-platform (Android, iOS, embedded systems, etc.) support exists for large companies only there is sufficient support for ARM, i686 (32/64bit), Windows, Linux, and macOS. With it's large libraries and non-graphical traditional nature, Ada is superior for its maintainability, strong typing, built in memory management, built in parallel processing, and access to low-level control (both exact bit placement and ASM) for every aspect of a program, but it cannot combine efficiently low resource usage with a fully graphical environment. This is why I have been trying and watching the Red language for some years. 04:02Red is very different others in a way that suits me. I have dabbled in more than a dozen (maybe two) different languages for curiosity and fun, but I have listed only languages that I have taken seriously and used for non-profit projects or for-profit services. All in all, I see potential for Red to be used for serious low-level stuff like operating systems and OS services some day. Also I see Red as having advantages in programming that are similar to Z Shell. I use Z Shell nearly everyday for simple commands to the system, complex custom configurations, and byte altering programs. It is simple, efficient and very powerful. This said, Red is significantly lower level programming than such a scripting environment and can run much faster. Red also doesn't rely on the Unix-like services, and combines high-level programming with low-level precision and control much like Ada does. Rust might be mentioned by someone when they hear me group Red, Ada, and Z Shell together with praise, but I am not counting Rust, because for all its virtues, it is designed to limit or exclude many uses for high-level programming and simply doesn't have the precision or control of these. 04:02My answer is, Yes! Red should be a language for everyone. There are limits, of course. Businesses can use Red for routine or internal tasks where programming competition is not the main issue, and individuals can use Red for practice or organizational tasks that replace currently used script files. It is precisely because Red is both a compiled and script-oriented language with reasonable typing, real graphical services, and great efficiency that it has potential for everyone. It meets the fundamental criteria: it is useful and usable for nearly everyone, and it seems to be used and supported. planetsizecpu 07:08@lucindamichele I do not have a favorite DevCon because I was never in any of them, but I will choose RedCon because it is the only one that would go. rebolek 07:14RedCon is my favourite too, that's why I did one in Brno and one in Prague :smile: lepinekong_twitter 10:43 path-thru https://redlang.red/do-trace on gui-console-2018-6-18-47628.exe I got ...cache/redlang.red/do-trace now with console-2018-10-3-74043.exe I get ...cache/75/75B6599C5DF014B93E64FFC498BC5B8C This is annoying for creating a caching framework like webpack on javascript. > rebolek 10:46Hm, caching with hash seems better idea than caching with just filename IMO. 10:48Hm, it's not caching by content hash, but just by filename hash. So that's not that great. Anyway, I believe that the reason for this change is to have filenames that are fully compatible with filesystem lepinekong_twitter 13:23@rebolek that change sucks: it doesn't bring any clear value and mostly bring downside values, I cannot even find history of versions on redlang site to revert. rebolek 13:29@lepinekong_twitter that change makes lot of sense, certain filesystems may have problem with filename like http://server.com?x=y,,,z=2:l="asdf" 13:30Also finding history is pretty easy, use git blame, GitHub supports it online too: https://github.com/red/red/blame/12ad56be0fc474f7738c0ef891725e49f9738010/environment/functions.red#L860 13:33@lepinekong_twitter what are the downsides? I can't think of any. lepinekong_twitter 16:17@rebolek the downside is obviously the filenames are unreadable for human. for http://server.com?x=y,,,z=2:l="asdf" an encoding system should have been used instead. rebolek 17:52@lepinekong_twitter Right, should, but wasn't. Red has to deal with real world, not with ideals. You're right that cached filenames are not human readable, but the question is - should they? It's easy to turn filename into hash using path-thru or underlying MD5 hashing function. If there's need for reverse lookup (and the question is, if there really is such a need), table with hash->filename pairs can be added. endo64 21:33> A program that will run on a server, fire up once per day, go to a website, scrape some information, store it locally, and fire an email if there was a significant change. Should be easy, right? @xmunx Red perfect fits for your needs, parsing (both text & blocks) & DSLs are the strongest part of Red. The only missing part in your case is sending email. Ports will be available on v0.7.0 , until then you can call an external application or service's REST APIs like Mailtrap (great for testing) or Mailgun for production. Friday 9th November, 2018 lepinekong_twitter 06:16@rebolek I'm talking about real world program not just basic low level system programming who always consider simplistic case. rebolek 06:20What does that mean? How does it limit "real world program"? Each file has unique cached version with easily found name. lepinekong_twitter 06:24@rebolek found how I open explorer and all I can see is cryptic numbers. rebolek 06:26Yes, and? endo64 07:33Cached files are not supposed to "see" by human, they used internally by Red. The main reason of this change was query parameters, they make difficult/impossible to use as file names in some OSes, upper/lower cases was another reason. rebolek 08:37Thanks @endo64, it makes perfect sense. If somebody wants to build caching mechanism on top of *-thru functions, it's easy to add a file with url! -> hash matching. lepinekong_twitter 08:39@endo64 why do you think the world has decided to transition to clear text format instead of binary format ? For many reasons you need to see. So because of this change, I'm giving up creating a full offline mode for complex dependencies. rebolek 08:47@lepinekong_twitter Filesystems have lot of limitations, like case-sensitivity and file-name length that do not map to URLs that well. This way Red makes sure that web-files are properly mapped to local-files. If you're giving up creating offline made, that's your decision, but you still haven't provided a single reason, why this change is stopping you from doing it. BeardPower 12:14All this is another reason why filesystems tend to be slow: because they abstract blocks on the disk as directories/filenames. These two are just a form of abstraction, nothing else. @lepinekong_twitter So you try to tell us that basic low level system programming is not real world programming? Sorry, but I can't follow that statement. As @endo64 already pointed out, cached files are not to be seen by humans because there is no need to. It's purpose is to abstract disk blocks in a different way. rebolek 12:17Thanks @BeardPower @lepinekong_twitter > why do you think the world has decided to transition to clear text format instead of binary format ? That's pretty bold statement and there's ton of binary formats in use, so you need to back it up with some facts. Anyway, MD5 hash filename is still text format. BeardPower 12:22Transition to clear text format makes only sense, if the user depends on it (like with word processors). Take drawing as an example: you are not using a clear text format, but you could (SVG as an example). You could even draw by typing out sequences of RGBA tuples. Use clear text where it makes sense and not create a problem for a solution. 12:25@rebolek Exactly. The MD5 hash is just a different abstraction of a file name. Using a hash for the content also has an implicit feature: it guarantees that the file content was not dealt with, which a file name on it's own is not able to offer. rebolek 12:26@BeardPower yeah, I would prefer caching mechanism based on content hash rather than on filename hash, but that's still better than plain filename. BeardPower 12:27Absolutely. endo64 12:54> @BeardPower yeah, I would prefer caching mechanism based on content hash rather than on filename hash, but that's still better than plain filename. But that would require downloading the content, what if http://example.com/service/?user=me returns a few MB? How do I know the remote file didn't change and can be used from cache, without downloading it? rebolek 12:56@endo64 it would need some additional mechanisms like querying for file size or change date and forcing download to get new data. 12:57@endo64 but without /update, current load-thru doesn't check if there is newer version also, so not much will change. BeardPower 12:59@endo64 One solution would be to inspect the http headers. Most of the time they carry a content hash themselves and other entries to signal if the content was invalidated and has to be re-downloaded. endo64 13:04Yes, but -thru functions will be used for many other protocols, like FTP, POP, file etc., so we would need to change the implementation accordingly, and also different versions and different (non-standard) implementations of the protocols would require special attention. 13:07> @endo64 why do you think the world has decided to transition to clear text format instead of binary format ? For many reasons you need to see. So because of this change, I'm giving up creating a full offline mode for complex dependencies. @lepinekong_twitter I understand your point. It would be better if cached file name can be kept. Current implementation is not a final decision, just done to prevent the compatibility issues of OSes. If we find/propose a better way I'm sure the team considers implementing it. rebolek 13:07Maybe it could be part of system/schemes//caching 13:07or something like that BeardPower 13:10Yeah, for http Etag is a simple solution, for ftp you could use the block header. Of course, every protocol would need a specific check to enable content caching. 13:13@rebolek Something like pre- and post "modules". Oldes 14:12You should discuss this path-thru thing in the pull request. https://github.com/red/red/pull/3124 14:14Also you should note, that there is limit on length of files and urls may be much longer than that. I was proposing mix - use domains as a folders and hash for the rest. At least that is what I was using in my old R2 project. 14:16It would be also good to note, that R2 has /to refinement, where one can write whatever file name likes. lepinekong_twitter 14:20@oldes thanks. Mix would have been better at least. But I don't think I'll enter the debate I will just differ and build path-thru from the older version. rebolek 14:29I still don't understand what's stopping you from using the new one. Palaing 18:07This looks like a bug: view [text-list data ["one" "two" "three"] [prin "change " print face/selected]] when you navigate or change selection in the text-list, the index of first selected item is prepended to all subsequent indexes printed nedzadarek 18:08@Palaing change 1 change 2 change 3 change 1 change 2 change 3 change 1 Seems normal.

Saturday 10th November, 2018 Corvinux_twitter 19:39Hi, I still didn't come to conclusion, Is it possible to build Red and Red/System compiler from source https://github.com/red/red.git to run on armhf linux platform, and how it would best and fastest done? 9214 19:45@PeterWAWood :point_up: ? 19:52@Corvinux_twitter my guess is that you can use R2 ARM build and Github sources to compile your scripts directly on RPi, but you cannot build a toolchain (as the ones provided on Red website) executable yourself, because building process relies on Rebol SDK and requires a license. giesse 19:52@Corvinux_twitter if I'm not mistaken, the *compiler* is written in REBOL, so you need REBOL on that platform. You can build the *interpreter* though. PeterWAWood 23:05@Corvinux_twitter As @giesse explained the current bootstrap Red and Red/System compilers are written in Rebol. They will be replaced by much improved compliers written in Red. However, this is currently planned after Red 1.0 is released. It could be a long time before it happens. As @9214 explained you need a REBOL SDK to produce the current Red executable. There isn't one for ARM. There is a version of Rebol2 for ARM (hard float) which, if it worked, could be used to run the compilers from source. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. So for now, it is only possible to cross-compile Red code for ARM processors. 9214 23:06Thanks @PeterWAWood ! Sunday 11st November, 2018 TheHowdy_gitlab 10:11I've found something interesting today: >> math [ 1 + 2 * 2 ] == 5 >> math [ 1 + 2 ** 2 ] == 9 Is there a reason why the last expression is 9 instead of 5 or is it a bug? 9214 10:13@TheHowdy_gitlab the reason is that math dialect is unfinished, and doesn't support ** operator. 10:14For now it just bumps precedence of / with * and divide with multiply. TheHowdy_gitlab 10:14Oh well, maybe it should be documented somewhere? It's a pretty nasty thing to discover in bigger expressions. 9214 10:15It's documented in the source code :wink: TheHowdy_gitlab 10:16... Wow 10:19Hm... I don't see it beeing documented even in the source code: https://github.com/red/red/blob/06ddce9e888b6a5988b9bf5c62b19b4c4023e6bb/environment/functions.red#L263 Maybe there should be really a small note in the helpstring? 9214 10:20@TheHowdy_gitlab I guess you're not looking at the actual code hard enough. Fair point though, but I doubt anyone reads docstrings these days. TheHowdy_gitlab 10:21@9214 For learning about Red functionality, I actually do. 9214 10:22Then you should've notice that only [a few](https://github.com/red/red/blob/06ddce9e888b6a5988b9bf5c62b19b4c4023e6bb/environment/functions.red#L270) operators / functions are taken into account. 10:23Ah, you meant docstrings, sorry. TheHowdy_gitlab 10:23@9214 Yes ;) 10:23Sorry, ye, docstrings. 9214 10:25BTW, coming up with more robust and clean math version would be a nice excercise and welcomed contribution, e.g. try to implement shunting-yard algorithm. 10:25Though, it's not suitable for general cases, but still an interesting challenge. TheHowdy_gitlab 10:28@9214 Hehehe, nice idea. I'll definitly look at it.

Ability to overwrite precedence rules and even associativity is quite interesting though, albeit not very useful. :confused: 17:06Final, seemingly working version: math: function [ expression [block!] /local match /only ][ table: [ '** ['* | '/ | '%] ['+ | '-] ] term: compose [(pick [number! scalar!] only) | paren!] binary: [term operator term] wrap: [change only copy match binary (to paren! match)] expression: copy/deep expression do probe also expression foreach operator table [ parse expression rule: [ any [ if (operator = '**) ahead [term operator rule] [fail] ; not general enough | some [ahead wrap] skip | ahead paren! into rule | skip ] ] ] ] toomasv 18:17@9214 :+1: Congratulations! 9214 18:17@toomasv I'm still a bit surprised that some [ahead wrap] skip works as intended. :question: 18:20And more interesting version evolves if wrap is changed to: wrap: [change copy match binary (do match)] toomasv 18:22Yes, I played with immediate change too a bit (but didn't get far) 18:24This can fire back if one term is un-ordered paren, I think. 9214 18:25Unordered..? toomasv 18:25(3 + 2 * 5) 9214 18:26 text >> math [(3 + 2 * 5)] == 13 18:27Rules are the same - imagine that it wraps binary expression AND instantly evaluates it. 18:27Which is the same as wrapping everything in proper order and then doing top-level expression. toomasv 18:31This is with your latest wrap change: >> math [(3 + 2 * 5) * 2] [50] == 50 And this is without it (final version): >> math [(3 + 2 * 5) * 2] [(((3 + 2) * 5) * 2)] == 50 9214 18:36Good catch.

PeterWAWood 22:54@moliad The Red compiler does not run on the ARM version of Rebol2 (http://www.rebol.com/downloads/v278/rebol-core-278-4-8.tar.gz). moliad 22:55know what is missing? PeterWAWood 22:56As far as I can remember, bug fixes. 22:59When I have enough time, I'll try to re-install Rebol on a Raspberry Pi and test it again. moliad 23:03the hardest part for us was getting the armhf version libs to install on the linux itself. (possibly easier on RPi if they have a different lib source setup) greggirwin 23:03Welcome to our new Reducers! Thanks for your input. 9214 23:04@greggirwin 5 days later. I see you're trying :^) greggirwin 23:05On path-thru, there are 2 tickets related to this (#3117 and #3124) and quite a bit of related discussion there. It's not set in stone yet, but it's all tradeoffs. 23:06@9214 this is my last group to catch up on, then back to real work. PeterWAWood 23:08@moliad I didn't come across any problems installing Rebol on Raspberry Pi. It ran "straight out of the box". greggirwin 23:31@9214, your new math code is pretty amazing, and would make a nice article, explaining how it all works. What I would prefer, and others can weigh in, is for math to be an easy-to-understand example of how to build a simple dialect. Even the current version requires a bit of thinking to understand. Q: Is there a reason you have /local before /only? 9214 23:32@greggirwin no specific reason, I came up with /only after setting up the main parsing loop. 23:34There's a lot of recursion involved (both in depth and in width), but I think it can be simplified, perhaps even without touching parse at all. Tuesday 13th November, 2018 lepinekong_twitter 13:46On rebol accessing a non-existing member generates an error >> c: [a: 1 b: 2] == [a: 1 b: 2] >> c/c ** Script Error: Invalid path value: c ** Near: c/c On Red it returns none which is surprising. rebolek 13:53@lepinekong_twitter You are talking about Rebol 2. Rebol 3 changed that behaviour and Red followed that decision, so it's not surprising at all. 13:59It was part of changes in R3 where some previous errors were relaxed, because of typical usage patterns. You can still test for c's presence in the c block with other techniques. Wednesday 14th November, 2018 lepinekong_twitter 01:00@rebolek then it was a bad design decision for me because in typical usage pattern you won't access a member that doesn't exist especially contrary to javascript that you cannot create new member on the fly as easily. nedzadarek 01:42I wonder what are pros & cons of this (raising an error vs returning something like none). Of course a language count. greggirwin 03:20@nedzadarek it's all tradeoffs. In this case, path syntax does the same thing as select, but select never errors, so you had to use 2 different syntaxes in R2, based on the behavior you wanted. There may be old notes about the change, but in a dynamic, data oriented language, it's natural for things to be more forgiving in some cases. It does mean that when you're writing more mission critical code, you are aware of the behavior, how none values might propagate, etc. rebolek 04:30@lepinekong_twitter I understand that no design decision may please everyone, but this was seen as a positive change almost universally IIRC. What do you mean that you cannot create new member on the fly easily? There's insert and append what could be easier? Magic? endo64 07:18It relaxed for this common usage pattern: >> c: [a: 1 b: 2] >> either v: c/x [print v] [print "ko"] ko Otherwise we should use attempt or check if the value exists first. toomasv 07:52@lepinekong_twitter select-or-return-error: func [series value][ either find series value [ select series value ][ cause-error 'user 'message ["Value does not exist in series!"] ] ] 09:28Or, if you prefer :smile: : c: [a: 1 b: 2] c/(either find c 'x ['x][cause-error 'user 'message ["Oops!"]]) rebolek 09:29niiiiice.... 9214 09:30@9214 gasps and crosses himself nedzadarek 10:59@greggirwin good points about using 2 syntaxes. none propagations sounds interesting. I think Lua none like values as well. Thank you for the response - I'll read more over the internet. 10:59@endo64 :+1: 11:01@rebolek I wish this was valid code: arr: [] arr/a: 1 ; [1]. rebolek 11:05@nedzadarek what is a in your code? toomasv 11:12@nedzadarek It is valid with map. rebolek 11:13but then you get #(a: 1). I'm not sure how it could result in just [1]. toomasv 11:19It is very simple :smile: >> arr: [] next body-of do [put arr: to-map arr 'a 1 arr] == [1] rebolek 11:20yeah, as simple as your last example :smirk: nedzadarek 12:35@rebolek My mistake... I meant arr: [] arr/a: 1 ; [a 1] or [a: 1] or in general [ ] @toomasv yes, m: #() m/a: 1 m; #(a: 1) is valid for maps. I wish that kind of things were valid for other series as well. rebolek 12:40@nedzadarek maps are orderless, but where do you want to put that a 1 in block? toomasv 13:00@nedzadarek I think it is a good thing different structures work in specific ways (to certain extent). Otherwise, why have different structures? nedzadarek 13:25@rebolek I think it does not matter in this case. I mean you are using a block! as key-value container. You want one key to point to only one value. You do not want to have repeated keys (for example: [a: 1 a: 2]). There are 2 cases: - a key exists - you just change value - a key does not exist - you add key-value pair ps. I assuming that keys are not integers @toomasv Yes, it is good to have different structures but I do not think raising an error on non-existent "key" is a good thing. It is not a rocket science to use put (or other techniques) so it is not very important. It is just the set syntax makes code more readable. rebolek 13:26@nedzadarek but block! is not key/value storage. 13:27it can be used as one, but that's not its primary purpose nedzadarek 13:29@rebolek yes, but it is multi-purpose container. The Red has map! but in the Rebol it was used more frequently as key-value container. Oldes 15:16@nedzadarek sorry, but everyone want to have [a: 1 a: 2] as a valid block! If you don't want it, than you have serious misunderstanding of Redbol languages, where code is data. rebolek 15:21:+1: Oldes 15:22@toomasv I would optimise your code a little bit: select-or-return-error: func [series value /local pos][ either pos: find series value [ second pos ][ cause-error 'user 'message ["Value does not exist in series!"] ] ] rebolek 15:26but then you are not using path notation :smile: Oldes 15:39I just had to react when I was seeing find series value and select series value on second line:) I would not use such a code. And understand that it was meant just as an example. toomasv 15:56@Oldes :+1: Well, mine was meant as highly-optimised-to-use-in-production-code, but you found a way to optimise it even more! 9214 15:58@toomasv not quite so - you forgot semantic versioning. toomasv 15:58Ah, yes, sorry meijeru 16:28The latest commit https://github.com/red/red/commit/06ddce9e888b6a5988b9bf5c62b19b4c4023e6bb on master has revealed the following feature: if none of the case alternatives is matched, the result is a run-time error. OTH an unmatched if and an unmatched switch without /default give none. This has presumably always been the case, and it is no doubt a design decision. For ifit seems unavoidable. For switch the analogy with case is apparently less strong than that with successive ifs. nedzadarek 16:37@Oldes I don't mean that the block! or any other series should have such limitations (only one set-word! with the same name). I mean syntax for "setting" some values in a (at least) block. meijeru 16:43@nedzadarek What about insert, append and change? You can use them with an argument which is a block of two. Thus: arr: [ ] insert arr [a 1] ; arr == [a 1] 16:48That would be my alternative for arr/a: 1 nedzadarek 16:49@meijeru I have already posted [the answer](https://gitter.im/red/red?at=5bec224f7326df140e04a746): > It is not a rocket science to use put (or other techniques) so it is not very important. It is just the set syntax makes code more readable. toomasv 16:59@meijeru Can you elaborate? That's what I see with latest build (06ddce9e): >> a: 1 b: 2 case [a = 2 []] == none >> case [] == none 9214 16:59@meijeru you're talking about R/S case. meijeru 17:01Yes, I should have put this remark in red/system room, and pointed out that in this sense, Red case and Red/System case behave differently. 9214 17:04But then you've confused both if and switch, which don't return none (because it doesn't exists as datatype) in Red/System (and switch doesn't even have any refinements). meijeru 17:06Forget about if and switch then. The important thing remains the different behaviour of case. 9214 17:08Which is justifiable, because Red and Red/System are different languages with totaly different semantics. meijeru 17:13@nedzadarek For blocks, extraction by path works like select except if the "key" value is an integer, because then it works like pick. Furthermore their counterparts poke and put are allowed on blocks, and put DOES add the "key/value pair" if it does not exist. But pokedoes not allow indexes out of range. So it seems that a path syntax like you request, would be feasible for "key" values that are not integers. If you feel strong enough about it, you might make a wish in REP. 17:14@9214 Quite right, and therefore marginally worth documenting. nedzadarek 17:33@meijeru I will think about it. To be honest I think I only needed once such feature. I could not use map! because it does not allow collections as keys: https://github.com/nedzadarek/Red-Memoi/blob/master/main.red#L19 Oldes 20:18> @Oldes I don't mean that the block! or any other series should have such limitations (only one set-word! with the same name). I mean syntax for "setting" some values in a (at least) block. @nedzadarek as was already mentioned, map! is the datatype you probably need. >> m: make map! [] m/a: 1 m == #( a: 1 ) >> to block! m == [a: 1] 20:31But to be honest, I don't know what you need... I have big problems to read and understand your code. nedzadarek 21:12@Oldes as I have said already, map! doesn't support collections as keys: m: #() m/(to-paren [1 2]): 1 *** Script Error: paren! type is not allowed here. Oldes 21:17My main problem probably is, why you want to use paren! as a key. To me it looks very inefficient. Sorry, cannot help you with it. 21:23@nedzadarek what about this? >> b: [[1 2] "foo"] select/only b [1 2] == "foo" 21:24 >> b: [(1 2) "foo"] select/only b quote (1 2) == "foo" nedzadarek 21:25@Oldes b: [[1 2] "foo"] b/([1 2]) I don't need help - I have done it already. I was explaining why I needed. Oldes 21:29You are bad explainer than. As I'm now lost. I fought you wanted b: [] b/a: 1 to give you b = [a 1]. Never mind... better things to do here. nedzadarek 21:29It was for memoization - storing result of functions. I need to store function call (e.g. random/only [1 2 3]) . So there are 2 way to store it that I can think of: - change [random/only [1 2 3] into some number/string - store it into some collection, for example block!, map!, paren! etc. map! won't let me do this, and I have chosen paren! just because it looks nice. 21:32@Oldes about b: [] b/a: 1 => yes, I was just showing where I couldn't use map. greggirwin 21:39> c/(either find c 'x ['x][cause-error 'user 'message ["Oops!"]]) @toomasv is going to the dense side. =:^@ nedzadarek 21:41@greggirwin why not just c/x instead of find c 'x? 21:43I assume that non-existent key-value ([] -> no 'a' key) is equal none value ([a: none]). greggirwin 21:47The path syntax won't tell you the difference between a key existing or not, while find does. Assuming that none for the value is equal to a non-existent key is not safe, as a general rule. nedzadarek 21:49I see. greggirwin 21:51Path syntax for setting a value, where the key doesn't exist, sounds nice at a glance, and there is an argument (loudly discussed in the 90s) about *exactly* consistent interfaces for different structures and types. Again, it comes down to tradeoffs. Most importantly, it comes down to design and what we find works best in a language. A similar problem exists for hiding network access, as in DCOM. Changing from local to remove, or from linked-list to array, where the details are hidden, can have enormous effects. Those are surprises you don't want. So we have to strike a balance between what we need to know and do explicitly, what the different interfaces tell us about intent, and making things safe and easy. 21:57It's a key feature that set-word! values are an atomic element, used for "assignment". This isn't obvious, but it's important. Paths are one of our most complex (and powerful) types, and effects can ripple out. On the point of keys in blocks, remember that find/select do *not* treat the block as *pairs* of values. You need to use /skip 2 for that. Then consider /only. For set-path! syntax, should that be implied? Because you're then making the key-value pair structure implicit. And while it works well for words (the common case), will it look as nice for other values? The point is not to shoot down new ideas, but to stress test them and think them through. Then we need to keep a record of ideas that have been rejected, or they'll come up again and again. 21:59As much as the onus is on those proposing new ideas to show why they're good, the onus is also on those against them to show why they're bad. Thursday 15th November, 2018 lucindamichele 06:49A suggestion to remember that ad hominem attacks, or jabs at the mental faculties of others, degrade the quality of the discussion here. They are powerfully counterproductive to the calm, dispassionate evaluation of code. nedzadarek 11:10@greggirwin > For set-path! syntax, should that be implied? Because you're then making the key-value pair structure implicit. And while it works well for words (the common case), will it look as nice for other values? Am I really implying something? I mean, except integers, getting values are based on key-value pair structure. And for integers: yes, we cannot just , for example, arr: [] append [999 'v] because it is not a "sparse array". While it will work with, for example, select, it won't work with path syntax (arr/999). > Then consider /only. For set-path! syntax So for non-integers: Key should be added "as-is" (with /only, e.g. paren as paren). Syntax for retrieving values doesn't support retrieving multiple values so why set-syntax should? Unless there is a plan for getting multiple values (e.g arr: [11 22 33 44] and arr/([1 3]) would return [11 33]) set-syntax shouldn't support setting multiple keys. Values should be added with the same patterns as when a key exists. ps. of course it sounds (at least to me) good but I don't know how everything is implemented/connected. Such change may change some behaviour that I couldn't think of (the butterfly effect). endo64 16:39@nedzadarek you can add your wish/proposal to red/rep repo then we can move the conversation to comments there to not let them flow away here on gitter. meijeru 16:57I had already suggested that. The reaction was: "@meijeru I will think about it. To be honest I think I only needed once such feature." Personally, I think it deserves a REP entry for serious consideration. greggirwin 17:26+1 nedzadarek 21:07@endo64 @meijeru then I will move to that repo but I have question (I will ask in red/help room). Friday 16th November, 2018 9214 05:22Can anyone tell me why are we seriously considering to mangle block! and path! to act like map!..? dsunanda 08:56Maybe we are envious of the freedom the Ren-C people have in gutting Rebol's architecture :) meijeru 09:38May I remind you that , in general, the following equivalence holds (see the specs document, section 5.6.2): put <==> /: . Now, if is a block, and the is not found, put will _add_ the combination, but the path expression will _not_. This asymmetry is presumably intentional, but certainly open for discussion. 9214 09:50@dsunanda everyone would appreciate if you'd stay on topic. 09:51@meijeru good point. IMO whole any-path! design deserves a thoughtful discussion. nedzadarek 09:52@9214 When a map! does not allow you to use certain values as keys and you have to use a block!. And with a block! you have to use "longer syntax" (https://gitter.im/red/red?at=5bee90101665691e0fb11a73). If you need more info then ask on red/chit-chat as they suggested to make an adoc in the red/rep repository. 9214 09:53@nedzadarek and what this has to do with your initial proposal? nedzadarek 09:53@9214 let me explain in chit-chat 9214 09:55You said that block/key: value should create a new key/value entry instead of raising an error, but I don't see a single argument about why an error is a bad thing and your suggestion is better. Instead you started to talk about map keys for some reason. 10:23> I do not think raising an error on non-existent "key" is a good thing Perhaps you should've started by explaining to us why you don't think that this is a good thing, and why you think it should be the way you suggest. Otherwise it all sounds like "Red doesn't let me do things the way I want to, so it should be changed". meijeru 11:05On a totally different topic: I made a list of all globally defined words, and reviewed that carefully, amongst others against the list in section 14 of the specs document. I came up with a considerable number of words that can be thought of as "leakages", whose inadvertent redefinition could be damaging. Many of these words are for functions that have doc-string"Internal use only". Should these leaked words not be protected by context? Is there interest in the full list? Example: common-substr. 12:11@dockimbel @qtxie One result from the above investigation: in system/lexer/transcode, the following words should be made local: date-sep, time-sep, not-tag-1st so that they don't leak. qtxie 12:37@meijeru Thanks. I'll make them local. 12:38> Should these leaked words not be protected by context? Is there interest in the full list? Of course. That would be very useful. meijeru 13:09See here the list. When "Internal use only", this has been noted. From looking at the sources, I do not understand why cancel-captions and fstk-logo came to be global. Leaking words in %environment/console/auto-complete.red common-substr Internal use only has-common-part? red-complete-file Internal use only red-complete-path Internal use only red-complete-input Internal use only in %environment/console/GUI/settings.red fstk-logo in %modules/view/backends/macOS/rules.red in %modules/view/backends/windows/rules.red cancel-captions in %modules/view/view.red debug-info? Internal use only do-safe Internal use only link-sub-to-parent Internal use only link-tabs-to parent Internal use only in %environment/routines.red last-lf? Internal use only 16:09Question: why is there no compress function as counterpart to decompress? 9214 16:12@meijeru IIRC it is marked as TBD, and requires some final polishing of Redbin. 16:13Though, I'm probably speculating here. rebolek 16:31Redbin would be wonderful, syntax-free language! Imagine writing Red in emojis only! 16:32would...will! 9214 16:40Who are you and what you did to @rebolek? 16:42@9214 did you do* rebolek 17:23You were not paying attention to my presentation. 17:24Red is in-memory language, syntax is second class citizen. 9214 17:25Ah, you mean this. greggirwin 17:57> @dsunanda everyone would appreciate if you'd stay on topic. @9214, the occasional sarcastic remark is acceptable. @dsunanda is a long time Reboler and has no ill intent. meijeru 20:41@greggirwin Is there a reason why parse-func-spec in %help.red is global? greggirwin 21:23@meijeru the reason is that I forgot to capture it in the outer context. Thanks. Open a ticket, and I'll fix it. 21:24That is, an inner context exports it for use in the outer context, using set, and it leaked from that. meijeru 21:27I thought as much. See #3590 21:29I am also puzzled about fetch-help and help-string. 21:30They are identical, and should they (or one of them?) be global?? 21:31 >> :help-string = :fetch-help == true greggirwin 22:12fetch-help was the old name. But intentionally exported. set 'fetch-help :help-string ; alias for VS Code plug while it still uses the old name loziniak 22:13Hi! Is this possible to compile RED Wallet for Android? I saw Android demo video and it was quire impressing. If not, would it be much work for a good developer? greggirwin 22:20@loziniak not at this time. The Android branch needs to be caught up, but if you are, or know, a good developer, it should be doable with some guidance (and much appreciated). 22:21The USB drivers for the wallet might be the trickiest, but @qtxie would have to say, as compared to Linux. loziniak 22:24I think I could try and find out if I'm good enough ;-) If it was a week or two, that's within my time reach. 22:27I already spoke to qtxie, he said requirement on USB devices could be avoided with the use of a secp256k1 C library. But again, it's Android so probably getting this library to work could be a problem. 22:30Probably I could also try to get Walet to work on Linux/GTK3 greggirwin 22:36GTK support is only partial at this point, but we've got a CLI version on our planned feature list, which would make it usable on Linux. loziniak 22:41I remember compiling Red from GTK branch and the demo app seemed to work well :-) And from what I've seen, Wallet's UI is not very complicated. 22:48Who I need to contact about the Android branch? qtxie 23:52@loziniak The Android branch is private for now. Saturday 17th November, 2018 loziniak 13:02Strange for an open-source project. Does it mean I can't help? 9214 13:22@loziniak nothing strange at all; a bit of secrecy and careful release timing won't hurt anyone. loziniak 13:22It hurts me. 9214 13:24How? pekr 13:26Badly? :-) loziniak 13:28I have a project with deadline. And decided to depend on RED Wallet, which I hoped could meet my needs after giving it some love. If you plan to release Android branch in a month, that's no problem for me. But if not, I probably will start to search for other solutions. pekr 13:30My guess is, that Android version is not going to be available in a month, but can't speak for Red team, nor do I have any inside info on that .... 9214 13:31So, what hurts you is actually your deadline and your choice to depend on someone who actually doesn't owe you anything. "Open-source" doesn't mean that we are obliged to inform everyone about all aspects of development, or give insights in business matters; it means that you can join us and share our struggle to meet desired goals, at any time. 13:35No one's gonna put current roadmap away and jump to help you fulfill your project obligations just because you expressed a demand for it. loziniak 13:37At what point I demanded something? Stop being rude and let's just close the subject. 13:43Obviously not always "open-source" means also "open". I carelessly mad that assumption with Red :-) 9214 13:45I don't see nipping teh drama in the bud as being rude. loziniak 13:48Obviously. BeardPower 14:05@loziniak "Open Source" does not mean that everything a company develops has to be released. Once it's released, it will be released under an Open Source license. loziniak 14:06I know what open source means, please let's stop the subject. BeardPower 14:06Well, if you do, than why make assumptions in the first place? ;-) pekr 14:06Vladimir - I too think there is no need for a drama. I believe that on Maciej's part, it is just something like - what a pity it is not available now, so hence it is not a criticism on his part, imo :-) 14:08I think that in the end we all wish Red already overtaking the world. Well, some of us wish just that since the times of the mighty Amiga :-) BeardPower 14:10@pekr Situation clarified, Case closed :-) loziniak 14:13To be honest, It was a criticism. I'm not going to be sorry for that. 9214 14:18Are you criticizing the existence of private projects? Mmkay. loziniak 14:38@9214 prv. 9214 17:22@loziniak I'm answering to you publicly, as it raises an important point. We put emphasis on means to sustain the project, as this is the most important thing to do at this stage of development, because barely anyone wants Red to be a stillborn child with Rebol's failure woven in its fate. Planning in this way requires some trade-offs and raises some obligations — "closeness" and marketing are one of them. We are closed to the degree we want to secure Red, and it is obvious that the most sensitive parts of the project are isolated — not because we want to shut off contributors, but because we want to survive, and surviving requires some degree of secrecy. People don't walk around naked with their hearts wide open — so do we, so as any other open-source project who wants to be successful. It doesn't mean that we won't let you or anyone else being involved (and it never is or was the case), it just means that you should be responsible and qualified enough to contribute to something that we deem especially important. And sometimes we just don't need help (or think that we don't need). 17:28In case with Android branch and Wallet app - you are most welcomed to contribute to them, and no one stops you from contacting team and offering your help. @qtxie and @bitbegin can fill you in on Wallet side, while Android branch at some point will be opened for early contributors who can bring valuable additions, feature requests and bug fixes - if you're one of them, let @greggirwin know. loziniak 17:53Thanks. I'll keep my opinion for myself or for private talks. Secrecy about Android branch will probably force me to seek for another solution and I'll be too busy to help. greggirwin 19:30To clarify and close the topic, it's all a balancing act. @loziniak as you likely know, FOSS is hard, and opening things up early can lead to extra effort managing people who want to help (who may or may not be qualified or truly committed), and a risk of design by committee. To get a project rolling, it often works best to get it to a certain point before opening it up. Open Source is a double-edged sword. And we're human. When you spend all your time working on something, making it freely available to people, and they say "That's not enough.", it's frustrating. The blame is not with you, or with us, but with how easy it is to miscommunicate. We appreciate you wanting to help, truly, and we want to be open, and open-minded as much as possible. Just not so much that our brains fall out. Sunday 18th November, 2018 ldci 10:53Neural network with Red language here: http://redlcv.blogspot.com/2018/ meijeru 11:08I just discovered https://w.red-lang.org. Looks very polished. Question: how is it positioned? What is its relationship to https://beta.red-lang.org? Oldes 11:19Looks very nice, indeed. I should just mention, that the content of _published contributions_ should be updated as most of the are outdated. Some of them (Kaj's) even not compatible anymore. 11:21If I can choose, I prefer the first link. meijeru 11:50A few remarks on the w. site: the blog is running behind, and the blog entries are not dated; the about section has some curious links (details available); the help section is presumably there to enable people to contribute - it transpires only later in the text that they should be using vue.js (?) and there is no information about gaining access. That said, I still like it, and look forward to these shortcomings being repaired. Still, the question about the beta site have not been anwered. 12:02Please tell me to whom to send my detailed remarks. greggirwin 17:51@x8x did that, and it's a translation of the current site. I really like it, too, but we're committed to giving the new sites a shot, and getting content in there will be a priority once 0.6.4 is officially released. Monday 19th November, 2018 lepinekong_twitter 04:32@rebolek returning none for an non-existing property is like returning none for a non-existing variable: for validation it sucks you have to add a lot of code to ensure that datas passed are valid for example. 04:33On about page https://www.red-lang.org/p/about.html there is "Concurrency and parallelism strong support (actors, parallel collections)" did I miss something because I can't see where or how :) 04:49@rebolek apart from pure functional business cases, I doubt a security auditor would allow such lack of control for a language to be used in a corporate enterprise. Security is becoming a huge topic since one year. rebolek 06:45@lepinekong_twitter returning none is very convenient and people were actually adding lot of boilerplate code to have none instead of error!. You don't need to add a lot of code to check for member's existence, you just need to use right function for the job, eg.: find. I agree that security is a huge topic, but this has nothing to do with security. Red is very secure in this manner, you just need to use right functions for the job. Like when you want to tighten the Phillips screw with flat screwdriver - it's possible, but when you break the screw, it's your fault that you've chosen wrong type of screwdriver. pekr 08:39@lepinekong_twitter coming late to the discussion - what lack of control and how is that a security related? 08:41I am a corporate guy, working with audits by the "big four", being part of security teams. I have never ever heard any of auditors objecting to the tools used. BeardPower 14:24@lepinekong_twitter I don't get your point. It's like stating that a security auditor would not suggest using C because it utilizes the concept of NULL. 14:25Security was always a huge topic in serious companies and not only since one year. 14:31@pekr Me neither. It's all about the usage of these tools. You can create crappy/insecure code with any language. This reminds me of people thinking they would become great artists just by using the same tools like their big idols. pekr 14:46What audits do care about is - policies. They want you to check patch/update policy or similar one is in place. Well, deep IT audits might be more tough, I am mostly part of a financial one, so it usually does not go so deep. You can have best firewall in the world, but if you set-up it incorrectly ... then any tool can get as secure as is its user's abilities to set it up properly :-) Anyway - we are kind of off-topic here. BeardPower 15:09Exactly: policy <> execution meijeru 21:22I notice all issues with milestone 0.6.4 are changed to 0.6.5. Does that mean that release 0.6.4 is imminent? greggirwin 21:41Yes. 21:41If you consider any of them showstoppers, let me know. Tuesday 20th November, 2018 virtualAlan 00:59Hi, regarding the false positives - I create an exe with red and there's avg, avira, defender and others flagging viruses or trojans - what's the answer ? 01:03programs/apps created with Red should be seen as clean, otherwise whats the point ? 01:22It's all very well writing/posting scripts/code and that's good, but surely the ultimate aim is to have developers use Red to produce compiled commercial apps - This AV problem aint good. Apologies, am pretty fed up with this AV crap. greggirwin 02:24@virtualAlan so are we. The problem is on their end. We don't have enough power to make them listen. BeardPower 11:01Unfortunately. A solution would be to release our own OS: full control over everything. planetsizecpu 11:15@BeardPower +1 I hope to live long enough to see it with my own eyes, of course running on The Mill :-) BeardPower 11:20@planetsizecpu Me too. I wrote down a spec with hardware to use and many ideas. Now is the time for change :smile: ericguedespinto 12:46@ldci Really nice implementation. Impressive to see a full neural network sample in just over 250 LOC I tried to tinker with it, but I couldn't change the presets like number of hidden neurons. These are hardcoded in the view code button "Run Network" [makeNetwork 2 3 1 0.5 0.1 makeTraining ] but when I tried to generalize this call, like button "Run Network" [makeNetwork nInput nHidden nOutput learningRate momentumFactor makeTraining ] and then change nHidden from the top of the file, I get an error *** Script Error: path cOutput/:j/:k is not valid for none! type *** Where: * *** Stack: do-file view do-events do-actor do-safe makeTraining trainNetwork backPropagation It only seems to work with 2 input, 3 hidden and 1 output neurons. Why would that be? mikeparr 13:26Re the Mini RedCon'18 page on red-lang.org. I'm assuming there will be a follow-up page describing what went on there? If not, perhaps the original page could be edited? Looking forward to reading about it.. rebolek 13:29Yeah, hopefully someone will get to write something about it :) x8x 14:59In the meantime you can watch the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFX9pQd22w (thx to @endo64) ldci 15:23@ericguedespinto : thanks but I've to improve for the generalization of the number of neurons rebolek 16:30@x8x ah, cool! Thanks @endo64! I still need to get the slides to get my videos out, because of the cam placement. ldci 16:43@ericguedespinto Bug corrected and blog updated (http://redlcv.blogspot.com/2018/). I made an error in CreateMatrices func. So you can modified the number of hidden neurons without any problems. There are no problems with the number of input or output neurons, but in this case you have to modify the pattern to be learned. Truth tables for Boolean operators used in the code correspond to 2 inputs and 1 output. Regards ericguedespinto 17:00@ldci thanks greggirwin 21:29@mikeparr blog post is pending final review. I still need to get my slides up as well.

Ideas wait to be implemented :smile: TheHowdy_gitlab 14:16I remember some time ago quoting was implemented for op!, but with the latest build, this doesn't work: >> !!: make op! function [a 'b][print ["Got" a "and" b]] == make op! [[a 'b]] >> a: 1 b: 2 == 2 >> a !! b ; I expect "Got 1 and b here" Got 1 and 2 Am I doing something wrong? 14:17Well, ah, this would be rather suited for /help I guess... 9214 14:31@TheHowdy_gitlab yeah, I noticed this some time ago but forgot about the issue. It seems that quotation (or absence of it) applied to the first argument automatically expands to the second one. >> !!: make op! func [a :b][print ["Got" a "and" b]] == make op!

I think somebody implemented currying - it would help in this case. 9214 14:53@TheHowdy_gitlab I used [this](https://github.com/9214/daruma/blob/master/src/utils.red#L64) for simple function chaining (e.g. [here](https://github.com/9214/daruma/blob/master/src/decoder.red#L15)). nedzadarek 14:55 @9214 :+1: nice function. TheHowdy_gitlab 14:56@nedzadarek True. Hm.. And maybe this variant is more "natural" to red syntax anyway. @9214 then is actually pretty nice too. Thank you guys for the great input :thumbsup: 9214 15:01@TheHowdy_gitlab you can also step aside from op! entirely and take a different approach: chain: func [body /local .][ bind body '. get/any also '. until [ set/any '. do/next body 'body empty? body ] ] chain [1 multiply 2 . sqrt . print .] TheHowdy_gitlab 15:24@9214 I'm experimenting with a mini-dsl approach as well, yes.

It's called Monsoon ;-) 18:55At least the current crypto situation feels like it. 18:55But yay, next stop: 0.7.0 x8x 23:19Windows users please have your say on this issue https://github.com/red/red/issues/3602 Thursday 22nd November, 2018 BlairLW 15:53Hello. just discovered red lang. never heard of rebol until now. looking to learn to be a professional developer and make UIs and scripting. I can code barely nontrivial C programs on command line. Should I start with red? rebolek 15:56Welcome @BlairLW ! Red's certainly easier to get into than C, especially if you are interested in UIs and scripting. Download Red, experiment in the console and don't be afraid to ask here, there's always someone willing to help. endo64 15:57Welcome @BlairLW of course you can start with Red, there are many learning stuff, they are not well organized yet but you can always ask your questions on /welcome or /help rooms. 15:58With minor differences Red is compatible with Rebol, that's why we refer Rebol docs sometimes. BlairLW 15:59I'll take that as a "yes". Thanks lpvm 16:02@BlairLW You can read and practice starting at http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore.html and get inspired by one of Nick Antonnacio's tutorials, like http://business-programming.com/business_programming.html BlairLW 16:17thx. I hope to be making useful ui and clicking apps soon 16:17*command line nedzadarek 17:16@greggirwin thank you for the link BlairLW 17:55Does red-lang have anything similar the "writing without code" tutorial? 17:55Is the 95% compat statement pretty accurate? That is, it's ok to use the REBOL site in order to learn the language and make some decent UIs? 17:56then come back to red-lang? 18:01Why does it take over two minutes to compile "hello.red" 18:02However, making a change, and then recompiling only took a few seconds. gltewalt 18:23I think the 95% is fairly accurate. For you, since it looks like you’re interested in UIs to start with, their are some small but important differences. However, View and VID is pretty well documented for Red - see here: https://doc.red-lang.org/en/gui.html 18:26If you use REBOL tutorials and such, you can look here for the differences: https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BLINKS%5D-Coming-from-REBOL 18:34This might be a good Red guide for you: http://helpin.red/ 18:36Particularly the GUI section. http://helpin.red/GUI.html 9214 18:56@BlairLW > Does red-lang have anything similar the "writing without code" tutorial? Not sure what you mean by that. We have plenty of learning material accumulated in [this](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/[LINKS]-Learning-resources) wiki page though. > Is the 95% compat statement pretty accurate? Yes, its pretty accurate, however learning Red and learning how to make decent UIs with Red/View are totaly different things. > Why does it take over two minutes to compile "hello.red" What takes 2 minutes is compilation of Red runtime library; on subsequent invocations only newly added user code is compiled. See [here](https://www.red-lang.org/2017/03/062-libred-and-macros.html). greggirwin 19:28DevCon blog post up: https://www.red-lang.org/2018/11/redcon-1-and-ethereum-devcon-4-world.html 19:32On compilation, because we build things in the order we need them (at any given moment), fast rebuilds for release are still slow. To really speed that up requires modules and modular compilation, which are significant work. The libRed solution lets you iterate rapidly during development, but is not the final solution. 19:35It's also heavily machine dependent, especially if you have a laptop trying to save power. Full builds take ~40s for me. Still not fast, but not as painful as 2m. rebolek 20:37:clap: toomasv 20:46:+1: Friday 23th November, 2018 amreus 00:24@BlairLW If your code is pure Red as opposed to Red/System then you are not required to compile it just to test run the code. You can run it on the command line with red --cli script.red BlairLW 00:51Thanks for the time and information guys. I'm building my reading list. nedzadarek 00:58:clap: Great - I will have something to watch. @amreus @BlairLW on the Windows (not sure about other languages) you can make files with certain extensions runnable by the Red. Somebody mentioned Rebolcore - I still use it for non-gui programming. A gui programming is little different. You may understand basics of the Red's gui's programming but you have to learn differences. I'm porting some gui code from the Rebol - the new Red code looks different. I'm not very good with guis so take it with the grain of salt. BlairLW 02:29this is from the rebol app ui builder: I put this into a button: <begin> [BTN1: btn "write to" [write/append %more.txt "more text" ] ] <end> I found this temp path (C:\Users\declan\AppData\Local\Temp\IXP000.TMP) I touched/created the file more.txt there figuring it would write there. I push the button, and it doesn't error, but it also doesn't seem to write the file at the directory above, or to the directory from which the exe was launched. Any ideas ? Thanks. gltewalt 02:44If you’re in the console type what-dir. That will tell you what directory you’re in by default. To write to more.txt without qualifying the directory or changing the directory, make sure more.txt exists in directory returned by what-dir 02:46Also, make use of the red/help room for quicker responses BlairLW 02:58Thanks. planetsizecpu 10:11Great article! I will watch the whole video on weekend, by the way I have seen, all people looks well and healty 😃 rebolek 11:29Well I had fever and certainly wasn't healthy at all. pekr 12:18Great article. But there's also some worrying implications, namely in the footnotes section .... x8x 12:19@rebolek Stop with that! You look very ok and your presentation sounds great! Pity can't see the projection, maybe with your coming video :smiley: 12:19@pekr What's wrong with the footnotes? pekr 12:25The state of the Ethereum ecosystem and its potential stability .... 12:26I am just trying to think about it positively though. While some players might be partially hyped, maybe it is a good chance for Red/C3 to take off ... we will see ... greggirwin 17:33Aha! So it was @rebolek that gave it to us. ;^) 17:34It's a crazy space to be in @pekr, but not our only play. We intend to deliver all we've said we would, but have to be honest about our concerns as well. rebolek 17:50@greggirwin if you caught the flu, I am very sorry, my wife begged my not to go, but then - well - there wouldn't be the RedCon... greggirwin 17:55It was worth it. Thanks for suffering through for us. rebolek 17:57It was a pleasure. ericguedespinto 18:05Really nice to see the new post. Any chance we can get our hands in the presentations’ materials (powerpoints, code snippets...) greggirwin 18:06@eric, yes, we're working on things now. 2 PPTs are ready, but we're talking about the best format for posting them. Soon. ericguedespinto 18:08@greggirwin thanks ;) great work 9214 18:09@greggirwin you forgot :tm: after "Soon". rebolek 18:09@greggirwin If you're not sure what format to use... https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png greggirwin 18:10@toomasv probably wrote a PPT to DRAW tool while we were chatting. rebolek 18:11@greggirwin I'm fine with PPT, I just need it to edit videos. greggirwin 18:16We just want to make sure they're easy for anyone to view. x8x 19:11For presentation, slideshow, etc.. haven't decided which one is better of the three, please have a look https://www.notion.so/redlang/Slides-6f42c297ea0a4f469561f4966f33f82e gltewalt 19:19Whichever takes the least amount of steps BeardPower 19:19Eagle.js looks very nice. x8x 19:22WebSlides look more powerful but more complicate, Remark is Markdown based and looks easy, Eagle, being VueJS based has the advantage of being easier to integrate (embed in docs or blog posts after being used in a presentation). hiiamboris 19:52why not pdf? dander 20:03Thanks to everyone who contributed to the presentation. I was really happy to see all of you together :smiley: lucindamichele 22:57> @eric, yes, we're working on things now. 2 PPTs are ready, but we're talking about the best format for posting them. Soon. I'm converting them today. :) greggirwin 23:47Means I need to get you mine soon, and even then I'll be late. Sunday 25th November, 2018 lepinekong_twitter 06:24Most of you must be scripting or admin guys so unlike application developers you don't need 80% validating datas for complex business rules. rebolek 06:32Validating data in Red is pretty easy, if you know how. And no, I'm no scripter nor admin. ne1uno 07:194 out of 5 is good? no wonder we get a breach of the month from fortune 500's 07:25*nobody believes serious companies settle for 80% validity. rebolek 07:284 of 5? What do you mean? ne1uno 07:294*20 is 80, that's the 80% ratio rebolek 07:30I'm lost. ne1uno 07:32100%/5=20 so 4 out of 5 is another way of saying 80 percent rebolek 07:34I understand that part, but I don't know what these number mean. 4 what of 5 what? 80% of what? ne1uno 07:434 out of 5 tests, 80 out of 100 addresses. whatever is being validated? we know there will be errors and bugs, but who aims for 80 percent? (I know we pfobably won't get an answer too) rebolek 07:44Oh sorry, I missed that number in @lepinekong_twitter's post. BeardPower 11:53@lepinekong_twitter I'm not just only one of your "target" audiences either. I can assure you that these target audiences are aiming for 100%, not 80%. I have no clue how you came up with this number. pekr 12:07Not sure this whole chat belongs into a Red channel though .... spTorin 13:52Can't find changelog for 0.6.4... Give me link please Oldes 14:320.6.4 was not officialy released yet.. so you must look at git commits to look what is new and what is fixed. 14:34@lepinekong_twitter what are co.plex business rules and what data you need to validate? I don't see any reason why you shoyld not be able to validate any data. If you choose right metod. Ungaretti 15:40I updated [Rededitor](http://helpin.red/Rededitor.html) today to version 1.1. It now has also two compile buttons, for -r and -c options. meijeru 15:53I see movement on Trello. Good! Because that was sort of dormant. One particular move gives rise to comment: The task "Find a better literal form for hexadecimals (see #1079) " seems supserseded by the new literal form for the hex! type. Monday 26th November, 2018 TheHowdy_gitlab 20:57Some probably stupid question: Whats the point of hex! if we have binary! (which is displayed as hex anyway)? meijeru 21:12As regards structure, binary! is a series of bytes, and hex! is an atomic type whose values are sequences of hex-digits (half-bytes). As regards usage, hex! values serve mostly for identification purposes or as hexadecimal encoding of a (large) positive number. 21:15I use the terms series and sequence to stress the difference - hex! values do not have components. 21:17Anyway, all this is my conclusion from reading the first code snippets dealing with hex! I have no inside information about this. TheHowdy_gitlab 21:34Ok, I kinda got it, but which "identification purposes" are you talking about? And what are the advantages over binary! (I mean, it's clearly different, but any noticable advantages in any areas)? 9214 21:37@TheHowdy_gitlab hex! belongs to number!, which kinda suggest that you can use all related actions on hex! values, which are unavailable for binary! (e.g. binary shifts, arithmetic). 21:39It's a byproduct of C3 development, as we need some datatype to represent account addresses. meijeru 21:46Indeed, the contract number for the Red Community Token (RED) is 0x76960dccd5a1fe799f7c29be9f19ceb4627aeb2f which will in future be recognized as a hex! literal. These values are stored in the same way as bigint! values (which themselves have no literals) and share the "big integer" operations with them. Tuesday 27th November, 2018 Phryxe 11:24Started to look at the RedCon3 video. Watched 40 minutes and I will continue later. A tip - you could add direct links to the different parts of the 3 hour long video to enable for the viewers to quickly jump to a selected part of the presentation. rebolek 11:28@Phryxe If I will ever get the slides, I will release recording from my laptop, cut into separate talks. Phryxe 11:37@rebolek Looking forward to it Oldes 11:40@Phryxe I'm now on 51 minutes ;-) I'm not sure if it is good idea to wait.. there is still hanging the big _IF..._ rebolek 11:47Right. I will at least record my terminal session during the weekend and release my talk, so you can laugh at my shitty presentation. x8x 12:14@Phryxe That's a great idea, contributions welcome! :smiley: jeffmikels 20:59Red sounds really cool. I'm wondering if it might be good for my application, but I need support for audio devices. Does red have an API for audio devices? 9214 22:06@jeffmikels what audio devices? What platform? We don't have any audio support out of the box, but, depending on the task, you can write your own API bindings / drivers. BeardPower 22:54@jeffmikels Audio support is on the to-do list, though. 9214 22:54https://gitter.im/red/audio Wednesday 28th November, 2018 NjinN 01:24@jeffmikels Try the winmm.dll on Windows? planetsizecpu 07:12@Ungaretti Good job! I want to test it as soon I have time Ungaretti 07:16@planetsizecpu :smiley: :thumbsup: pekr 13:21Sorry for an uneducated questions, but - I can see the new hex! and bigint! datatypes coming and might have some questions - 1) What is going to be the role of an issue! datatype from now on? Will further serve mostly for serial numbers, etc.? 2) What is the bigint! for? Mathematical stuff? Is that something different to BCD? (Most probably so, as BCD stands for Binary Coded Decimal, and bigint! is about big integers?) rebolek 13:22@pekr decimal vs integer. that's not hard to answer :) 9214 13:30@pekr 1. no one prescribes any "use-cases" to datatypes, so, one can use them at will, and no one stops you from using issue! to represent hexadecimals, if that fits some particular format or dialect. 1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic 13:34BCD is just an encoding. You can encode numbers with BCD and use arbitrary precision arithmetic on them, if you want. pekr 14:29OK, thanks. Maybe my question might be simpler. Couldn't just normal integer! handle bigint!? Or vice verse - can't you just express small arbitrary integers using biging!? 9214 14:36> Couldn't just normal integer! handle bigint!? They can't. The former is limited to the size of ALU registers, the latter is limited by the available memory of your system. ALU arithmetic is much faster, but can't handle big numbers. Arbitrary-precision arithmetic is slower, but the size of numbers is not an issue. > can't you just express small arbitrary integers using biging!? You can, but, as I said, two datatypes have different trade-offs. pekr 14:43ah, ALU, so HW dependant and hence compiler dependant .... OK, kind of got it, thanks ... dander 18:51Is there a description somewhere of the new types? I looked at the list of REPs, but didn't see them there, and couldn't find issues for them 9214 18:54Why everyone calls them "new types" when they are not even in master branch? dander 18:55what should we call them? We're just interested in the design process 18:59"gestating types"? 😉 I'm not asking for full documentation, just whether the design proposal is being recorded somewhere 9214 19:04Their development is dictated by the needs of C3 project, for the most part. hex! to represent contract addresses, bigint! to cater for EVM (idiotic) design decision to use 32 byte address space. No design proposals exist. rebolek 19:05I believe that bigint! would be useful for other things also. 9214 19:06Of course, I'm just pointing out the rationale. Thursday 29th November, 2018 meijeru 10:44I have been the one to alert others, in these rooms, about new developments that are visible for everyone, but not necessarily remarked by them. I am confident that the team will not put stuff in publicly visible branches that they don't want to be seen and discussed (yet). However, discussion on some visible new developments may also be felt as premature. Let's hear from the team, if they want. TheHowdy_gitlab 11:29Hm... system/script seems to not be implemented fully thus far. Can somebody reproduce the following: 1. Write the following into a file (test.red in my case): Red [title: "Oh, well"] probe system/script 2. Run it (tried both compiled and interpreted, on Win10) with some arguments 3. Result: make object! [ title: none header: none parent: none path: none args: "foo bar" ] Neither the title, nor the path have been set. Is it a bug or just a "not implemented yet"? rebolek 11:31not implemented yet endo64 11:32For the path, use system/options TheHowdy_gitlab 11:33@rebolek @endo64 Alright, thanks. rebolek 11:38@TheHowdy_gitlab you can easily fill the data with custom header loader, for example with load/all TheHowdy_gitlab 11:45@rebolek what do you mean by a "custom header loader"? 11:46Can't spot a difference between load and load/all rebolek 11:46@TheHowdy_gitlab if you do something like data: load/all %your-script.redthen header is in data/2 and you can use it to fill system/script 11:47Something like: >> load-header %test.red == [ #include %environment/console/CLI/input.red t: ask "Input name: " print t ] >> probe system/script make object! [ title: "Test script" header: [ Author: "Rebolek" Date: 29-Nov-2018 Title: "Test script" ] parent: none path: %/home/sony/Code/red/ args: none ] 11:48where load-header is a simple function: load-header: func [ file /local data header ][ data: load/all file header: second data system/script/title: select header 'title system/script/path: system/options/path system/script/header: header skip data 2 ] 11:49@TheHowdy_gitlab Ah, load loads all too, I thought it skips the header. Then there's no difference :smile: 11:50In Rebol, load skips the header, so it's safer to use load/all for loading header, because it would be probably changed in future to work like Rebol version. TheHowdy_gitlab 11:52@rebolek Ah, u are filling it manually, got it. And thanks for the hint. rebolek 12:00@TheHowdy_gitlab Right, manually for now, until Red does it automatically. giesse 17:45@rebolek in R2, load/header is what you want, not load/all. In Red load and load/header are the same right now. rebolek 17:51@giesse In R2 yes, but in Red, load/header is TBD, that's why I suggested load/all. I actually haven't checked that load/all is same as load in Red, I usually just do script. giesse 20:35I think that /all doesn't do anything right now, other than always return a block. But, in general, normal load would skip anything *before* the header, while I'm not sure if /all will in the future, so it would be more future proof to use load/header in this case. 20:36 unless :all [if 1 = length? out [out: out/1]] that's the only difference that /all makes right now as far as I can tell. lucindamichele 22:10@meijeru There's no reason I can't go back to doing weekly updates on new developments. The core devs were very busy with C3 & the wallet updates before Devcon, and have been understandably busy afterwards, so approvals for blog updates have been slow. meijeru 22:27@lucindamichele Thanks! I answered you in private chat. Friday 30th November, 2018 ericguedespinto 08:05Hello everybody! Did Red 0.6.4 just get released? rebolek 08:07@ericguedespinto not officially yet meijeru 08:08Nine days ago, the version.r file in the main repository was changed to read 0.6.4. There was no official announcement. I guess we are waiting for that, and hopefully it is accompanied by an explanation of the main improvements. 09:01Also, the latest red.exe download says version 0.6.4. when you do about. Saturday 1st December, 2018 spTorin 15:16Nenad's presentation from RedCon3 is in open access? 9214 15:17@spTorin not yet, we'll announce here once all presentations become available. spTorin 15:19Good. Just hard to see text on the screen in video. Monday 3th December, 2018 greggirwin 19:04On bigint! and hex!, and more generally, if things aren't in the master branch, they should be considered either experimental or required for other work in their host branch. If the team hasn't put things out for comment and design input, it's because the initial work is still being ironed out and isn't yet ready for that. The work on C3 and, as @9214 noted, the EVM design itself, present unique challenges; both at the literal form and implementation levels. Ethereum has an address type, in the form of 0x. That's what drove hex! to be considered as a literal form (with deep consideration about pair! syntax collisions). Bigint is for crypto calcs, and maybe used for other things. Much higher overhead and, like money! may need an EVM specific internal design in C3 that differs from Red proper. I hope that's enough to tide you over. It's too soon for general community involvement with them, but we'll keep you posted. amreus 21:57Could the libRedRT* files which are generated when using red -c be generated only once, and then copied instead of generated thus saving the time of generating multiple copies for each project directory? 22:04For some background, I like to use the most recent automated build. I also have projects in several directories. On my computer, the files take 2.5 - 3 minutes to generate. I just was thinking of ways to save time. If the libRedRT* files were generated only once per Red version, they could be stored in a shared location and then just copied where needed. qtxie 23:45@amreus libRedRT is project specific. Sometimes you have to use -u to generate it. In this case, the libRedRT is different from the "default" one. amreus 23:53Oh that's interesting. I have been copying the files manually which appears to work. Most of my scripts are "plain" Red, not Red/System - maybe that's why it works? Tuesday 4th December, 2018 greggirwin 01:14@amreus if you're not changing anything in the runtime, copying them is fine. But Red doesn't know (without doing a deep analysis) that your projects can safely share the runtime if they are in different locations. This could be another build option, but it comes with its own issues, and will require consideration. tmpbci 01:40Is it here someone (greg?) said something about a redis implementation in red ? rebolek 07:31@tmpbci I wrote [Redis protocol](https://github.com/rebolek/prot-redis) for Rebol3 and once TCP is working in Red, I will port it. And also try to improve it, because there's lot of new stuff in Redis, since I wrote that code. Ungaretti 08:26Who is the <COPYRIGHT HOLDER> of Red currently? The Red Foundation? rebolek 08:34Looking at sources it seems you're right. Ungaretti 08:45@rebolek Sources! Of course! I didn't think of looking there. duh. :thumbsup: rebolek 08:46 @Ungaretti And thaks to power of git blame, it's easy to find when it did happen https://github.com/red/red/commit/e0a31a954b223ca9767c73d99ce26891d83440c1 tmpbci 11:08@rebolek thks dander 18:21@greggirwin thanks for the explanation on types. We are all hungry for knowledge here :smile: Wednesday 5th December, 2018 laturk 06:10Has pgsql-protocol.r been ported to red? endo64 06:43@laturk Nope, IO and ports are the next big steps for Red, will be available on v0.7.0, before that we'll stick with simple-io (basic file operations and limited HTTP/S support and no protocols) laturk 06:52@endo64 So pgsql-protocol.red cannot be done until IO and ports is done? IO and ports are not done yet? endo64 07:07@laturk Correct, currently we have simple-io which covers only basic file & http operations via read. But we don't have open, tcp & udp ports yet. It is the next step. Check Milestones on Trello: https://trello.com/b/FlQ6pzdB/red-tasks-overview rebolek 07:31http and https to be precise. laturk 07:55@endo64 and @rebolek Thanks. It seems that rebol 2 does not support https. Am I correct? rebolek 07:56@laturk Right. Rebol 3 does however. laturk 08:00@rebolek Thanks! rebol 3 may solve my problem. I'm looking forward to using red though. rebolek 08:00@laturk Be warned that Rebol3 was abandoned in alpha stage, so it may not be the best tool, if you're not ready to deal with random bugs. laturk 08:02@rebolek Can it run pgsql-protocol.r? rebolek 08:02@laturk I don't know pgsql-protocol.r, do you have some link? laturk 08:06https://www.softinnov.org/rebol/pgsql-usage.html 08:09Does rebol/core support https? rebolek 08:13@laturk port model changed between R2 and R3 so I don't expect it to work. laturk 08:15@rebolek Well, I'll try rebol3, and if it doesn't work, I'll just have to wait for red.

Thanks! dsunanda 17:29It's not just with web resources - Red cannot read this file (written with R2) write %test.txt to-string to-char 163 ;; valid "£" character 9214 17:30 text >> write %test.txt to string! to char! 163 >> read %test.txt == "£" Oldes 17:31@laturk you should also know, that Rebol2 has serious issues in the call implementation and it may fail. dsunanda 17:31Did you write it from an R2 session? This is what I see: read %test.txt *** Access Error: invalid UTF-8 encoding: #{A3000000} *** Where: read laturk 17:33@Oldes Noted. Thanks. 9214 17:35@dsunanda well, maybe it's R2 to blame? R3 works fine. Oldes 17:35@dsunanda Rebol2 does not save it in UTF-8! >> to-binary to-string to-char 163 == #{A3} In Red or Rebol3: >> to-binary to-string to-char 163 == #{C2A3} dsunanda 17:38It's more that Red cannot read many plain ASCII files - ie those containing characters with the high bit set. Not sure blaming that on R2 is helpful :) It's an interoperability issue between Red and systems that write plain ASCII files. Oldes 17:39I agree, that it is Red's limitation. Rebol3 can load such an ascii text: >> to-string #{A3} == "£" >> to-string #{C2A3} == "£" greggirwin 18:04Some Latin1 support was being worked on in Red, and read has an /as refinement for future extensions in this area. 18:04On system words, there is also the what command. 18:05I've never liked that name. It was carried over from R2. Oldes 18:09@greggirwin do you have better name? greggirwin 18:10Not yet. giesse 19:06@dsunanda To be pedantic, that's Latin1 not ASCII. Red can do ASCII. :) But, in general, there's not much Red can do magically, you need to tell it how the text is encoded. You could port my R2 code to Red if this is an issue for you. :P https://giesse.github.io/rebol-power-mezz/#section-5.21 dsunanda 19:54Thanks Gabriele - it's good to be precise. The Red documentation on the [differences between READ in Rebol and Red](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BDOC%5D-Differences-between-Red-and-Rebol#read) does not highlight the limitations in reading Latin1 - so the issue may be a bug. Though it does note that the current "simple" functionality may change - so this may be addressed in later iterations. rebolek 20:02@9214 it happens not only with Google, but for example with one message in Gitter too and of course with lot of Czech pages, which are using CP-1250 for ages and don't bother to update. 20:04I have a simple function to auto-convert such pages, when using send-request https://github.com/rebolek/red-tools/blob/master/http-tools.red#L378 giesse 20:56@dsunanda R2 doesn't really care about the text encoding, aside from CR and LF when not using /binary (so, it could mess up text encoded in something not ASCII-compatible). Red and R3 will try to decode the text, so if it's not UTF-8 you get problems. It might make sense to relax the decoding and just replace anything invalid with a ? or something like that, instead of throwing an error... perhaps with a /strict refinement to enforce the current behavior... but in general if you don't know the encoding of some text then it would be best to treat it as binary instead. GiuseppeChillemi 21:43I Need to create and app that takes a geotagged picture and send It to a server together with email and phone id. 21:44Could I make It in Red and publish on the play store ? Do we have everything ? greggirwin 22:05@GiuseppeChillemi, the Android branch is experimental, and we're still Alpha. I'll say Red isn't ready for that, but the camera interface works, there is no email support, but maybe an HTTP service could be used. We haven't looked at Play Store publishing at all yet, so that's something to be researched. GiuseppeChillemi 22:11Ok, I Need to find and alternate multiplatform language (ios android ) which Is Quick to learn Thursday 6th December, 2018 endo64 06:19@GiuseppeChillemi or use a hybrid solution like ionic rebolek 07:21Is it somehow possible for a function to access its context, something like self in object!? 08:27context? , of course. 08:28thanks @rebolek GiuseppeChillemi 08:37@rebolek You are thanking yourself, I am concerned about you, how many hours your are in front of your PC without taking a pause ? rebolek 08:37:smile: BeardPower 11:01It's all just in his head ;-) GiuseppeChillemi 16:15@BeardPower he referenced his inner self object Friday 7th December, 2018 BeardPower 00:57@GiuseppeChillemi :-) greggirwin 06:04:^) planetsizecpu 08:29@rebolek @BeardPower @GiuseppeChillemi and we must not forget that everything is data, we included, we are only a block like [GTACATCG ...] ;-) GiuseppeChillemi 10:19At the end, all of us will be bound to the global context. BeardPower 11:46@planetsizecpu Or is data everything? ;-) planetsizecpu 12:11@BeardPower :-) I'm not sure, but think about this: when our REPL loop finishes evaluating us, there will be an actor from the local environment that will move us to the GC of the global context hahaha (I think it's time to move to the chit-chat room or someone will throw us) rebolek 12:14It's fine. Red is leaking memory like there's no tomorrow, so there's a good chance GC will never catch you. moliad 14:44> It's fine. Red is leaking memory like there's no tomorrow Yeah, we noticed that too. After christmas we'll have to work on the block lexer cause it seems like its using 100x the memory it should (As per my quick mental calculations) rebolek 16:09The good thing is that this kind of bugs is very simple to fix. greggirwin 18:250.6.4 Announcement: https://www.red-lang.org/2018/12/064-simple-gc-and-pure-red-gui-console.html toomasv 18:25:clap: :clap: :exclamation: dander 18:41:clap: Great job team, and keep up the good work! I totally missed the console highlighting. Any reason that's not on by default? I'm so excited for IO/async :smile: 9214 18:47> Any reason that's not on by default? I think because it's static and can be extremely confusing. And also limited only to a handful of datatypes. greggirwin 19:24@dander, what @9214 said, and it's also more experimental than a polished feature. We can enhance the settings dialog to allow customization, and are happy to have people play with theme ideas. The current color choices have not been run by Ethan Schoonover. dander 19:34@greggirwin @9214 , thanks for the explanations. Looks like a good start 👍 GiuseppeChillemi 21:22> 0.6.4 Announcement: https://www.red-lang.org/2018/12/064-simple-gc-and-pure-red-gui-console.html Congratulation for you great work 21:22But I have a But ! shagrouni_twitter 21:30Great work. Thank you. GiuseppeChillemi 21:38@dockimbel During the years from 2004 to 2012 a lot of Windows XP rugged tabletpcs have been shipped. They have been used in the salels force automation field and they come equipped with full 1D/2D barcode readers. They are the perfect cheap solution and I have already tested RED GUI on them. VID is the perfect companion to those products.I am not talking about salse force automation alone but inventory keeping and data entry. If you drop this support an entire market made of cheap but powerfull solutions will be wiped. I have replaced 800/1500 USD products with 60USD one. Please, keep this OS supported ! ne1uno 21:41@GiuseppeChillemi have you tried compiling for Xp or building/running old-gui? 9214 21:41If you can find a maintaner for XP builds, or if you want to do it yourself, then yeah, we can support it. Otherwise you just give us an anecdotal evidence and ask to spread already scattered resources even thinner. 21:41> Providing the maximum number of features across platforms **is not easy**, and we will need to freeze support for older OSs, like Windows XP, **so we can focus efforts on the systems used by more people today**. GiuseppeChillemi 21:45@9214 Having it supported could be a great plus as many industrial PC are very slow being replaced and GUI could run on them. And no, I have not the skill to maintain RED on those machines but I am currently building solutions for them. 21:46Those are the products I am talking about (https://www.ebay.it/itm/Motion-Computing-MC-C5-Tablet-PC-10-4-Zoll-Core-2-Duo-2GB-64GB-SSD/142772143127?hash=item213de20417:g:fP8AAOSwm3pZ5d-j:rk:4:pf:0) 21:47And yes, there could be GREAT develpment on it thanks to RED lightsize nature. 21:48My future plans are all table based and currently there is no better way to have BARCODES readed other than those machines. 21:49Interactive data entry based barcode reading could only be done in RED using those machines. 9214 21:50Before breeding the polemics, have you actually tried to use Red on XP? Old GUI console is still pretty functional, and View might work just fine to fit your needs. GiuseppeChillemi 21:57Vladimir, I don't want to be polemic, I am politely requesting to avoid dropping this OS. And no, I have just purchased some test tablets as I am developing on Windows 10 being sure it would work on WindowsXP. Some bugs regarding the GUI have been solved moving away from the last 6.3 stable release adopting night builds so I am 100% sure I will have problems with old GUI. 21:58Thanks to RED running on those machines, a 15.000 USD solution could be adopted spending 700USD. ne1uno 22:01old gui will fail if nobody uses it 9214 22:02> I am politely requesting to avoid dropping this OS. And the team politely decided to drop its support, to concentrate on more widely supported platofrm instead. But you don't seem to listen. > And no, I have just purchased some test tablets Well, maybe you should base your requests on the facts. Because, as of now, you haven't checked if Red works on XP, but you already ask us to do something about it. GiuseppeChillemi 22:09> > I am politely requesting to avoid dropping this OS. > > And the team politely decided to drop its support, to concentrate on more widely supported platofrm instead. But you don't seem to listen. Vladimir I am writing this becaues I have listened. > > And no, I have just purchased some test tablets > > Well, maybe you should base your requests on the facts. Because, as of now, you haven't checked if Red works on XP, but you already ask us to do something about it. The test application is ready and next week, upon tablets arrival, I will test RED and GUI on 10" screen. I have developed and planned based on XP support from RED and actually there is no other solution in this price range. Moving to Windows 8 will at least triple the cost and the number of tablets available is very low as they are currently being used on field. 22:11RED has a great advantage on old machines and not supporting them makes it loose this advantage. BeardPower 22:11@GiuseppeChillemi WinXP was even dropped by it's inventor. It needs a lot of resources to support ancient technology which the team does not have so it needs to concentrate on what matters for most people. I'm sure that some people are also asking about 16-bit support but look at how Apple deals with that. 22:13You can still use the old versions of Red but don't expect that WinXP is dragged along. It would poison the road to success. dander 22:14It kind of sounds to me like businesses in the position of having a lot invested in old devices might be willing to pay for that maintenance, but I don't see why they should get that for free GiuseppeChillemi 22:15@BeardPower If it really so time consuming that main development could suffer I won't ask it anymore, but if it will take 0,9% of resources having such large base which suits perfectly on RED I would keep it. BeardPower 22:16@GiuseppeChillemi WinXP is officially EOL so any issues that would arise from it would be left for the team to solve, not it's vendor. 9214 22:16@dander if we're talking about industrial PCs, they almost never get upgrated. There's simply no time to do an upgrade, because to do so you need to stop manufacturing, and that means material losses. GiuseppeChillemi 22:16@dander Dave, because not all business have such big pockets and cheap 2nd hand machinery is a big market. BeardPower 22:17@GiuseppeChillemi Which machinery? I don't run my CNC with WinXP ;-) GiuseppeChillemi 22:18@BeardPower LOL. I have included PCs in "machinery" terminology. 9214 22:19Perhaps this is the time when you all move to [chit-chat](https://gitter.im/red/chit-chat). BeardPower 22:19@GiuseppeChillemi I see. I can't recall anyone I know running WinXP these days. 22:20WinXP is also limited in RAM and API support. Features would not be implemented because the OS does not support them. GiuseppeChillemi 22:24@BeardPower GUI/FILE and NETWORKING is enough. 22:24@9214 ok, lets move ! greggirwin 22:59XP support comes down to a business decision, based on what people are willing to pay for it, and whether it's enough to justify dedicating resources to it. It's also possible, because Red is open source, that people who need XP support could maintain it themselves, using what they can from the mainline to stay in sync. Saturday 8th December, 2018 gltewalt 00:08Every time someone types X P, it comes through as a yuck face 00:09Or dead face, or whatever it’s supposed to be 9214 00:09Chit. Chat. gltewalt 00:10No, I don’t think it’s supposed to represent Chit Chat 9214 00:12Okay, but I really think that you should talk about it in [chit-chat](https://gitter.im/red/chit-chat) instead. pekr 05:58In the past, Bobik did some R2 app for one international company production line. Guys bought some devices on eBay, those having just 12MB of RAM and the storage being a network drive. Those devices were not able to run web browser, so R2 was a good fit. The app worked for them for several years, but later on, those devices were replace anyway. While I like the ability to show the strength of the Redbol languages in such constraint environments, I also like living a bit more on the edge. So yes - I wish smooths animations, I wish backend being Direct2D based, etc. Wait, it means dropping XP and maybe even Win7? Its good with me. And as 9214 suggests, maybe it even works - there might as well be some fallback solutions, meaning that XP will still work, just not using the newest stuff, hence being limited, who know ... My brother runs a PC shop for 15 years. Along with the local competition, they no more support maintaining XP machines. If you as a customer want to reinstall one, you will pay fortune for it, so it might be cheaper to buy some older PC with newer OS. So, for me - planning any project around XP nowaday is very bad planning, especially security wise. I think that Red team has thought out eventual consequences, but I welcome dropp of the XP for a good, as it will allow to keep View being based upon newer technologies .... rcqls 10:17After reading the blog post about the Red 0.6.4 annoucement and particularly the comment "Apple's talk of eliminating all 32-bit support could impact us ». Could it be possible as an intermediate solution before (the potentially costly) introduction of red in 64bits to prioritize the development of red linux GTK useable in any docker (red/GTK inside a container) + X server (native) ? It could be useable in any OS since docker and Xserver are provided in any OS (even though docker is natively available for linux 64bits distrib). Installation of red/GTK container could be easily installed. Just a thought even though I would prefer the 64bits version directly…. Thank you, Red Team, for this new release! planetsizecpu 10:42@TheRedTeam Congratulations! great news, console upgrades help so much, push hard. Now that we have 0.6.4 go for I/O and x64. rcqls 11:06I’ll try to follow this [guide](http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials/GUI) if it is possible do launch red/GTK inside a docker container running on my macOS... GiuseppeChillemi 14:43I confirm RED 0.6.4 compiling and being able to run an APP with GUI on Windows XP dockimbel 14:52@rebolek > It's fine. Red is leaking memory like there's no tomorrow, so there's a good chance GC will never catch you. I am not aware of any leak expect for the image buffers not freed when image! values are collected. Do you have any info about what is leaking and how to reproduce it? rebolek 14:53@dockimbel I will try to document it and write some detailed info about it and let you know. 14:54It's not some exotic case, so it should be easy to do. dockimbel 14:54@moliad > Yeah, we noticed that too. After christmas we'll have to work on the block lexer cause it seems like its using 100x the memory it should (As per my quick mental calculations) Please write us a report in a ticket, so we can investigate eventual leaks. rebolek 15:13@dockimbel I found it by trying Red with Valgrind. dockimbel 16:48@rebolek So it's not related to Red's memory manager and GC, as Valgrind can't see Red series allocations (at best, it can just see that Red allocates big virtual memory chunks). Other than that, the Red runtime does allocate some persistent internal data structures using malloc() that are kept until the process quits. So, I guess you misinterpreted the Valgrind report. If you have solid evidence of memory leaks, please open a ticket with all the logs and code to reproduce them. rebolek 16:52@dockimbel Yes, I wasn't talking about GC, sorry for misunderstanding. What I was talking about is that there's still allocated memory *after* Red quits. Anyway, I will take a deeper look at and do a report. dockimbel 16:52@rebolek I don't see how there can be any allocated memory after the Red process terminates... The only known leak is the bitmaps object allocated from the OS by image! values. rebolek 16:53"not properly released" is better term, I guess? dockimbel 17:04@rebolek As I said above, we never free the internal data structures in the runtime because they are meant to be persistent. When a process terminates, all the related memory maps are released by the OS, so there is no possible leak there. The only possible detectable leaks could be in some parts of the code where malloc() is used for internal temporary buffers (mostly in crypto, simple-io and GUI backend code), but such leaks can't be properly detected by Valgrind for now, until we add a "free all" step on process exit, to remove all the false positives. Anyway, some of those temporary buffers will be gone soon (simple-io) or will be replaced by Red's own allocator. Once all that is done, then you can run Valgrind and have a usable result. 17:07For the record, Red's memory allocator does not rely on malloc(), so Valgrind will not help you there. rebolek 17:18@dockimbel the GC work very well, BTW. Gitter stats were using around 2GB of memory and with GC, it's down to just 200 MB. dockimbel 17:21@rebolek Any noticeable slow-down? rebolek 17:43@dockimbel not at all, it spends so much time downloading data from net, so any effect GC has is not noticeable. hiiamboris 20:08@dockimbel I just found a weird crash on Linux with recycle/on 9214 20:12@hiiamboris it's probably GC-related. You should try to reproduce it and post in /bugs room. hiiamboris 20:12@9214 exactly my thoughts! 21:39https://github.com/red/red/issues/3640 Sunday 9th December, 2018 tmpbci 02:08about simple io, I guess http get xould be "read https://github.com/red/red", but how to build a post ? 9214 02:11@tmpbci https://github.com/red/red/wiki/[DOC]-Guru-Meditations#how-to-make-http-requests tmpbci 02:17thanks @9214, the 0.6.3 pointed to make url! 02:17doc.red-lang.or laturk 18:49@dockimbel I owe you a big thank you for helping me through a rebol2 problem over a year ago. I don't remember what the problem was, but I remember that you even provided the code I needed. Also, thanks for pgsql-protocol.r which I have just used in a program, and is a tremendous help. Monday 10th December, 2018 dockimbel 06:50@laturk You're welcome! Glad you like the PostgreSQL driver. Full I/O support is coming in Red soon (work on 0.7.0 has already began), so we'll make sure that the database drivers I wrote for Rebol will be ported to Red. pekr 07:09@dockimbel I expect Red IO being async in nature. Will it be similar to R3 model, or you have a different idea, as far as implementation goes? The second question I can't even envision - could reactivity model reach IO? Could it be any useful? Thanks .... dockimbel 08:28@pekr We keep most of the port concept and datatype, and improve it by adding some missing features (like streaming support) and provide a better interface for async behavior programming. Our reactive model is based on reactive objects, and ports will inherits those features, so yes, it will be possible to have reactions operating from/to IO events. pekr 08:44Thanks, good times ahead then! rebolek 08:47:+1: BuilderGuy1 16:00 So if I'm hearing this right, if I learn the R3 port model now, I would be well prepared for RED 0.7.0 ? dockimbel 16:09@BuilderGuy1 I am not sure yet if we keep the callback model of R3 as a low-level layer or not. Anyway, there will be differences. BuilderGuy1 16:19ok thanks ! TheHowdy_gitlab 16:26Congratulation for the new release Team Red :thumbsup: Was waiting for the official announcement since the download button became labelled 0.6.4 16:29Kinda an off-topic question: ; This works collect [parse "aaa" [some ["a" (keep "b")]]] ; But why this doesn't? blk: [some ["a" (keep "b")]] collect [parse "aaa" blk] Please note that I know that parse itself has collect/keep integrated, but I need to access it from within ( ) 16:35Some binding and context speciffic stuff I guess, but is it possible somehow? gltewalt 16:50That information is merely data inside blk toomasv 16:59@TheHowdy_gitlab blk: bind [some ["a" (keep "b")]] :collect As keep is defined inside function, it needs to be bound to the function context. @gltewalt By binding you can change "merely data" into bound data :smile: TheHowdy_gitlab 17:12@toomasv Thank you! But why does it get bound automaticly in the first case, but needs manual binding in the second one? As far as I can tell, collect walks the code recursively and binds every single occurency of keep to the function.. hiiamboris 17:15@TheHowdy_gitlab it walks recursively into blocks [...], not into blocks referred by words (blk) TheHowdy_gitlab 17:19@hiiamboris Thanks, I see. That's why collect compose [parse "aaa" (blk)] gives me a parserelatted error, not a collect related one. hiiamboris 17:24@TheHowdy_gitlab compose/only is the way to do that. And please peruse the dedicated /help room. TheHowdy_gitlab 17:24@hiiamboris Alright. I'll do it the next time. Tuesday 11st December, 2018 quipa 12:23@ne1uno thanks for pointing me to the gitter :), way more people then in the freenode channel hehe... 9214 12:34@quipa welcome! quipa 12:35thank you Vladimir @9214 :) 12:36Red seems to be the language I have been looking for a while now hehe 9214 12:36Do you need any resources to get you started? quipa 12:36I first learned "serious" programming with Python, and after finding out it's limitations I have been exploring lots of different languages 12:37Sure! I am just getting acquainted to the concept of Red for now through the Recode 2013 talk 12:37had a quick look at the syntax in Wikipedia and Learn X in Y minutes 12:37felt a lot like scheme, lisp, logo 12:39any resources that would be appropriate for someone that feels more at ease with scripting / dynamic languages like Python, Ruby, Scheme? 9214 12:39We have a list of learning resources compiled [here](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/[LINKS]-Learning-resources). The best way to start is by reading [Rebol/Core](http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore.html) and sticking around in [/help](https://gitter.im/red/help) and [/welcome](https://gitter.im/red/red/welcome) rooms. quipa 12:39ah nice! 12:40ok will do thanks :) Vladimir @9214 9214 12:40Our official documentation is in a perpetual TBD state, so I'd suggest to pick some more-or-less trivial scripting task and ask questions as you go. quipa 12:40ok ok will do ;) 9214 12:41While reading /Core guide, you'll stumble on Rebol2 and Red incompatibilities, they are covered [here](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BDOC%5D-REBOL-Core-Users-Guide-__-A-walkthrough-with-Red). quipa 12:41you read my mind hehe 12:42cool thanks, this will get me going well I think :) 9214 12:43Cool then. Have fun. :wink: quipa 12:43any resources you recommend for gui / reactive programming? 12:43in Red 12:43Hope to do that very soon after getting started on the language 9214 12:44You'll find trivial examples here and there in learning resources. [Official documentation](https://doc.red-lang.org/en/) should cover the details. quipa 12:44ok! I had a quick look before seemed approachable 12:45@9214 thanks for the warm welcome :) 9214 12:46Enjoy the ride. quipa 12:47Think one thing I can contribute soon enough is a Portuguese translation of any docs 13:18In the Recode 2013 talk Nenad mentions a Meta-DSL tool, has that been developed since then? 9214 13:18@quipa can you elaborate? quipa 13:19https://youtu.be/-KqNO_sDqm4?t=1470 13:20basically I am interested in using Red probably to do a DSL 13:20so any tool that might would be great! 13:21he says you could think of it as a higher-level parse 9214 13:21You don't need a meta-DSL to write a DSL. There were some talks in the past about more high-level tools like Rascal, Spoofax and ANTLR, but they require serious design efforts and time to implement. 13:22And Red 2.0 will tackle this question more thoroughly, when the time comes. quipa 13:23hum ok! BeardPower 15:23@quipa @9214 Do I smell a compiler compiler? ;-) 9214 15:23You don't even have a nose, Purple face. quipa 15:23hehe BeardPower 15:24> You don't even have a nose, Purple face. I'm like a bird, where you cannot see the ears ;-) RedJosh 16:25Please tell me if there is an editor like SCITE which will run my red program from file and point me to the line number where error is. 16:28I have a working program written in Rebol. It reads text files from stock exchange, parses and writes it in desired format to disk. The program has stopped working for certain URLs which have shifted from http to https. I am having a hard time to convert the program in Red. 9214 16:30There's no such editor. dockimbel 17:25@hiiamboris Seems like your [PR](https://github.com/red/red/commit/168c3ee296c500847af2c2864ee0741922299b09) [broke the tests](https://travis-ci.org/red/red/builds) on non-Windows platforms. You cannot put View tests in the main tests suite, as View engine is not available on all platforms, and a GUI environment is not guaranteed to exists on the test servers. 17:32I see you've put some checking for View at the beginning of the tests, but those checks will not work for compiled code, as the compiler will process the whole script anyway, and erroring out on unknown features. You should rather use a macro and generate the tests only if the checks are passed. hiiamboris 17:35@dockimbel Yeah I know. Sorry. I asked Gregg not to merge it just yet, but he forgot. Here's a partial fix for it https://github.com/red/red/pull/3648. On the bright side, I have found another bug https://github.com/red/red/issues/3649. Should I comment out the tests so they are skipped until we resolve the macOS bug or let it fail? dockimbel 17:35@hiiamboris Yep, you can disable the tests until a proper fix is found. 17:40The tests suite is used for regression checking, not for TDD, so it's important that the tests are always passing, in order to track potential regression on new commits, and keep the codebase as stable as possible. hiiamboris 17:41:+1: 17:41Also. How do you usually test the Mac stuff locally? Any advice? I took back my granny's Mac for now. Not that she's using it often, but it's a super annoying device. I remember I installed a hackintosh VM once, but it was so slow that it was almost useless. dockimbel 17:58We use both hackintosh VMs and real Mac hardware (we bought a second-hand Mac mini just for testing purpose at the office). rebolek 18:01@RedJosh given Rebol and Red nature, it's very hard to convert running code to line numbers in source. 18:03That doesn't mean there couldn't be IDE that points you in the right direction, but such IDE takes time to do it correctly. 18:03I guess. hiiamboris 18:13@dockimbel So, how those hackintoshes perform? If good enough, what VM software and OS version should I try to setup my own? dockimbel 18:26@hiiamboris On our 4Ghz i7, it is often faster than the Mac mini. Though, I remember that 10.11 was quite slow. Other versions are performing fast enough. hiiamboris 18:30On VMware, VBox, or Qemu or..? dockimbel 18:32VMware. hiiamboris 18:32Ok. Thank you. Wednesday 12nd December, 2018 endo64 08:10@RedJosh You can use VS Code, Notepad++ (see https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BNOTES%5D-Editor-Integrations) or http://helpin.red/Rededitor.html to execute your Red scripts and see the output, but not line number of an error as there is no such information.

RedJosh 17:15Extremely sorry. Going there. meijeru 21:30Looks like the github feed in the right column on this page is stalled. 21:30Latest item 18:10 (my time, it's now 22:30 here). greggirwin 21:38Sorry on the test merge issue. I thought that was resolved with the checks @hiiamboris had in there, and the note about not being able to macro it for testing. 21:38I'm just so excited to see tickets getting closed! ;^) Thursday 13th December, 2018 Dobeash 07:07DECOMPRESS has me a bit baffled.

Any insight appreciated. dockimbel 07:28@qtxie ^--- qtxie 08:34@Dobeash Thanks. I can reproduce the error. Open an issue #3660 for it. meijeru 20:02I would like to comment on one line in a source file. I can't find how to do that on Github. Also, to draw attention to that comment, I would like to "advertise" it in one of these rooms. What's the best way? greggirwin 20:15@meijeru, you can comment on PRs, but not plain repo files. What you can do is click on the line number next to the line you want, which will give you a direct link to that line. e.g. https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/runtime/datatypes/char.reds#L35 Oldes 20:18@greggirwin @meijeru better to click on "three dots" next to line number and use permalink, because above link can become out of sync with future file updates. 20:18[![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/red/red/V7VT/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/red/red/V7VT/image.png) 20:18Permalink: https://github.com/red/red/blob/5ffef49367450a8edac1651ce0b4aee7bbad9819/runtime/datatypes/char.reds#L35 meijeru 20:25OK here it comes: in %environment/routines.red, there is two occasions where, instead of using the formal argument name, the code refers to stack/arguments . That seems to defeat the purpose of routine argument passing. See [set-quiet](https://github.com/red/red/blob/5ffef49367450a8edac1651ce0b4aee7bbad9819/environment/routines.red#L20) and [set-current-dir](https://github.com/red/red/blob/5ffef49367450a8edac1651ce0b4aee7bbad9819/environment/routines.red#L52) greggirwin 20:29Thanks @oldes, good point. Friday 14th December, 2018 ocket8888 03:00hello everyone, long time no see 03:01I was thinking of writing a Ren parsing engine, but the website link to "Test Files" that I was counting on is broken. Anoyone know where I could get my hands on some of those? 03:02I guess technically any Red/REBOL3 program is valid Ren (except that the header name needs to change)... but I was hoping for something more Ren-specific 03:06(I'm looking at you, @greggirwin ) 9214 03:25@ocket8888 what stops you from studying Red's lexer? ocket8888 03:26well, nothing stops me. I'm just not terribly familiar with Red, and the last time I looked at the lexer I'm pretty sure I noticed it was self-hosted. 9214 03:27The first step, then, is to get more faimiliar with Red. ocket8888 03:28that'd be the first step to understand the Red lexer, but I think it's heavy-handed for a Ren parser. That's not a typo, I'm talking about the Ren data serialization format, not Red the programming language 03:29Edit: direct link https://pointillistic.com/ren/ 9214 03:30I know what Ren is, and I also know that it was inspired by Rebol. And that Red is lexically compatible with Rebol. ocket8888 03:32alright just checking. Red expresses concepts that are outside the bounds of Ren - I don't need to distinguish between refinements or know whether a block is part of a set of function arguments 03:34and besides all that, I still want test files, no matter how I build the thing. 03:35I could write my own, but the provided files were probably more thorough than I could think to be, at least initially. 9214 03:38> I don't need to distinguish between refinements or know whether a block is part of a set of function arguments No idea what that means. Here's [Rebol syntax project](https://github.com/rebolsource/rebol-syntax/blob/master/syntax.r). @rgchris has [railroad diagrams](http://reb4.me/r/rebol.html). Start from that. greggirwin 03:39@ocket8888 I'd love to revive the Ren project at some point. Just no time. ocket8888 03:41@9214 You can find 'refinement' under AnyWord in those railroad diagrams. Didn't look for function blocks. @greggirwin That's what you said in January! You must be a busy guy. greggirwin 04:41It's been a busy year. 9214 05:44We also have a formal specification effort leaded by @meijeru. It's choke full of EBNF grammars for everything you need. greggirwin 17:55"chock" full, though there are enough specs to keep you chewing for a while. ;^) Saturday 15th December, 2018 Oldes 14:129 14:120 meijeru 14:24:question: Oldes 14:28Sorry.. mobile in a pocket. meijeru 14:30I have just had to close an issue after 2 minutes, because it was pointed out to me (thankfully) that it was a duplicate. The vast backlog of issues, coupled with the enthousiastic trying out of all Red's wonderful facilities, leads to issues being found many times over. If there are too many, it will be hard to avoid duplicates, and equally hard to trap them. The team is obviously short of experienced hands to get rid of those issues. How is the hiring of staff progressing? 9214 17:20Instead of making public inquires in affairs that team is not obliged to disclose, I'd tackle this problem from a different point of view - establishing guidelines and requirements for issue titles. Plain-English, easily searchable words, with datatypes, functions and values written in CAPS, perhaps ad-hoc tags and keywords. On that note, @hiiamboris recently got a go-ahead on fixing bugs and tracking issues, and does an extremely good job at it. Everyone with enough skills, free time and a will to help can apply too. GiuseppeChillemi 19:02@meijeru > I have just had to close an issue after 2 minutes, because it was pointed out to me (thankfully) that it was a duplicate.

How is the hiring of staff progressing? Which is your proposal ? What should "experienced hands do ?". I see a lot of work behind the scene and their are also helping us a lot, so if your proposal could free some of their time and be more efficient I suppose they could consider adopting it. 19:05@Oldes > 9 > 0 0 9 19:05(You will understand ;-) ) greggirwin 21:38> The vast backlog of issues, coupled with the enthousiastic trying out of all Red's wonderful facilities, leads to issues being found many times over. @meijeru, there is no good answer to this, as we are limited by github and human search capabilities. It's not just open issues, but closed issues as well, which were false alarms, bad ideas, etc. As to the rest, it's all a balancing act. For those interested in fixing bugs, we can offer some support for their time, and are grateful for contributions in all areas. meijeru 23:19@9214 Your idea to have guidelines for issue titles sounds good! I am looking forward to a concrete proposal. Sunday 16th December, 2018 metaperl 23:32Red seems very interesting because it has "objects" but there is not a lot of code involving constructors... Is it easy to create derivations of objects? And how would you write a web app in Red? Perhaps some sort of virtual remote desktop executing a GI app? 23:38it's very interesting how it is procedural and focused on doing things, but in the process objects with attributes are created. Monday 17th December, 2018 greggirwin 02:10Welcome @metaperl. Red's object system is prototype based, like Self, which also influenced JS's design in that regard. There is no constructor method, as with some class-based systems. When you make an object, the spec is evaluated, which may include code outside functions in the object (we don't call them methods in Red). You can then make objects from other objects. You can play around in the REPL, add probe calls, and see how things work pretty easily. There is no web target for Red right now, though a WASM back end is a possibility. Red is quite different, though it can look familiar. The best way to learn it is to try and let go of what you know (hard to do), then start tinkering and asking questions. Happy Reducing! JacobGood1 02:41you could create a "web app" by hosting a red program on something like amazon app streaming service Oldes 16:04I just noticed, that Red is able to load ISO8601 dates: >> 2013-11-08T17:01 == 8-Nov-2013/17:01:00 >> 2013-11-08T17:01+01 == 8-Nov-2013/17:01:00+01:00 >> 2013-11-08T17:01Z == 8-Nov-2013/17:01:00 It is nice addition for cross-communication, but I wonder... cannot we have in-built way how to get these ISO dates without using custom made functions, which would most probably use replace function? 16:05@greggirwin Maybe it is time to release your format function? 16:29Red is even more complete than I thought.. interesting: >> 20181217T0000Z == 17-Dec-2018/0:00:00 >> 2018-W51 == 17-Dec-2018 >> 2018-351 == 17-Dec-2018 rebolek 18:32@Oldes reading release notes has its merits https://www.red-lang.org/2017/07/063-macos-gui-backend.html 18:33> The biggest addition to the core language in this release is the date! datatype, which supports all Rebol's date! datatype features and more. The additions include support for a large range of ISO 8601 date formats. About 350 unit tests have been written so far. The full documentation is available here. 18:34https://doc.red-lang.org/en/datatypes/date.html Tuesday 18th December, 2018 greggirwin 04:24It's hard to keep up with features, as there are a lot. @Oldes I'd *love* to get format dusted off. Just too many other things to do. Wednesday 19th December, 2018 Arie-vw 16:28In the first place: congrats Red Team for a new and important release. 16:33ANNOUNCEMENT: a while ago I took over maintenance of Red by Example from Gregg again, because my health had improved enough. At the moment I have bad health issues again. In order to make RBE more valuable. I am in the process of converting all contents to a Wiki. This will change RBE from a monolith, operated by one, or two people, to a community effort. That way my input will become less important and yet RBE will improve vastly, if the community will step in. When I am ready with the conversion I will send you the details. BeardPower 16:42@Arie-vw Sounds good and get well soon! greggirwin 17:48Thanks @Arie-vw. I think you mean you took it over from @mikeparr, not me. In any case, others may have input on a good platform or help with conversion scripts. It's a valuable resource, and we'll all do what we can do help, so you don't have to stress too much. Best of luck with your health issues. rebolek 18:04@Arie-vw Wiki approach is very good idea! Hope you get better soon! planetsizecpu 18:36@Arie-vw You did a great job, best wishes on your health. Arie-vw 19:15@gregg of coyrse 19:15of course i meant Mike!!!!! 19:15And thx! metaperl 20:10The programming-red wiki will be closed down in 15 days if it shows no activity - https://programming.red/wiki/Main_Page 20:11Is there an online interpreter for Red? I downloaded the win64 edition but it is blocked from usage. 20:18I think one of these online Unix interpreters should do the trick 20:25Uploading red-064 to https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_terminal_online.php and chmod 755 red-064 did not lead to it executing. rebolek 20:33@metaperl Red is 32bit only yet. metaperl 20:34@rebolek oh, I thought "064" meant 64-bit, but it actually is the release number :) rebolek 20:35@metaperl yeah, it's the newest version releaset just a week ago, once we move to 0.6.5 or 0.7.0, it would be clearer ;) 20:41@metaperl there was online interpreter, but it's not maintained anymore. I was thinking about doing one, had a test running, but unfortunately haven't got the time to prepare proper sandboxing. greggirwin 21:19@metaperl thanks for the alert on the programming.red wiki. While it doesn't apply to Red (as we have a lot of work to do and things to add there), what kind of policy *requires changes* in order to remain active? Should I delete all the books on my shelves? They do say you can contact a steward about it, but if you have a rule about activity, shouldn't it include all access, including reads? metaperl 21:31youre welcome @greggirwin . I really dont know... greggirwin 21:41I set up an account and made a few edits there. @GiuseppeChillemi seems to have done all the work there so far (Thanks!). @gltewalt, would you see if we have this linked from our main wiki, so we don't forget about it? endo64 21:52@greggirwin programming.red is on https://www.red-lang.org/p/documentation.html page. greggirwin 22:01Thanks. ne1uno 22:06@metaperl, did your av quarantine before you could run it or after compiling? 22:09is the 064 not upx'ed? there should be a note how to exclude directories near the download or getting started page? gltewalt 22:30@greggirwin Added a news item to the Red Wiki homepage about the Programming Red Wiki. Thursday 20th December, 2018 dander 01:48Is it really a bad thing if that wiki goes down? I don't think I've ever used it. It seems like it could be better to push toward more consolidated documentation than being everywhere. greggirwin 04:08@dander the hard thing is extrapolating based on our own use cases and experience. @GiuseppeChillemi clearly put some time into it, and it's another place people might discover Red. Without stats, we can't say if that's the case. Finding those stats would be great. dander 05:23@greggirwin one stat we have is the "no edits or logs for 45 days" message, which seems to imply that it hasn't gained much maintainer momentum, and this is another anecdotal comment, but I can't recall ever seeing people in Gitter referring to links there. I certainly don't want to disrespect the work put into it, but I think that having multiple wikis for the same purpose could also serve to dilute the resources put into either one. Or more likely, the weaker one will be mostly abandoned (and could also reflect poorly on the project if it became very out of date). The Github wiki has improved tremendously over the past few months. Perhaps the unique content from programming.red could be migrated? greggirwin 06:31There will always be community driven resources, and our goal is not to centralize all of those. People want to do their own thing, their own way, and that's fine. We could easily say that Team Red will not interfere with any of those, but that's tricky too. We want and need community resources. No easy answers. gltewalt 06:54If no one seems to have taken it up in a week, we could look at picking the best info from it and adding it elsewhere Arie-vw 12:41I intend to use Miraheze wiki https://miraheze.org/ for Red by Example, which is community funded. So it could be used for other Red stuff as well :) hiiamboris 12:50@Arie-vw what I love about RBE is that everything is on one (index) page. It makes it easy to search on. My only complaint is that category index is not at the top of the page but somewhere down below. Would be great if you could fix that :) Arie-vw 13:34@hiiamboris I see. But on the Wiki things will be a bit different! I intend to keep the indices on one page though, but the contents on different pages. That said, I can easily put the category index up front and also the individual doc pages can be accessed separately by theri name as well, which is nice I think! metaperl 21:31@ne1uno - I dont know what "av" refers to... I could not run the rebol-064 executable here at work. ne1uno 21:31anti virus. Friday 21st December, 2018 GiuseppeChillemi 08:26@greggirwin > I set up an account and made a few edits there. @GiuseppeChillemi seems to have done all the work there so far (Thanks!). @gltewalt, would you see if we have this linked from our main wiki, so we don't forget about it? You are welcome and thanks for the edits. I have not so much time as I am under heavy pressure caused from financial problems of my company because we have been victims of fraud, stolen checks and rackeeting. I'll try to find some milliseconds for this project to. rebolek 08:29@GiuseppeChillemi That's sad to hear. Hope you will get better soon! GiuseppeChillemi 08:43@rebolek we are fighting hard to get out of the situation. RED is a precious companion I am using to build the tools needed for next year battles and to avoid that those events will repeat again. rebolek 08:52@GiuseppeChillemi That's great. I hope that with coming IO support, Red could help you even more! mikeparr 09:10@Arie-vw Hi Arie - let me know if there are bitsIcan do re RBE/wiki Arie-vw 18:12@mikeparr Will do, thx! GiuseppeChillemi 18:21@rebolek text-table, android, Money datatype, cgi, Full I/O, camera support, audio i/o, video streaming, access to android libraries ( for barcode components), are ( from top priority to bottom) , the parts I Need to complete all the planned tools. Some parts are already here, greggirwin 18:38Best of luck @GiuseppeChillemi. GiuseppeChillemi 21:30@greggirwin , thanks. 21:56I start the red console and type "help join", It seems not defined. Where am I wrong ? >> help join rejoin function! Reduces and joins a block of values. >> join *** Script Error: join has no value *** Where: catch *** Stack: >> gltewalt 22:24You're not wrong. It is not predefined. GiuseppeChillemi 22:25But I have used it inside my code, so it seems it is there. Am I having an hallucination ? gltewalt 22:26Did you define it in your code? GiuseppeChillemi 22:27No ! gltewalt 22:28My build is from the 6th, but: >> about Red 0.6.4 for Windows built 6-Dec-2018/22:41:53-07:00 commit #1bdbdc2 >> help join rejoin function! Reduces and joins a block of values. GiuseppeChillemi 22:29@greggirwin This code works with JOIN but it doesn't without it: ... append munge-string join " " mold compose [(condition)] ... dsunanda 22:34 "Help Join" - shows you all the defined words that contain "join" - just as (say) "help rej" does. It does not mean that Join or Rej are currently defined as words. Join is not defined in new console session -- what do you see if you type "source join" ? gltewalt 22:35use repend if you are ok with reducing values first before stitching them together 22:36or rejoin Maybe something like: rejoin [munge-string space condition] 22:37Better moved to red/help channel, though GiuseppeChillemi 22:38moved Saturday 22nd December, 2018 endo64 23:42Two questions about unview 1) unview returns no value (unset!) if screen pane is empty, returns tail of system/view/screens/1/pane which is no use. Should it return no value (or the screen pane) in both cases for consistency? 2) unview/all uses this block: while [not tail? pane] [remove back tail pane] is there any reason to remove windows one by one, clear pane would work as well. Keeping the order of opening is important during closing? Sunday 23th December, 2018 GiuseppeChillemi 00:02@Arie-vw > I intend to use Miraheze wiki https://miraheze.org/ for Red by Example, which is community funded. So it could be used for other Red stuff as well :) 00:02Administrator s are gentle and reply/act quickly 00:30@dander @Arie-vw I have considered GIT hub wiki but I prefeer mediawiki engine as it easily allow you to have the same page in multiple languages. Also, the wiki will be partly maintained from a RED script which will automatically update/add links inside tables, as incresing the number of RED pages it could become unmaintainable one it will grow. GET Hub is still an option as many wiki pages created from RED Team are there and so I understand it their preferred engine so we could join forces on a common language. I will continue on miraheze but If I will feel the need to change it I will move to GitHUB wiki. 00:32Also, what about moving to the DOCS section ? 00:32I feel the topic interesting and we can continue just there toomasv 09:34@endo64 You can use the returned value from unview, e.g.: view [ button [ view/flags [ button [ win-tail: unview ] ][modal popup] probe select first back win-tail 'type ] ] About unview/all I'm not sure. If there is any chance to modify the state of other windows during removing (as it is with close event), then it should be bone in backward order, if not, I donno. hiiamboris 10:46Maybe that was simply done to *define* the order of closing, make it top-to-bottom, so that loop length? system/view/screens/1/pane [unview] will have exactly the same effect as unview/all. I see nothing wrong with that. dockimbel 12:40@endo64 1) As you said the return value does not matter, so I prefer not to add code in order to provide the same return value if that does not matter. 2) Order does matter, we want windows to be closed in reverse order of their opening, as that is required to [properly handle](https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/modules/view/view.red#L215) modal windows, with nested event loops. endo64 13:17Thanks @dockimbel @toomasv @hiiamboris . I was thinking adding return to the end of the function to not return a value. As I thouhgt that returning two different types of value is somehow confusing especially for the beginners, or saying "return value of unview depends if it closes a window or not". Anyways, it's not our biggest issue :) Monday 24th December, 2018 dockimbel 10:57@endo64 If you are worrying about output when used from console, then I agree that it's better to not return anything. Tuesday 25th December, 2018 xmonader 22:30what is the state of red/view? can it run rebol/view demos ? gltewalt 22:33Yes.

Thank you! dockimbel 05:53Useful [reading](https://github.com/red/red/issues/3340#issuecomment-449908908) for old rebolers about repend intended behavior in Red. xmonader 05:57@gltewalt still dns problems rebolek 06:21@dockimbel That's a nice behavior, I guess. endo64 07:28> Useful [reading](https://github.com/red/red/issues/3340#issuecomment-449908908) for old rebolers about repend intended behavior in Red. Noted on "Differences between Red and Rebol" wiki page: https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BDOC%5D-Differences-between-Red-and-Rebol#repend dockimbel 13:21@endo64 Thanks! ndrewxie 16:22Guys 16:22Could someone please clarify what precisely red is meant to do? 16:22Is it a higher - level language? 16:22Lower - level? 16:22VM? 16:23GUI based? xmonader 16:43@ndrewxie I'm trying to figure out too, I was exposed to rebol many years ago, but it was bit complex for me. It promises a lot indeed, scripting in a very highlevel language with metaprogramming capabilities so it can replace python maybe for my sys admin tasks, GUI based with native os widgets, means can be a really good choice instead of electron all that in 1mb binary with 0 toolchain lepinekong_twitter 16:43Red people profiles target should be like Ruby people target: people who hate coding (like me) and ruby-on-rails creator: people who just want to get cool things done ;) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fdQJ5ry_NI hiiamboris 17:20@ndrewxie have you tried the about page? https://www.red-lang.org/p/about.html endo64 21:06> people who hate coding @lepinekong_twitter not exactly, people who hate coding with complex bloated programming languages that requires hundred MBs tools, dependencies and IDEs. BeardPower 21:59@lepinekong_twitter If you hate coding, you should look for a job different to programming. 22:01It's not an issue of the language but obviously some personal hate against programming. No language will help you with that. Ruby on rails is just a framework using Ruby. You still need to program in Ruby. There are a lot of people who can get cool things done even in Assembler. The language is just a tool. No framework or language is a magic bullet getting cool things done by just clicking on a button. Neither RoR nor Red. Thursday 27th December, 2018 lepinekong_twitter 12:05@BeardPower programming is not reduced coding ;) BeardPower 12:05@lepinekong_twitter Actually it is. lepinekong_twitter 12:06@BeardPower no it isn't, programming is about modelling and coding is not the best way to model. BeardPower 12:06@lepinekong_twitter Who ever talked about mdelling? 12:07You talked about programming. You should look up it's definition. 12:08But I will do it for you: the act or process of planning or writing a program. 12:08Anyway. Please let's move this discussion to chit-chat. Thanks. lepinekong_twitter 12:10@BeardPower I'm not interested to chichat with an obtuse guy who if he were living at the time of Grace Hopper would have joined the whole community of guys who pretend her idea was ridiculous ;) BeardPower 12:11@lepinekong_twitter Than I ask you to stop posting about it in this room. Thanks. 12:14I also ask you to step away from unfounded insults. 9214 12:14I would appreciate if this chat remain on topic.

Friday 28th December, 2018 dockimbel 03:49@christopherbclark Work on Red/C3 is ongoing, along with all our other main development branches. 04:13@hiiamboris Thanks for your new REP on Parse. :+1: mikeparr 09:15I came across this 5 min video, about parsing in Perl 6. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxaB6m_sQKk I was thinking about creating a similar one about parse in Red. Has anyone already done this? hiiamboris 11:30@dockimbel don't mention it ☺`
