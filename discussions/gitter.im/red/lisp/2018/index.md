[06:03](#msg5a545b2db48e8c3566b956b9)@AmurLisp\_twitter hard to say,, you should probably start asking here and people will help you and point you to different materials. There's no "Red web apps for Lispers" doc, AFAIK.

greggirwin

[16:42](#msg5a7c7de04a6b0dd32ba705b3)I glanced at it some time back. I also saw Qi mentioned in something I read recently, which brought it back to my mind. I seem to recall that it had some cool type system features, but it wasn't enough to make me jump in and start using it.

9214

[16:43](#msg5a7c7e33ce68c3bc746065da)it seems to share a lot with Red and Rebol, like built-in parser for example, or general smallness and portability

[16:43](#msg5a7c7e3f6117191e610fc06c)worth to keep on radar I suppose

greggirwin

[16:44](#msg5a7c7e83ce68c3bc74606859)Do you know how performance is? I think that's the reason Red and Rebol are built the way they are. I've always thought it would be interesting to build Red in both Scheme and Forth style, in Red, as an educational tool.

9214

[16:46](#msg5a7c7eeab3c4a0d376fa55bb)No idea about performance, I marked idea to port Shen to Red in my life-long todo list though ;)

greggirwin

[16:46](#msg5a7c7effe217167e2c5c809d)We should compare lists. Probably a lot of overlap. :^)

dander

[18:09](#msg5a7c926c7dcd63481f357e93)@9214 , there was a lot of discussion about Shen in the lisp channel with @JacobGood1 IIRC... I think it was some of the inspiration for macros in Red (or at least that was my impression)

9214

[18:10](#msg5a7c928ff283b8e546388d34)@dander nice, too bad Gitter search is :shit:, need to dig up this discussion

dander

[18:16](#msg5a7c93f07084124a34524788)@rebolek did you make a command-line gritter search? It seems the Gritter gui is unusable because of that evil bug :(

rebolek

[18:17](#msg5a7c944ab3c4a0d376fae61c)@dander You can search in command-line, but I don't know if it isn't affected by MEBIR also, I use old build. :/

dander

[18:18](#msg5a7c94637084124a345249d3)@9214 I've had better luck (than the Gitter search) finding things by downloading all the channels with Gritter, then using the VSCode all-files-search, but it's a bit messy because raw data has ids instead of usernames

[18:21](#msg5a7c953fb3c4a0d376faec6a)@rebolek Ahh, I see. I should maybe just do that. I wonder if it could run on 0.6.3 as well... It would be really useful to add a powerful search to the Gritter UI. Need to find a good search algorithm though. It's something I would be interested in tackling, but I haven't had any time to hack on Red in the last two months ðŸ˜ž

rebolek

[18:27](#msg5a7c9684b3c4a0d376faf4b0)@dander what I've got is just simple `find` on text data and return all matches. So nothing fancy yet. But usually I can get more results than from Gitter. There are other problems though, loading times are terrible in Red (I have an idea how to make it better, but haven't implemented it yet).

JacobGood1

[19:25](#msg5a7ca432f283b8e5463900ab)@9214 Shen is really cool, the performance depends on what it is running on. Shen is meant to be a symbiotic lisp, it needs a host first and foremost.

[19:26](#msg5a7ca4796117191e6110b60c)One thing about Shen is its pattern matching macros, there is no real way to replicate this in red without adding parens everywhere.

[19:27](#msg5a7ca4bace68c3bc74615b5f)@greggirwin theoretically, the type system in Shen is more powerful than any previous language that is known to Dr. Tarver(Shen creator), as well as me... if that counts.

JacobGood1

[21:32](#msg5a7cc1d1b3c4a0d376fbf4b9)Well, now I think we need special syntax for macros

[21:32](#msg5a7cc2074a6b0dd32ba8b7b8)because we cannot control their expansion, either that or some special function that tells red not to expand in certain places

[21:33](#msg5a7cc2164a6b0dd32ba8b7da)no-expand \[]

[21:33](#msg5a7cc23cf283b8e54639b1d2)just ad-libbing here

[21:35](#msg5a7cc296b3c4a0d376fbf827)in shen, it knows exactly where to expand a macro, if a certain syntactic pattern is found at the front of a list

[21:35](#msg5a7cc2b87084124a34534cd2)in red, it will expand the pattern wherever it occurs in the code... that is the problem

BillDStrong

[21:35](#msg5a7cc2b86117191e61116385)Wouldn't it be more useful to control the expansion of each layer of nested functions? so expand/1 would only affect the outer set of \[] in \[\[]]

JacobGood1

[21:36](#msg5a7cc2ed7dcd63481f3690a0)sure, im just saying we need something like this if we are going to control the macros

[21:37](#msg5a7cc3186117191e611166ca)otherwise we are all going to have some horrendous bugs to bite us

[21:39](#msg5a7cc37ace68c3bc74620d21)the issue is we are now back to composing, this is a hard problem

[21:42](#msg5a7cc44586ef1bb14186f606)maybe we just need an ide telling us a pattern is being matched for expansion, we can then verify whether we desire that to occur or not. However, that would make reds macro system be dependent on ide, I have no problem with that, others might. Ok, done spit balling for now.

greggirwin

[23:28](#msg5a7cdd1a93be87284d939e40)I agree that there are lessons we can learn from Shen, just can't drop them in directly though. Sounds like @JacobGood1 is the leading mind on this.

JacobGood1

[19:25](#msg5a87302fcd1c600323360998)@greggirwin lorddimwit is talking about multiple dispatch... which is something I would like to see as well

greggirwin

[20:08](#msg5a873a3617b16a2377580348)OK, how do you see it working in Red, and what's the big win?

JacobGood1

greggirwin

[22:34](#msg5a875c910202dc012e43f4a3)But if we had those, what is the big win over, say, a general pattern-action dispatcher (where the patterns could match simple arg types, but could also do more)?

geekyi

[22:54](#msg5a876122888332ee3a911493)Short version is, multiple dispatch allows a simpler api

greggirwin

[22:54](#msg5a876134a2194eb80d71da4c)How so?

[22:55](#msg5a87617a8f1c77ef3a16809f)In looking at examples, I see \*how* it's done, I just don't see how it's better yet. Mind you, I'm coming from a Redbol mindset.

geekyi

[22:57](#msg5a8761c3e4ff28713a87bd8b)Take for example, `function/refinements` .. what if, you can ignore the refinement, and the implementation chooses the refinement based on the type?

greggirwin

[22:57](#msg5a8761f5e4ff28713a87be6d)Can you give me a concrete example?

geekyi

[23:00](#msg5a87628cc3c5f8b90dc53d1d)Looks like I'm having problems with my internet..

greggirwin

[23:01](#msg5a8762d3a2194eb80d71e563)Gitter doesn't like that. I know.

geekyi

[23:16](#msg5a87663d0202dc012e4432d0)Yeah, It's I think, the basic idea behind (typed) functional programming.  
&gt; what is the big win over, say, a general pattern-action dispatcher

A dispatcher simplifies api is what I meant. So the argument reduces down to `pattern-action` vs `type-action`.  
There, I'm not sure, because I find both suitable, for different tasks.

But I'll try to make my case tho:

Pattern matching is useful for (one or more of):  
\- limited number of cases  
\- text

Types:  
\- lots of different cases  
\- easily matches 1:1 with a (data) type  
\- few or no edge cases

So, for `parse` and `case` like stuff, pattern matching. For the rest, types make the api simpler. However, in redbol, there aren't that many different types (`series!` is the only collection type) and it is already pretty functional. So doesn't add much..

[23:18](#msg5a8766b9a2194eb80d71f9c2)@greggirwin  
&gt; a general pattern-action dispatcher (where the patterns could match simple arg types, but could also do more)?

Actually, I'm not sure what you mean here; if you can match by arg type, that's what I mean. Your version could be simpler

[23:41](#msg5a876c13a2194eb80d721a37)&gt; it does not really work unless red allows for user defined types/objects instead of anonymous objects

To be precise, what you actually need at a minimum is `attributes`, or metadata on types/objects. Alternatively, you can call them type `property`s or `traits`. Thinking a bit abstract here: usually these features are , but a few somewhat concrete examples:

\## Performance

```
a: unique [5 4 3]
b: sort [1 2 3 ]
```

`a` is a set with the uniqueness property, `b` is a list that has the property of being sorted.  
So far, you don't see the advantage over normal code.

But, in this particular case, both of these operations are idempotent. So, an implementation that specializes on type can generate optimize code (no-op) in this case.

\## Simpler api  
`load` is already very simple as is. Can it be simpler(more convenient) tho? What if it dispatches based on the file format/extension/content type?  
For example, based on the file extension / file contents, can you dispatch on `load/as %file.jpg 'jpg` so it's just `load %file.jpg`

\## Better extensibility  
Right now, if you want to extend a function, you have to rewrite it. Fortunately, this is much less painful (not to mention even being possible!)  
But if you multiple dispatch, you can write the `spec` once, implementation eslewhere multiple times!

JacobGood1

[23:52](#msg5a876eca8f1c77ef3a16d342)@geekyi "To be precise, what you actually need at a minimum is attributes, or metadata on types/objects." yep

[23:53](#msg5a876f02888332ee3a91651a)i love the way it is done in lisp, dynamic multi-methods on the outside of objects

geekyi

[23:57](#msg5a876ff435dd17022eb37054)Typo in first paragraph:  
&gt; a bit abstract here: usually these are different features*  
named and implemented differently depending on the programming language, but the same to me at a higher level of abstraction

## Saturday 17th February, 2018

greggirwin

[03:31](#msg5a87a21ac3c5f8b90dc6854a)Performance is a separate issue. Let's focus on the interface aspect.

The `load/as` example isn't great, because `load` already handles that as you want. `/as` is an override, if the file extension isn't mapped to a codec.

&gt; Right now, if you want to extend a function, you have to rewrite it.

You have to extend it, not necessarily rewrite it. This is maybe where you see the CL approach as an advantage, in that if you want to change the interface to a built-in you write a new version of the func, yes? And the original remains untouched.

&gt; But if you multiple dispatch, you can write the spec once, implementation eslewhere multiple times!

This is where the examples I found look like a lateral move to me. Not better, just different. e.g. given the wikipedia example:

```
(defmethod collide-with ((x asteroid) (y asteroid))
   ;; deal with asteroid hitting asteroid
   )
 (defmethod collide-with ((x asteroid) (y spaceship))
   ;; deal with asteroid hitting spaceship
   )
 (defmethod collide-with ((x spaceship) (y asteroid))
   ;; deal with spaceship hitting asteroid
   )
 (defmethod collide-with ((x spaceship) (y spaceship))
   ;; deal with spaceship hitting spaceship
   )
```

How is it better than something like this?

```
collide: func [a b][
    dispatch [a b] [  ; dispatch ~= parse reduce 
        [asteroid asteroid]   (...)
        | [asteroid spaceship]  (...)
        | [spaceship asteroid]  (...)
        | [spaceship spaceship] (...)
        | (default handler)
    ]
]
```

Of course, we're not matching by object class as CLOS is, which is a question of fundamentals. But what we get in return is, given any block of values as a spec, we can dispatch based on any criteria we want via `parse`, yes? I have old, and some newer, things that use this approach, which I hope to do more with in the near future.

[03:45](#msg5a87a5618f1c77ef3a17d85c)The object metadata aspect is the interesting part. Interesting because it raises the question of how objects are "typed" (e.g. duck typing), and because "why should objects be special?" That is, why don't blocks get metadata too? How do we "type" things in Red? We do it by value type. We can do more of course, because we have `parse`.

Two thought experiments to ruin your weekend:

1\) How to "parse" object defs to pattern match? I'm not the only one with experiments here.

2\) Why use objects for dispatching at all? Do we need to? Did someone say "dynamic multi-methods on the outside of objects"?

JacobGood1

[13:14](#msg5a882ab7e4ff28713a8b9721)because collide itself must be altered in order to make an extension to collide, with lisp you are not altering the original implementation

greggirwin

[16:33](#msg5a88595535dd17022eb800f3)I understand that, I just don't see \*yet* how it's a better fit in Red. Other langs do something similar (to CLOS), from an interface perspective, yes? Or have implemented in to emulate CLOS. So we should be able to dig up some good stories about the pros and cons. @JacobGood1 @geekyi @maximvl (or anyone else), what are your best personal stories about how this has helped you on real projects?

When you use this in real life, in CLOS, do you keep all the definitions for `collide` (e.g.) together? Or as you add new types, do you add new `collide`implementations with the code for each new type (much as Red does with datatype actions today)?

JacobGood1

[18:12](#msg5a887096a2194eb80d774db1)@greggirwin you create an interface first,

```
(defgeneric blah blah blah)
```

, you refer back to this when you need to know what the functions purpose is. The implementation of the function can take place anywhere, it is the users preference. I tend to keep them together, but it really depends on the project as with anything.

"Or as you add new types, do you add new collide implementations "  
Depends, clos has full blown multiple inheritance with method combinations, so you could just inherit from whatever object's implementation of that method that you desire to have for your object.

[18:37](#msg5a887687a2194eb80d7805fb)@greggirwin here is a paper that I have linked a few times, it is more amenable to the prototype object approach: http://sauerbraten.org/lee/ecoop.pdf

[18:46](#msg5a88786a35dd17022eb9460a)"Of course, we're not matching by object class as CLOS is, which is a question of fundamentals"  
It is also a question of performance, unless that is not a concern. The CLOS model has good performance, which may not be a concern to all, but it is to me.  
Robert Strandh has made some great strides in improving the speed of CLOS even further: http://metamodular.com/generic-dispatch.pdf  
Christian Schafmeister and him have been working on a new implementation of common lisp, clasp. They have incorporated these CLOS improvements into clasp, so they actually work. At this point, clasp has one of the fastest generic dispatch infrastructures for common lisp, here is a video where he talks about some of this stuff and a whole lot of chemistry: https://vimeo.com/156442057 go to around 36 for clasp discussion.

[20:59](#msg5a8897ade4ff28713a8e8789)I see multi dispatching as a very powerful way of constructing and extending the code in fact some languages eg Julia took it as a central, language-defining concept

[21:00](#msg5a889801888332ee3a97d200)also it simplifies code a lot, makes it more readable - instead of having a tree of conditions in a single function you just write several implementations

[21:03](#msg5a88988ee4ff28713a8e8afc)from my own experience it really helped me once when I was working with CL XMPP implementation and it was an old library which didn't support some mandatory modern messages, it was extremely easy to add this support in my code without touching the original library using multi dispatch (this was possible because each message is a class in this library)

[21:09](#msg5a889a1fc3c5f8b90dcc2eec)@9214 it's a user-oriented approach for sure :D

9214

[21:10](#msg5a889a4e8f1c77ef3a1d4bcf)IIRC, there two paths:

\* you have a bunch of datatypes, each supports a defined set of operations; whenever new datatype is presented it just need to implement a set of operations which it wants to support

[19:03](#msg5a89ce19c3c5f8b90dd20059)Thanks for all the info guys! I don't have time to watch the ~2:0:0 Clasp video, but any key points would be great to know.

&gt; clos has full blown multiple inheritance with method combinations, so you could just inherit from whatever object's implementation of that method that you desire to have for your object.

@jacobgood1, so it's truly a mixed system, as earlier you said

&gt; i love the way it is done in lisp, dynamic multi-methods on the outside of objects

But you can also inherit if you want.

&gt; also it simplifies code a lot, makes it more readable - instead of having a tree of conditions in a single function you just write several implementations

@maximvl, that's subjective, but I understand what you mean. I like not having to touch working code, but I don't see this as a free lunch. Still working on it though.

@rebolek, your code made my head explode first thing in the morning. :^)

I remembered the ecoop paper once I saw Sharks mentioned. I even found my old PMD notes on it from Aug-2016 @jacobgood1.

I imagine I didn't pursue it, because the CLOS model is deeply tied to objects and their specific classes, including user defined objects. That's great for consistency, but not a great fit for Red as it stands. Objects are important values, but OOP isn't Red's primary model.

One thing that makes it trickier is typesets. There is talk of total ordering vs partial ordering, and how the dispatch has to be designed to choose. But we could define ambiguous interfaces, yes? So that has to be accounted for. e.g.

```
fn-a: func [x [number!] y [number!]][print 'a]
fn-b: func [x [integer!] y [number!]][print 'b]
fn-c: func [x [number!] y [float!]][print 'c]
fn-d: func [x [float!] y [integer!]][print 'd]
; etc.
```

We also have to consider free ranging evaluation and refinements.

None of this is to say we can't do it, or have a lib to do something like it, but it needs a champion to show how it would work and look at the big picture. Any notes we make here, including resource references, would be great to put in a wiki page, so we know what we've talked about.

rebolek

[19:27](#msg5a89d3bbc3c5f8b90dd21f69)Looking at your fn-a - fn-d example, I guess that `all` should be automatic so it could be rewritten as

dispatch :fn [integer? x number? y][print 'a]
dispatch :fn [number? x float? y][print 'a]

```

greggirwin

[19:28](#msg5a89d3cca2194eb80d7eb1f2)I have a number of other things along this line, looking at the pattern-action model in different domains (tuplespace, FRP, observer pattern, evented matching), which I hope to coalesce into something that works well generally.

[19:29](#msg5a89d41d35dd17022ebfec8e)@rebolek, could work that way too. In my old notes from 2016, I have something like this:

```

[19:55](#msg5a8b2b9a6fba1a703a737098)I thought about removal, but you either need an ID or to match the stored body/func to find it again, yes? Otherwise you risk removing an entry with matching types.

rebolek

[20:49](#msg5a8b386fe4ff28713a9cef18)@greggirwin see last example above, rule is needed for removal with `none` as body (action) to trigger it. You can't have two actions with same rule, because passing an action with already existing rule will overwrite it.

[21:04](#msg5a8b3bd4c3c5f8b90ddab92e)I should also note that this approach is refinement transparent.

JacobGood1

[21:51](#msg5a8b46c98f1c77ef3a2bb7e0)@greggirwin "But you can also inherit if you want."  
Think of it more like an object becomes multiple types so the function that was written for a certain type can dispatch on another object that shares that type.

arbitrary example:  
If i wrote a bunch of multi-methods for a vector I could combine player and vector so that now I can call all the vector functions on the player, player would be both a vector and a player.

[13:55](#msg5a8c28dde4ff28713aa1addc)The acronym CLOS does not fit well with CLOS either because there is a huge difference between OOP in something like java vs CLOS

dander

[17:49](#msg5a8c5fae0202dc012e5fb371)I've been thinking it would be nice to do an experiment where some of the existing sequence processing functions (such as `foreach`, `append` etc) could be extended to also allow taking `function!` as the sequence argument. This would be possible by replacing the existing methods, but feels somewhat heavy-handed. I presume having multiple dispatch would make it easier? Would that scenario be a reasonable use case?

greggirwin

[18:22](#msg5a8c67736f8b4b99469c9c96)@dander, that is the idea behind it, yes. You can define new specs for a func of the same name, but there are limitations. @maximvl @JacobGood1 would have to confirm, but you can't, e.g., change the arity, because the "original" defines the interface to that extent, as I understand it. That, of course, gets into the realm of currying and things like transducers in Clojure.

dander

[18:33](#msg5a8c6a108f1c77ef3a31e510)In this case, I just want to add a new type to the existing spec:

```
>> probe spec-of :foreach
[
    "Evaluates body for each value in a series" 
    'word [word! block!] "Word, or words, to set on each iteration" 
    series [series! function!] 
    body [block!]
]
```

So a passed-in function could be treated as a series (take values from it until it returns `none`).  
I wanted to suggest this as a potential concrete use case. It's a lot more relevant if you have some \[generator functions](https://gist.github.com/dander/66ad65555b30286115cee675b16bf1d7) to feed it with. I still need to really clean that gist up...

greggirwin

[18:34](#msg5a8c6a2ce4ff28713aa390c1)I see \*how* it works, and understand the reasoning and flexibility. Since it's just a thought experiment for me right now, I'm still working through the pros and cons in practice, in the context of Red. Adding new datatypes, or usertypes, means you have to update actions in all types that want to add support. So you have to touch existing code and add logic. But if you use the MD/MM approach, those changes (if you don't want to touch existing code) will now live outside the original datatype.

Right now, it still looks \*different* but not \*better* in my head. Different tradeoffs. And I don't know how we'd make it work all the way down without a big redesign of datatypes in general. That is, it works well when it's central to how the host language works, but can you transplant it equally well?

[18:37](#msg5a8c6b016f8b4b99469cb73b)@dander it's a great concrete use case, and helpful. But we can't treat functions and series the same, so there has to be a change in the body logic (which is the MM/MD approach's goal). But is that a win over a separate `map/map-each` function? It opens a lot of questions.

[18:40](#msg5a8c6bba0202dc012e60087b)- Is it something the average programmer can understand and use effectively?  
\- Where is it most useful (e.g. small apps vs large, complex code bases)?  
\- If mostly useful in PitL, what are its counterparts that might be used instead?  
\- Does it need to be multi-dispatch all the way down, or is a lib/dialect enough for those who really need it?

dander

[18:57](#msg5a8c6f92888332ee3aacaf92)@greggirwin To me, `foreach` is more of a side-effecting process. "for each of the items in some atomically divisible thing, perform some operation", where the `map`/`map-each` functions are treated more functionally (implying no side effects), so there are some specific features you gain with them, like being able to chain and compose them with other functional methods. I typically try to use functional/HOF things to mold the raw inputs to something that I can feed into a `foreach`

[18:58](#msg5a8c6ff153c1dbb743548d5a)I think the benefit of keeping it in `foreach` is that it allows the `foreach` to stay focused on what it is for (iterating over a sequence (not the type) of things), versus the mechanics of what it can take.

[19:05](#msg5a8c71606fba1a703a7a9fe2)I think @JacobGood1 once posted this link, which I thought was interesting: \[Multimethods, Multiple Inheritance, Multiawesome!](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2011/04/21/multimethods-multiple-inheritance-multiawesome/)

greggirwin

[19:10](#msg5a8c72a16fba1a703a7aa81e)@dander the FP aspect is a good one, but then that seems to say `foreach` \*shouldn't* support funcs, because they shouldn't be "effectable", yes?

[19:11](#msg5a8c72fc53c1dbb743549f55)Of course, it would be useful inside, say, a `collect`.

[19:14](#msg5a8c738ea2194eb80d8e14aa)I'm not saying `foreach` \*shouldn't* support funcs, just thinking out loud.

[19:15](#msg5a8c73d98f1c77ef3a3227e5)And this will nicely lead into generators and whether we need to be lazy.

[19:16](#msg5a8c741d8f1c77ef3a322a28)Because if we don't need to be lazy, it's almost a moot point, yes?

dander

[19:18](#msg5a8c747753c1dbb74354a861)I tend to use the `foreach` as the consumer of a chain of functional transformations. The transformations can be nicely composed to describe how your inputs need to be filtered/transformed, but then you need to do something useful with them, like print out the results, or update a DB or whatever

[19:19](#msg5a8c74b3888332ee3aacd4f7)it's certainly possible to be too lazy ;) but sometimes it's a nice feature to have

[19:22](#msg5a8c7572c3c5f8b90de1ae5e)I think the lazy-by-default argument is kind of similar to the copy-on-write thing. You lose a little bit of performance because of the extra function calls, but you \_sometimes_ gain a lot when you don't need the whole sequence

greggirwin

[19:35](#msg5a8c78700202dc012e605eb2)Right, so it's a matter, today, of having to build a series from your chain first.

dander

[19:48](#msg5a8c7b936fba1a703a7add38)Yeah, and presumably if you have some sort of generator library, it will have a function that converts a generator sequence to a block (or other appropriate sequence) but if it is natively supported by `foreach` then you can short-circuit if it makes sense... Or going back to the MM thing, maybe the generator library would "upgrade" `foreach` along with half the things from `help "series"` with generator support

[06:38](#msg5ae5687f15c9b031144936b8)Is there any particular reason why people interested in Red also have an interest in Lisp ?

[06:44](#msg5ae569d57c3a01610d3103e7)Has anyone got any experience with Racket ? This here https://beautifulracket.com/ talks about how good Racket is for building your own language - anyone got any thoughts on how it compares with building languages in Red ?

pbaille

[09:59](#msg5ae5977f6d7e07082b46d6b0)@guraaku i think the metaprograming capabilities of Lisp (via macros) leads naturally to Red, which seems (at least to me, i'm new to red, but am a long time clojurian) to be more powerful than most lisps for building your own language. Kernel is an exception (a lisp with Fexprs)...

guraaku

[10:02](#msg5ae598511130fe3d362b8702)thanks @pbaille , I'm pretty new to Red too - am using it to implement a language previously implemented via a handwritten recursive descent parser in C#. I'm looking at different options, came across the Racket thing and just wondered if Red enthusiasts had any view on how it compared to Lisps

[10:04](#msg5ae598a262316e05050fe8b6)So far, yes, I'm finding Red to be very flexible, the little I have read so far from that Racket book looks more complicatedf

pbaille

[10:13](#msg5ae59ad47c3a01610d31a384)red is really something... it let you do so much things... I don't have the big picture yet, but I have searched a new language for a while, and the only that makes me feel the kind of joy that i have experienced learning lisp is Red. Syntax is beautiful, and it the core language is so powerfull... in lisp you have a sublanguage for implementing macros which is not so fine (i spoke for clojure), in red, you can do the same things (at runtime or compile time) more easily it seems.

guraaku

[10:14](#msg5ae59b1f62316e05050ff031)yes, that was the same feeling I have

greggirwin

[21:12](#msg5ae6355b7c3a01610d33d021)@guraaku Red inherits from Lisp, Forth, and Logo (also a Lisp), along with Self for the object model. It adds many new ideas, but offers many things Lisp does. This room is a good place to talk about what Lisp features match up, and how to offer things in Red (e.g. HOFs) that match Red's design.

[03:42](#msg5ae6909e15c9b031144d068d)lisp macros are still more powerful than red macros, however, the metaprogramming features of red are more user friendly

[03:43](#msg5ae690ee15c9b031144d0758)@pbaille "in lisp you have a sublanguage for implementing macros which is not so fine" that is not true, the reader macros only simplify what you would write by hand but they are not necessary.

[03:44](#msg5ae69126109bb0433215639a)I am sure that red macros will improve over time, but one cannot expect them to reach lisp potential due to the free form nature of red

pbaille

[06:44](#msg5ae6bb5815c9b031144da8dc)@JacobGood1 i was talking about the macro dsl ( ~ ' \` ~@ ...) which is not so fine in my opinion. My comparaison wasn't really between red macros vs lisp macros, but lisp macros vs red funcs (which can be viewed as runtime macros or fexprs i believe). I don't really know red macros, and for now don't feel the need to, since most commonly used lisp macros can be implemented with a simple func.

JacobGood1

[16:21](#msg5ae7428b5d7286b43a83371b)reds "runtime macros" are not as powerful, they do cover most use cases but not all

[16:36](#msg5ae74602270d7d3708208c80)i taught that red metaprograming approach was somehow analogous to Fexprs (which i believe is more general than macros) but maybe i'm wrong.

[16:38](#msg5ae7466c7c3a01610d3828bc)@pbaille that's true, Red and Rebol functions are close equivalents to fexprs.

JacobGood1

[18:04](#msg5ae75a9e7c3a01610d389268)@pbaille for one thing, only mezzanine(I think that is what they are called) functions are available for the creation of macros, while in lisp the whole language is available including anything you or anyone else have made. Another problem is expansion, since there are no syntactic clues as to when the expansion should occur, it will occur, by default, wherever the macro's symbol is found. There are other problems as well, but these are the easiest to digest.

[18:04](#msg5ae75ab5dad6fb186f01c9c3)@9214 yes, I have it somewhere...

pbaille

[18:25](#msg5ae75f8d5d7286b43a83cd1b)@JacobGood1 Forgive me i was not clear. I missused the word macro. For my practice, a macro is a meta-programming facility before being a compile time thing. so in fact i was comparing red functions with lisp macros. It does not make so much sense... With eval in lisp you can probably do what red functions do, also it is not encouraged, in red, code manipulation seems to be at the heart. In lisp (clojure specifically) macros and functions that call eval are marginal, and thinking of it, i'm not sure you can always tweak the environment before evaluating some expression in lisp at runtime (as the 'bind function of red seems to do). So the big thing is, in my point of view, the mindset in which red puts you (encouraging meta-programing) vs the mindset of lisp (functional?). in the red mindset macros are more interesting has a compile time unit than as a meta-programing tool, but in lisp it is not so clear... I hope to be clear, but i have some doubts! :p

JacobGood1

[19:26](#msg5ae76df95d7286b43a841474)Most people mean common lisp when using the word lisp, it does have a proprietary ownership of the .lisp extension after all =). Common lisp allows one to have environments of evaluation, which can be tweaked as much as desired. Lisp, historically, was not a very functional language at all, it was more of an oop one, oddly enough. As for as mindsets go, the clojure community does seem a little allergic to meta programming, however, the lisp community does not.

[07:40](#msg5ae819e4dea1b95c10f2e009)@JacobGood1 I understand, thanks for the clarifications!

JacobGood1

[16:21](#msg5ae8941f0a9c956f0419f4bd)Don't get me wrong though, I really like rebol/red/ren-c, there is something to be said about the simplicity of meta-programming in red, and programming in general in red. I would not be here if I did not like it. I do not really get to program in the language all that much, but when I do, it is very enjoyable. One thing I love about rebol, is the fact that parsing is a fundamental feature of the language, it is pretty ridiculous that this is not the case for most languages.

JacobGood1

[04:01](#msg5b1ca29814d4bc146e7acf04)Most languages have parsing in the form of a library. I do not know many languages that focus on parsing as part of their standard.  
Asking if I know of rebol like parsers... Most parsers I know of operate on strings almost exclusively, so I do not know of any other parser that has a duel mode such as rebol. However, there are many types of parsers, some of them do have benefits over rebol while simultaneously having deficits; there are no silver bullets.
