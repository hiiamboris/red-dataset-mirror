dockimbel

[10:11](#msg5c39bd3a0721b912a569c877)No, that's an auto-generated file. You should use `red clear` to force the refresh of libRedRT file when the export list, or the runtime code is modified.

dockimbel

[10:17](#msg5c39bec1cb47ec30002f4a51)Try `exec/gui/get-text-size`. `exec` is an internal context created by the compiler for the user code. IIRC, modules should also be wrapped in that context.

dockimbel

[10:35](#msg5c39c30632a8370605bc1c17)No, `tagSIZE` struct is only defined in the View module, inside libRedRT, so it's unknown in the main app that is importing the libRedRT API. I guess the only working option is the release mode.

hiiamboris

[10:37](#msg5c39c37032a8370605bc1ee5)okay, thank you!

dockimbel

[10:37](#msg5c39c37c1cb70a372ac76c0c)Though, that `get-text-size` function is called by the high-level `size-text`, why not use that one?

hiiamboris

[10:38](#msg5c39c3b3116bc43001f47134)I wanted a non-rounded &amp; non-scaled result from it (it saves it into a pair)

[10:39](#msg5c39c3f628513d605a13b966)Actually, let me bring it to your attention...

[10:41](#msg5c39c44b1cb70a372ac77256)`size-text` is measuring the \*actual* text size in a \*specific window\*. `para` settings apply, window width applies, etc, etc. It's good and useful and all, but! It's totally useless when I want a single character cell.

[10:42](#msg5c39c48b20b78635b60f3c60)In fact, since `draw` uses much more simple text rendering routine, `DrawText` that has no idea of the word 'formatting', so any result of `size-text` is incompatible with `draw [text ...]`.

[10:43](#msg5c39c4c339596c372bcc7f4e)I'm just saying that there's a need sometimes to know how much space `draw [text ..]` will occupy and no built in means for that.

[10:44](#msg5c39c5020999400604db6555)Keep it in mind for future design decisions â˜º

dockimbel

[10:52](#msg5c39c70439596c372bcc8dac)&gt; It's totally useless when I want a single character cell.

That's not clear. Do you mean that `size-text` does not work if you size a string of length 1?

[10:59](#msg5c39c87c1cb70a372ac78f2b)You should be able to use `size-text` on an invisible face to measure the size of `draw [text ...]`, as long as you provide the same font specifications. Otherwise, you can also try switching to rich-text mode in draw, and then `size-text` can return you the accurate text size from the rich-text face.

hiiamboris

[10:59](#msg5c39c8859fa58135b552df92)Yes. It's useless because of:  
1\) it scales results by DPI and then rounds them  
2\) it measures text inside the window, which seemingly takes into account a few pixels of padding  
3\) DrawText/GetTextExtentPoint is generally incompatible with higher level GdipMeasureString because of different metric algorithms, different font types (ClearType, Antialias on/off etc.), different proofing method for the same antialias mode...  
4\) lower level funcs are not constrained by the face width, the do not care about it at all (and so is `draw`), but `size-text` does (no problem for 1 char, but due to (1) I have to measure a 100x100 char array)

dockimbel

[10:59](#msg5c39c89832a8370605bc3b18)@qtxie probably has more insights to share on that topic.

[11:02](#msg5c39c95f95e17b45253c4ed0)So `size-text` does not have the same behavior for a one-character string and a string of two or more characters?

hiiamboris

[11:04](#msg5c39c9b2116bc43001f4942e)Yes, that in particular:

```
>> s: system/view/screens/1
>> size-text/with s "x"
== 12x17
>> size-text/with s "xx"
== 19x17
>> size-text/with s "xxx"
== 27x17
```

[11:05](#msg5c39c9deba355012a427eb23)The whole story about it is here: https://github.com/red/red/issues/3336

[11:06](#msg5c39ca1ecb47ec30002f9599)After that I also modified size-text to be more high level, like on MacOS backend, so it understands multiple lines now and formatting.

[11:06](#msg5c39ca5095e17b45253c541d)But the core issue remains, `draw` using different methods of output remains unpredictable.

[11:08](#msg5c39cabc1cb70a372ac79bac)And it's the simplest of cases, where the font is fixed-cell...

[11:09](#msg5c39cacf20b78635b60f64da)@dockimbel I didn't know btw that `draw` has a rich text mode. Is there any info on it?

dockimbel

[11:11](#msg5c39cb7f95e17b45253c5d56)From your ticket:  
&gt; So now there's no reliable solution to determine the glyph size of a fixed-size font

`size-text` was never meant for that anyway. It's returning the size of a given string as displayed on screen (taking into accountfont, para, ...).

hiiamboris

[11:13](#msg5c39cbefba5936605ba9d161)&gt; was never meant for that anyway

I understood that later :)

[11:14](#msg5c39cc339fa58135b552f664)`text-box-metrics` is using D2D functions, so it again will be different from plain `draw [text]`

[11:20](#msg5c39cd8939596c372bccb5f6)

qtxie

[11:21](#msg5c39cdc932a8370605bc5d0a)@hiiamboris @dockimbel I was thinking add a refinement to `size-text/pixel`, it will return text size in pixel.

hiiamboris

[11:23](#msg5c39ce1f32a8370605bc6126)@qtxie Good idea, but it won't solve problems (2)-(4)

qtxie

[11:23](#msg5c39ce4d8318994524d921c6)@hiiamboris Did we change the text drawing function to GDI+? If not, we can change it, so the drawing function and the measuring function are in the same system.

hiiamboris

[11:25](#msg5c39cec1ba5936605ba9e1f1)Yes, `base` is drawn with GDI+. All in all, GDI+ is by far better at predicting face's text size. Not totally compatible, but in most applications being off by 1-2 pixels is okay.

[11:26](#msg5c39cef2cb47ec30002fb473)`draw` still uses GDI.

[11:28](#msg5c39cf6a0721b912a56a3b64)See my comparison btw https://github.com/red/red/issues/2503#issuecomment-447576716

Worth making an issue?

qtxie

[11:30](#msg5c39cfe90721b912a56a3e25)We use GDI+ in draw, but just for image context. I think it's OK to use GDI+ for face too.

dockimbel

[11:32](#msg5c39d03cba5936605ba9ec60)@hiiamboris Your usage of rich-text is incorrect there, a rich-text face object should be at the place where `"A"` is.

[11:32](#msg5c39d06a0999400604dba7f2)@qtxie Do we have any rich-text examples in the %red/tests folder, I can't find any? I also can't find your old examples for rich-text...

hiiamboris

[11:35](#msg5c39d0faba355012a4281a70)Well, the doc above said: `: a string, or a rich-text face object with a rich-text description in single-box mode.` Not implemented?

qtxie

dockimbel

[11:37](#msg5c39d17539596c372bccce29)@hiiamboris It is just the extended copy of the `text` command description. `a string` is the existing default behavior of `text`. The added behavior is the rich-text face.

dockimbel

[11:44](#msg5c39d32735350772cf1c3211)So basically, you wrap the rich text into a `rich-text` face, and you use that in Draw instead of a string.

dockimbel

[11:52](#msg5c39d4fe116bc43001f4df7c)@hiiamboris It's not related to `size-text`, the rich-text face properties are somehow wrong.

dockimbel

[11:55](#msg5c39d5bcba355012a4283905)@hiiamboris IIRC, that's wrong, the rich-text face inside Draw needs to be specific for each `text` command, it cannot be a displayed face like `f`.

[12:05](#msg5c39d8068318994524d95b72)In multi-box mode, the `rich-text` can contain several different rich-text paragraphs, each defined as a face argument to `text`.

qtxie

[12:09](#msg5c39d8ed9fa58135b55343c9)@hiiamboris When using it in draw, rich-text is a graphic object (not a face), just like `circle`, `box`, `image`, etc. It can be measured standalone, no need to be associated to a face.

[12:11](#msg5c39d95d95e17b45253cb30c)So if the face is a canvas, you can draw many `rich-text` on it, just like you can draw many `circles`.

[12:12](#msg5c39d9c61cb70a372ac7fdf6)IIRC, when using it as a graphic object, you can also set the size of `rich-text` to 0x0, that means no bounding box for rich-text.

dockimbel

[12:13](#msg5c39d9f239596c372bcd01fc)We need a proper documentation for rich-text usage, the wiki page is only a spec...

hiiamboris

[12:14](#msg5c39da0f28513d605a143f7b)@qtxie Yeah I understand. I was just pointing out that multi-box is not working with `size-text`. Not that it solves the scaling/rounding problem... Want a new issue about size-text and multi-box? It'll then be the 4th I raise today â˜º

qtxie

dockimbel

[12:19](#msg5c39db4795e17b45253cbbf7)For the record, the "paragraph" face is never displayed, but used as a container only for the rich-text info + string to display in one of boxes of the multi-box mode:

```
f: rtd-layout [red "A"]
g: rtd-layout [blue "B"]

[12:20](#msg5c39db749fa58135b553531c)So better call that "inner" face `paragraph` or anything else than `rich-text`, otherwise it becomes very confusing.

[12:22](#msg5c39dbf028513d605a1449d1)I think `rtd-layout` should have a refinement for that, maybe `/box` refinement with a `size` argument, to set the `/size` facet and return a face with `/type: 'box` or `/type: 'paragraph`.

[12:23](#msg5c39dc35ba355012a4286464)@hiiamboris So, rich-text (with underlying D2D) does not return a proper size either?

`SET_RETURN(X)` is a runtime macro alias for `stack/set-last as red-value! X`. @toomasv never made it clear why he added `return as red-string!` portion.

[07:58](#msg5c9dd025dfcacf510abada88)The reason was it didn't work otherwise. Quite probably I did something wrong (\[here](https://github.com/toomasv/send-keys/blob/master/win-shell.red#L230)), but being very dumb in RS it was the result of lots of T&amp;E.

[11:07](#msg5c9dfc84a100047111db4308)@toomasv It doesn't make sense to use `return` in a routine and do type casting if you want to pass argument to top-level Red. All what is needed is to allocate a cell on evaluation stack, and this is what `SET_RETURN(...)` does.

[11:09](#msg5c9dfccee422d15199317a47)I might be wrong though, but in your case compiler got angry at the fact that your spec declairs a return type but you don't actually return anything.

caller: function [] [result: bridge "why?" print mold result]

caller
```

`bridge` doesn't return the block `[1]` rather than the somewhat uncalled for string `why?`.

I guess it has to do with how arguments are handled on the Red/System stack. But I didn't manage to find some helpfull explanation in the docs. Any hints here?

[19:56](#msg5ce0636863dea422b4a64c8b)Hi everybody. I am new to Red and Red/System. I have been trying to make some binding to different dlls but it is a lot of trial and error since I don't really know how to map native types to red types. Binding simple apis works fine as long as the types are simple. Binding examples help a bit, but I still have no clue for this case where I have to pass a value by reference in order to retrieve some data.  
In C the call is done like this:

```
midiInGetDevCaps(i, &caps, sizeof(MIDIINCAPS))
```

and MIDIINCAPS is

```
typedef struct {
  WORD Â Â Â Â Â wMid;
  WORD Â Â Â Â Â wPid;
  MMVERSION vDriverVersion;
  TCHAR Â Â Â Â szPname[MAXPNAMELEN];
  DWORD Â Â Â Â dwSupport;
} MIDIINCAPS;
```

I have tried mapping with a struct! using mostly integer! but when I pass that to the api, my program just seems to crash with no error message. What I mean by crash is that this code:

```
print-line "==== START ====="
winmm-device-names device-id caps winmm-device-count
print-line "====  END  ====="
```

won't write anything to the console, not even the "start" and "end", while calling other APIs .  
Do you have any hint on how I can map theses type with R/S and get debug information?  
Thanks.

[23:19](#msg5ce092e96366992a94e0d32c)@Softknobs

&gt; I don't really know how to map native types to red types

Do not confuse Red with Red/System. Red values are boxed structures of fixed size, and don't have a direct mapping to native C types. Red/System, on the other hand, is C-level language; it has a more limited set of types, compared to C, but you can emulate the missing ones with structs, pointers and some bit-trickery.

&gt; I still have no clue for this case where I have to pass a value by reference

See \[Section 4.8](https://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html#section-4.8) in Red/System spec, which explains how to declare and use pointers. Structs are passed by reference.

&gt; my program just seems to crash with no error message

Start with putting your code in a gist and writing a small example, so we can reproduce the crash and help you. \[Here](https://gitter.im/red/red/welcome?at=5cb759866a84d76ed8ac9939) are some additional resources on R/S to get you started. Additionally, try to compile your program with `-d` flag, and see if it gives you any clues; also, bear in mind that Red is limited to 32-bit at this point.

The most obvious mistake is that you use `cdecl` instead of `stdcall` calling convention (which is AFAIK used by Windows API). You also pass integer `1` instead of integer pointer (`uDeviceID`) and number of available MIDI devices instead of `MIDIINCAPS` struct's size (`cbMidiInCaps`).

But there are things that i do not understand:  
The "length? of buf" is only 1 but the characters number returned by the API is exactly "6".  
If i use "6" i get only "it-" so i have to use "6 * 2" to get "it-IT".  
The content of Red string returned by the routine is "i t - I T" and not "it-IT".  
Any suggestion? Thanks

[16:20](#msg5cf002da7c1dab468c71ee6c)&gt; The "length? of buf" is only 1 but the characters number returned by the API is exactly "6".

Red/System uses ASCII encoding, whereas Windows API uses UTF-16LE encoding. `length?` just returns a number of bytes up to null byte, and the very first null is contained in the upper-half of `I` binary representation (2 bytes).

&gt; If i use "6" i get only "it-" so i have to use "6 * 2" to get "it-IT".

As I said, Windows uses UTF-16LE encoding, with 2 bytes per character. `it-` is 3 characters (6 / 2).

&gt; The content of Red string returned by the routine is "i t - I T" and not "it-IT".

Because you haven't converted it properly from UTF-16 to UTF-8 (encoding used by Red strings). Spaces probably are null bytes.

hiiamboris

[11:52](#msg5cf11581ff3f016baa7f393c)@9214 if I may correct you a tiny bit â˜º  
String literals defined in R/S are UTF-8 encoded because that's the source file encoding (although from R/S point of view those are just bytes not chars, so you can loosely call that ASCII).  
But if I'm getting it right, Red strings can internally be Latin-1, UCS-2 or UCS-4 (these are all fixed-length encodings, so simple length calculations are working) and are promoted on the fly when required.

9214

[12:07](#msg5cf1190fbf4cbd167c08cb33)@hiiamboris per R/S specs:  
&gt; For now, Red/System uses 8-bit character encoding (ASCII). Once proper Unicode support will be provided by the Red language layer, Red/System will switch to UTF-8 source encoding.

[12:10](#msg5cf119c0faac643934183520)I'm not sure if this relates to `c-string!`s though. In the above examples I guess it's okay to call them ASCII encoded, since each character fits in one byte and ASCII is a subset of UTF-8.

[21:14](#msg5d3778b1ec5abe7bbc37adde)I feel like I am missing some important parts of the R/S documentation: I see references here an there to string/rs-head and string/load but nothing is mentioned about these in the language specification page. I am stuck with a `Access Error: invalid UTF-8 encoding: #{90394104}` error trying to convert a c-string! coming from an external C program to string! using `red-port-name: string/load c-port-name size UTF-8` and I don't know if I am using string/load correctly. I suspect it is because the c-string! is an array and not a real string but I have no idea if there are alternatives to string/load to convert the c-string!. Thanks.

9214

[21:21](#msg5d377a60e2d1aa6688f90312)@Softknobs `string/rs-head` and `string/load` are a part of Red runtime library written in Red/System (see \[here](https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/runtime/datatypes/string.reds#L1121)), and therefore are not covered by R/S documentation. \[Here](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/\[DOC]-Guru-Meditations#convert-c-string-to-red-string) you can find a conversion example (that is, assuming that your `c-string!` is properly encoded and does not require extra conversion).

Softknobs

[21:34](#msg5d377d508fe53b671dc57a57)@9214 Thanks I'll browse the runtime code, that's interesting. I my case the c-string! is not a text string, it is used as an array of bytes and it may not be a valid "string". I can get each value by iterating over it but since c-string! is the only "array" type available this makes it difficult to pass as a whole to Red code as a single parameter. What do you mean by "extra conversion"?

9214

[21:42](#msg5d377f2f1dc6332966007110)@Softknobs `string/load` converts UTF-8 encoded `c-string!` to `red-string!` (a Red-level string value). So, if your array of bytes is not a proper UTF-8 `c-string!`, then conversion will fail (and it does, as evident from the error message). You probably want to convert it to `binary!` instead, using \[`binary/load`](https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/runtime/datatypes/binary.reds#L933) and passing a byte pointer to `c-string!`.

I don't know if this is the intended behaviour of the binary/load but if the last value converts to 0, it is ignored. So when 3 bytes are read and, for example, #{904000} is expected, only the first two bytes (#{9040}) are returned.

9214

[21:16](#msg5d3a1c216f384439765cf670)@Softknobs note that `length?` on `c-string!` ignores trailing null byte. Try to use `size?` instead, but bear in mind that, per R/S specs:  
&gt; `size?` can only be used on a literal c-string, when only a c-string pointer is available use `length?` function.

Softknobs

[21:39](#msg5d3a219517279f5506b8ccd2)@9214 In this case the 0 value that comes from an external dll seems to be considered as "NULL" in the c-string context. I guess there is no way for Red to see the difference in this case. This only happens when 0 is the last value, other 0 values are converted correctly (ex: #{090010} middle 0 value remains). Anyway size? does the trick. Thanks for your help.

[21:50](#msg5d5876aa4e17537f524f55be)Just a piece of advice to beginners in R/S: note that every example saying the -r parameter is required can also use the -u and -c afterwards.  
Maybe this is obvious to experienced R/S developers but I found it by accident. This means that the compilation with -u will take a bit more time than -r the first time you compile your script but just a few seconds on subsequent compilations since you can use the -c parameter.  
In my case compiling anything with -r takes around 90 seconds and I almost gave up Red althogether just because of compilation time in trial and error debugging phases...  
I don't think this is clearly mentionned in the R/S documention but I just found this blog post about this behaviour while writting this message: https://www.red-lang.org/2017/03/062-libred-and-macros.html

[22:16](#msg5d587ca69507182477fa5618)Also, note that usage of new runtime calls in your code (after `-u`) requires rebuilding of a new custom libRedRT, which in turn requires cleanup with `red clean` command.

[22:20](#msg5d8be834cdbb7d4f7888d6b0)I require a systems programming language for an upcoming project of mine. I like Red a lot as a language so I figured I would use Red/System; however, I'm finding it hard to justify using it over Rust. Rust offers safety features such as its borrow checker, and it doesn't seem like memory-safety or thread-safety is planned to be implemented in Red/System. So does anyone know if there are any plans to implement any safety features in Red/System sometime in the future?

greggirwin

[22:29](#msg5d8bea5986eddb6ea0d51e07)Red/System will likely stay at the C level, maybe with some features added in the future, but more "advanced" system level dialects may be done as experimental or permanent variants of R/S. e.g. there could be a Red/System/Safe version that adds memory safety features and compiles to R/S. It could probably even be done with macros.

One of the issues is that you have to give things up to get safety, even Rust does, so R/S will always be kept simple and unsafe, like C.

9214

[22:31](#msg5d8beab3f8b2736b387733df)@psahani21\_gitlab you're comparing apples to oranges. R/S was designed to give user full control (foot-shooting and all), with tight Red integration in mind - it's not even a language per se, but a system programming DSL. All safety features are postponed for R/S 1.0 experiments.

[22:33](#msg5d8beb5486eddb6ea0d523b5)Another thing is why try to apply Rust mindset where it doesn't fit? R/S is unsafe by design, but Red \_is_ safe by design; so, combine both (that was the initial idea anyway).

There will surely be some very low level bits that might need some custom support in the R/S compiler, but that's a future conversation.

[12:21](#msg5d9c7f4749c7720aaf8818df)R/S (pre-Red 1.0) is supposed to serve only as a low-level layer for Red using a throw-away implementation in Rebol, so many features that we could add were left out. Once we get the toolchain ported to Red, then we can add many extra features. You can use `pointer! [integer!]` as an alias to `pointer! [logic!]`, so strictly speaking a "logic! pointer is not needed". ;-)

&gt; So does anyone know if there are any plans to implement any safety features in Red/System sometime in the future?

R/S provides already type-safety, which is the most important one. For Rust-like "memory safety" features, they are a bad match for R/S as stated by Vladimir, as R/S aims to give full control over the hardware (going even further than C language). Once we add proper array support, you'll get bound-checking. A full-blown borrow-checker could be considered for experimentation, but not by copying the over-complicated approach from Rust.  
If you really require a "system programming language" for your project, you are likely to interface with low-level hardware and/or system libraries, which means using unsafe mode in Rust. For thread-safety, we have a theoretical solution for that, if the prototype proves it viable, we should have it before 1.0.

[19:21](#msg5daa109ec86aec24c667fa9e)Thanks for the hint. I already tried to make the whole code blocking and it works. The problem then in the server usage: If an upload is being processed, the server can no longer process other requests. This is why I am looking for alternatives but maybe there is no simple way to do this at this time.

[19:33](#msg5daa136dfa637359fca0d9e1)@Softknobs, @qtxie has done some work in a private branch, but it isn't ready for public consumption yet. It sounds like you'll be a great candidate for testing it though.
