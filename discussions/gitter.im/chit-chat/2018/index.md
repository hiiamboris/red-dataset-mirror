[16:51](#msg5aa801a9a60157d62fe1d690)@maximvl, et al, Reddit is a fine channel. People can and should work where they are most comfortable, and we will (with luck) have community leaders in all those channels.

[16:55](#msg5aa80289458cbde5572d94db)Also, my net connection is bad this morning, and Gitter is pretty much useless right now. -1 for Gitter.

[19:18](#msg5aa823efc3c5f8b90d6a4eff)Probably should be a guru or near guru to field HN questions. And maybe reddit and quora

greggirwin

[23:19](#msg5aa85c8c458cbde5572f9ec9)Leaders in any channel can escalate requests if needed. It's the daily grind and filtering that's too much.

[00:49](#msg5abc380a27c509a774b4c62a)@9214 btw if you're going to attempt to evolve our iterator ideas, I think @dander's way is simpler, you just have to make it return unset! instead of none! and it's not limiting anymore

9214

[00:58](#msg5abc3a3ebb1018b37a37631a)@hiiamboris the main idea is to separate actual iteration from data format and specification, but actual implementation is free-form and up to me?

[00:59](#msg5abc3a64c4d0ae800711515a)Because whenever I hear "iterator" I recall Python and knee-jerk reaction kicks in :)

hiiamboris

[01:02](#msg5abc3b2335dd17022eaf6152)I hate Python too (: Worst thing to code in except maybe for Delphi

[01:03](#msg5abc3b5be3d0b1ff2c7b7408)Implementation is free form ofc

[01:04](#msg5abc3bad2b9dfdbc3a329127)but there's a reason I used a context with a fixed set of items  
you can reduce it to only two: `subject` and `advance` provided the latter will return unset! on no items

[01:05](#msg5abc3bc47c3a01610d861476)reason is this way I could reuse the existing context objects

BeardPower

[01:06](#msg5abc3c185f188ccc1509b8ef)Don't iterate me, bro! :smile:

[01:08](#msg5abc3c8c7c3a01610d861778)well I hated it for these nice libs were in permanently broken state, and docs were even more of a mess than in rebol :)

9214

[01:09](#msg5abc3cbb5f188ccc1509ba78)Personally, it's an extreme un-fun to code in.

[01:09](#msg5abc3cc87c3a01610d8617f4)Maybe we used a different set of libs ;-)

[01:19](#msg5abc3f14c574b1aa3e43af0a)AFAIK its free edition is kinda limited and opinionated.

[01:22](#msg5abc3fd3e4ff28713a8555d4)I actually think that the only right way to learn Forth is to build one from scratch.

[01:22](#msg5abc3febc574b1aa3e43b2f4)The classic threaded code version I mean.

Setting, pacing, secrets, tarot mechanics, AWESOME weaponry, nice soundtrack. And it's the only Polish FPS done right. ;)  
1\. Zanzarah - ah, Pokemons + Quake + simple quest/RPG. It's charming, just listen \[the main theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDSch2-1Z54)! The best and kindest part of my video game childhood.  
1\. BG&amp;E - getting old and repetitive over time, but the world and setting are still charming as they always was.  
1\. PoP:WW - it's sort of a Persian Painkiller, what more do you want? I also love plot twists with Dahaka and Sandwraith.  
1\. Dark Souls 1 - I played first part of the franchise this autumn and was deeply impressed by lore and level design. Gameplay is challenging and interesting too. Artorias is the best boss fight I ever experienced. Plan for NG+, not sure if it's the best investment of my time though :smile:  
1\. SOMA - Frictional Games magnum opus so far, as I said. No jumpscares, only insane and creepy narrative that terrifies you more deeply each time you think about it.

[12:42](#msg5ac8bcc027c509a774e8cf94)@toomasv what does it mean when one thing is an icon of another thing?

[12:42](#msg5ac8bccf92f5d62057a2c9d2)@greggirwin John Sowa's intro http://www.jfsowa.com/pubs/egtut.pdf

[12:45](#msg5ac8bd6c6d7e07082bcb681d)@9214 I understand it as icon representing its referent primarily by some physical characteristic; like photo is icon of the thing photographed. Or if you say "Mew" you make a vocal icon of cat, but here the representation is not so clear anymore. Instead, if you say/write `cat`, you make a symbol (i.e. conventional representation) of cat.

9214

[12:48](#msg5ac8be347c3a01610db94ce8)@toomasv so if something reminds me of something else, then it's an icon?

[12:49](#msg5ac8be62df3e0fb547b14514)I.e. iconicity helps to distinguish something from everything else.

toomasv

[12:52](#msg5ac8befb1130fe3d36b03587)It can be mixed. E.g. mark of fossil in/on stone is primarily an indexial representation (physical consequence), but represented on a photograph in science journal, or on exhibition, it becomes an icon.

[12:53](#msg5ac8bf3f27c509a774e8d6be)Every sign can (and does) remind you of something else, it is what it means to be a sign.

[12:54](#msg5ac8bf975f188ccc153d8834)@toomasv thanks. As I said, not light reading. ;^)

[12:56](#msg5ac8bff9080a3850530889f0)An icon, to me, is \*like* something, while a symbol \*represents* something.

toomasv

[13:01](#msg5ac8c111080a385053088e44)In peircean sense, icon represents by likness, symbol by convention, index by physical consequence. But they can be, and often are, mixed. But there are other uses of these words, of course.

nedzadarek

[15:45](#msg5aca39221130fe3d36b53fbb)@9214 it's interesting language. It's array operations are amazing!

9214

[15:54](#msg5aca3b1c2b9dfdbc3a6b1b7b)@nedzadarek brevity and richness of built-in primitives is batshit insane. And I love function compositions (trains/hooks/forks).

nedzadarek

[15:56](#msg5aca3bb65f188ccc15426c08)@9214 Yes, they are nice but things like `(((,[:+/_2&{.)@](^:(2-~[)))&1 1)`get me thinking: would you like to read that code few months later?

9214

[15:59](#msg5aca3c6a6bbe1d2739c496fb)@nedzadarek I see this kind of debates over and over in discussions about J. It takes some time to read J code (it's actually harder than to write it), but it pays back in a long term.

nedzadarek

[16:01](#msg5aca3ce06bbe1d2739c497ec)&gt; pays back in a long term

How? (I'll be back... later, sorry)

9214

[16:05](#msg5aca3dcf7c3a01610dbe5afb)@nedzadarek short feedback loop between you and your program. It takes fewer keystrokes to write code, and lesser time to read and refactor it.

nedzadarek

[20:19](#msg5aca796227c509a774eebcbd)@9214 but it takes much longer time to understand (parse) it when you don't remember all the stuff. I learned some of the J but I don't understand that code at all (maybe few symbols).  
I tried Haskell and I found fibonacci sequence in tacit style ( https://wiki.haskell.org/The\_Fibonacci\_sequence ): `fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)`. It's much simpler to understand for me.

&gt; It's much simpler to understand for me.

So what we're arguing here is subjective preference. It's not that hard to remember what each J primitive means. Moreover, these primitives is 90% of everything you ever gonna use, and this is a major factor.

hiiamboris

[07:14](#msg5acb12c9df3e0fb547b942c2)yeah let's instead code in binary... 0s and 1s - just two primitives to remember, isn't it the heaven? ;)

[07:18](#msg5acb13d8109bb04332a18b75)@hiiamboris that a set of expressive and well-designed primitives with short names isn't the same as coding in binary. The former is \*human notation\*, the latter is \*machine code\*.

[07:21](#msg5acb14876d7e07082bd39e21)I think @nedzadarek meant that there's reason we use language with clearly distinguishable letters and words and not just series of punctuation characters (which I idealized as binary)

Yes, it's little subjective.

&gt; I think @nedzadarek meant that there's reason we use language with clearly distinguishable letters and words and not just series of punctuation characters (which I idealized as binary)  
and the reason is in how our brains process visual data

I agree with you. We like naming stuffs.

&gt; Mental effort is the same, be it C or J

I disagree with you. People will recognize words like `if` or `while` . Indentation matters too (pseudocode):

```
if (a = (b + c)) [print "hello world"]
```

vs:

```
if (a = (b + c)) [
  print "hello world"
]
```

Add function:

```
if (foo?) [
  print "bye world"
]
```

ps. I mean normal code. You can write obfuscate code in a lot of languages.

&gt; Maybe when you read a book, but it's not the same as reading/writing code.

It's not the same but it might share similarities, e.g. `The ball is red` vs `ball = red`.

ps. and of course I can "divide and conquer" with J too: write some small functions and create bigger from them.

Volume is just the amount of contracts traded at a specific time.

[12:28](#msg5ae074507c3a01610d1c6f91)I'm playing around with double-linked list implementation, and want to pass (and modify) the head of the list by reference, rather than by value. To make this possible I need to use a pointer to a pointer. So, here's how I defined list's node:

```
struct node {
    int data;
    struct node *prev;
    struct node *next;
};
```

And here's a function that either points head to a newly created node (if it is null), or inserts new node at the head. Note that I pass a pointer to a pointer:

```
void insert(struct node **head, int data){
    struct node *new = make(data);

    if (!head){ // I have no idea what I'm doing
        printf("!!!\n");
        *head = new;
    } else {
        (*head)->prev = new;
        new->next = *head;
        *head = new;
    }
}
```

Here's how I use it:

```
void main(){
    struct node *head;
    insert(&head, 1);
    show(head);
    insert(&head, 2);
    show(head);
}
```

The problem is - I already spent ~1 hour on it and still don't get how to check if head is null, i.e. if it doesn't point to some node.

2\. Yes, but it's only one leap (going to the pointer location).  
1\. It's not meaningless. Correct me if I'm wrong, but in C you cannot create dynamic arrays (or allocate variable amount of memory). If you don't know the size of your data (e.g. 10? 10000000?) then you cannot just allocate `10000000 * some_value`. You can allocate smaller part and "re allocate" it later but in worst case you would have to copy whole array.

ps. Of course nothing is perfect.

hiiamboris

[12:54](#msg5ae07aa21130fe3d3615b849)@BeardPower you believe changing `void *` to `int` will help? well, haven't tried that for sure ;)

BeardPower

[17:59](#msg5ae0c1eb2d0e228d7bb05131)lol now I even know \*why* it happened...  
I used malloc() to alloc some space for the objects and then used `(*p) = default_object` construct to init them, but `=` of course didn't know that `(*p)` contains junk, but thinks it's a valid object  
...complexity in action :)

While the ideas seems interesting he seems to be another language extremist (my language is the best)... more or less.

[16:37](#msg5ae4a33fb01085166ccf0256)What specific ideas? Tacit (aka point-free style) programming is a very common technique in functional languages, especially in concatenative ones. Operations on vectors and matrixes aren't new either, R, Julia and even Python use them, for example. Notation tailored to the problem field? It's what DSLs are, essentialy, and problem-oriented languages.

[16:38](#msg5ae4a36b2d0e228d7bc0e759)APL and J are as normal as any other language out there, believe me or not.

[16:22](#msg5b0443ccd332ee5fad3ba641)@hiiamboris I'm curious about D too, tracked it on my radar as a "saner C++ / better C" alternative for a while.

hiiamboris

[17:29](#msg5b045395e1cf621dba3d11fc)&gt; @hiiamboris this is theme more related for chit-chat group, but what do you dislike about D2?

@rebolek I remember when D1 was only only maturing, they argued that in C++ most features were not designed (initially) but emerged in the process of evolution, on top of C. They wanted to make better than C++, that became a monster.  
But when I look at D2 I see yet another monstrosity, and if C++ required 20-30 years to reach that stage, with D the process was way quicker. I look at the source code of any of their library files and ask myself: does this code clearly express the programmers intent? Unfortunately what I see looks like a result of heavy struggle. Where's the aesthetics in that?  
Sure it's still better than C++, but with the introduction of C++11 - only by a small margin. What I dislike is it's complexity. It does things differently a bit than C++ but the complexity of it stays the same. So then what's the point?  
I don't know, maybe the authors of D are not to blame, maybe it's the very concept of imperative OOP that leads to such complexity? Can't say that C# or Java or that idiocy of language Objective-C do any better.

BeardPower

[19:01](#msg5b046922e0b50c2d05e30b7e)@hiiamboris Well, "better than C++" in which regards? Fancy functional programming features? Memory management? Performance? Libraries? I think OOP is overused. It was fancy in the 90ties, praised to be the killer feature and trying to ease the understanding of code by wrapping everything into real world objects. A lot of code, which is not OOP is often easier and faster to write and maintain than the it's OOP variant. Languages try hard to maintain or even back developers in creating bloat instead of the contrary.

hiiamboris

[19:56](#msg5b0475d0f04ce53632fadb1d)@BeardPower native UCS32 strings and very straightforward strings/array slicing, native GC, silent NaN-aware floating point and complex number arithmetic, simpler templating and object construction/destruction/inheritance - that's what I like there

@BeardPower what you mean by "self-decision"?

9214

[23:20](#msg5b04a5a4ee623e2e41f6276a)@nedzadarek current AI is nothing but linear algebra backed with available CPU horse power. There's no 'intelligence', to put it bluntly, just adaptive algorithms trained on datasets.

BeardPower

[23:23](#msg5b04a6702942532e42d3d086)@nedzadarek Every algorithm is a fixed logic. Be it deep learning, decision trees, support vector machines or any other AI/learning method, the code has a deterministic output based on inputs. A true AI is able to decide to have a different output based on the same inputs. A true AI needs to be based on true randomness and non-deterministic algorithms. As long as we use deterministic algorithms and pseudo randomness, there will not be a true AI either.

[23:26](#msg5b04a71b752aff5931088467)@9214 Exactly. That's why the term AI is used inflationary and misleading.

dander

[23:46](#msg5b04abde556e4c40fb625e84)@BeardPower how can you be sure that "true AI" is non-deterministic? I know it starts to get into the question about whether we have free will or not, but I don't see any definitive way to answer that.

BeardPower

[00:19](#msg5b04b3a997a0361fb757a84e)@dander Because a human being is not and AI is aiming to resemble human intelligence: I think, therefore I am.

[00:21](#msg5b04b3f2556e4c40fb627293)Yes, I'm referring to the topic of your link: I think, therefore I am. This would be the basis of an AI. It would be aware of itself.

[00:23](#msg5b04b485752aff593108a7d7)A true AI would be non-deterministic, because it is able to decide for itself. Hey machine, would you be so kind to calculate this for me? The machine will decide for itself! This decision is not deterministic. Maybe it will calculate it for you or not. You will not know.

[00:23](#msg5b04b49697a0361fb757aa47)That's why I'm sure ;-)

[00:25](#msg5b04b50fd88b24150d2932d3)Yeah, the issue with the free will... At least the machine can prove, as any human can, if it exists.

[00:28](#msg5b04b5a097a0361fb757ad0f)The other stuff can neither be proved nor disproved and we wander along the philosophical path of "is anything real beyond ourself".

gltewalt

[01:52](#msg5b04c95960209a1187d76339)You’ll not be able to tell if a machine decided or “felt like” doing something

dander

[07:09](#msg5b05139a3815f70bffcf8039)@BeardPower I'm not convinced that an intelligent machine, or a human for that matter, is not deterministic. There is no way to test it for a human at least, because you can never recreate the exact same inputs. You certainly could with a machine. In your scenario where you ask it to perform a calculation, maybe it will or won't... You might not know what it will do because each time you ask, time has passed and it has more history to consider, etc. It doesn't really require randomness. Maybe it's an unimportant distinction.

[07:09](#msg5b0513beaaafa25932aba71f)That being said, I do agree with you that current AI doesn't seem to resemble anything intelligent. It seems like it's basically an optimized system for pattern recognition/manipulation.

hiiamboris

[07:11](#msg5b0514096309af743d08202f)I can speak for myself: I do not really "decide" anything but follow a set of simple algorithms that even I myself am able to foresee most of the time. The fact that other human beings are in no position to command me what to do does not make me non-deterministic. It just makes me nearly impossible to predict using current hardware base.

dander

[07:12](#msg5b051447d96cfd743eb38dca)You could look at our brains as a collection of interconnected systems, with pattern recognition being one. Maybe this is just the first piece of the puzzle, and AIs just need more of those systems in order to become more capable

BeardPower

[09:19](#msg5b05321a5f3e6b40fada9f4c)@gltewalt Exactly.

[09:26](#msg5b0533d82942532e42d59470)@dander Time is another input, yes, but as @gltewalt pointed out, you don't know if the AI was not in a mood to answer (correctly) or it was not able to. This is not deterministic. It would be deterministic, if the AI isn't able to feel or decide on it's own. Even if the inputs are the same all the time, the AI can decide what he wants to do: not deterministic.

[09:27](#msg5b053417fb0f4a0bfe63528f)@hiiamboris If it's nearly impossible to predict, it's random, which means it's not deterministic.

[09:28](#msg5b053455fb0f4a0bfe6352f4)An outcome with a certain probability is not deterministic.

nedzadarek

[11:09](#msg5b054bf4ee623e2e41f84df9)@BeardPower About randomness: we might be as well chaotic at least in the micro-scale. I mean, there are \*\*lot of \** atoms (and many more smaller things) that do chaotic stuffs but you still go to the kitchen to make a tea.

BeardPower

[11:26](#msg5b054fd1b435f21fb8be8e4e)@nedzadarek Yes, but the way you go into the kitchen and make a tea is random. Your movement, timing etc. is always different. Nature is true randomness.

&gt; domain specific languages as another angle on correctness

Yes, it helps but you should do the same things as in \*normal code\*. The Red's parse helps you but you are still able to introduce "hard to catch bugs". I read that Racket does it better but I have to try it.

nedzadarek

[11:30](#msg5b0e8b69361a950a6628b83f)@guraaku as 9214 said, you don't have to use `parse`. Here is simple DSL using function + block:

```
foo: func [name block /local ind][
    print ["user: " name]
    ind: 0 
    foreach w block [
        prin ind prin ": " 
        print w
        ind: ind + 1
    ]
]

foo "baz" [
    abc
    def
    ghi
]
; user:  baz
; 0: abc
; 1: def
; 2: ghi
```

So, yeah, no need for parse in some cases.

Yes, but that's not a spec.

guraaku

[11:48](#msg5b0e8f9e99fa7f4c062eab99)so instead of writing their requirements in English, they write their requirements in the DSL. They then press a button and get a working system which implements what they specified in the DSL

[12:12](#msg5b0e953a352b9e1a4b44b5aa)If you want it to do, you need to tell it to!

[12:13](#msg5b0e9574016ae21a4cf68caa)You can tell the machine to do it separately or all together.

[12:14](#msg5b0e9597a45f930a65e84116)If the compiler was not optimized for it, the machine will not do it for you, you have to tell it to do it.

nedzadarek

[12:16](#msg5b0e962ba45f930a65e84449)@BeardPower no, no, no!  
I don't specify anywhere how to `add` something. I just said this should be \*something\*.  
`foreach` is just for convenience - I can just do it manually.  
In the end I just tell the picat (in the example) what I want - not how to do it. Everything is solved by the Sat.

BeardPower

[12:16](#msg5b0e962eba1a351a68d6bfbd)The whole thing about algorithms is telling the machine how to do stuff.  
What: find the shortest path from A to B (what the machine should do -&gt; a spec)  
How: implement the shortest path search (how the machine should do it -&gt; an algorithm)

An algorithm is the implementation of the spec.

[20:12](#msg5b159d21016ae21a4c0d086a)Microsoft certainly earned themselves a nasty reputation, but in recent years have really changed their stance on open source. I don't know if it's necessary to run for the hills just yet...

BeardPower

[20:14](#msg5b159dc052e35117cd09343f)They changed their stance in some stuff, but even got worse on other: UWP is just one example. They want to cash in the same way as Apple does. Locking in vendors and developers. .Net core was a nice incentive but it lacks graphics/UI, which Microsoft is not interested in. They are more interested in web stuff, that's why they also bout Xamarin.

[20:15](#msg5b159df235e25f39974b6226)They recently bought Gamesparks as well to get into data-mining of mobile games.

[20:16](#msg5b159e1599fa7f4c06451430)Amazon bought PlayFab. The good stuff is in control of the big boys, again.

[20:17](#msg5b159e44a45f930a65fedf4d)It happened with a lot of great services, only to shut it down after some time.

[20:17](#msg5b159e6e52e35117cd09367b)They still want to control the PC, as they always tried.

[20:19](#msg5b159edcf9f2e56cf23e56f9)Don't be evil... yeah, just works nicely on paper.

dander

[20:19](#msg5b159ee3a45f930a65fee12a)Yeah, it does really suck to see a good service languish and die after being scooped up

[20:21](#msg5b159f4393dc78791caf2e37)This seems like a strategic acquire to me though. I bet they are finding it really hard to get adoption on VSTS, and maybe they think they can get more people using Azure services this way. I suppose it all depends on \_how_ they end up pushing that.

BeardPower

[20:22](#msg5b159fa099fa7f4c06451afe)There are a lot of stories how they want to cash in. There was some Indy developer, who wanted to release a patch on the Xbox. To release that patch would have cost him 10k USD! They waved the fee after there was some shit-storm brewing up about it.

[20:23](#msg5b159fcab6eece791ddbe4dc)Of course it's a strategic acquire. They can now poach in the best projects ;-)

dander

[20:29](#msg5b15a13535e25f39974b717c)If I understand, MS also was doing some sort of internal validation testing on the patches, so it would cost them a non trivial amount of money to patch a game, even if it was an indy. So there is some rationale to them charging for that. Under that model at least. I don't know if it's still that way though.

They had the software, the people, the support all in place. As I asked them, why they drop the superior version, they just replied like that:

\- What is the use case for functions as contexts?

well, it's ez:  
\- it makes sense to call composite from inside of a function to inline words bound to it (otherwise it uses global ones)  
\- same as before, consider an example:

```
f: func [w][

[02:05](#msg5b207c07fd5b835b2d56e53a)\*raises hand timidly* .. What’s the normal use case for string interpolation? AFAIK, Redbol has never had it.

greggirwin

[02:09](#msg5b207cc4e87f0c7bee86c34b)R2 had `build-markup`, but not a more general solution. `Reword` was added to R3 for this purpose.

There's no "normal" use case, as it's widely applicable. It puts the emphasis on the string content, which is generally the bulk of the template, rather than the expressions being evaluated.

[02:10](#msg5b207d3286343c3a32ffdba8)The old classic example is a mail merge feature in word processors.

[02:11](#msg5b207d6ba0161836cb165bdc)It's also handy for template based code generation.

[02:13](#msg5b207dad8864a936cc839273)It's not always shorter, but by being a declarative approach, it still has benefits.

gltewalt

[02:39](#msg5b2083d7202c8f71f5fd1459)I thought the redbol way was `[“My name is” name]`. Kind of like the mirror image of string interpolation, or bizarro interpolation, because they aren’t string-centric languages

greggirwin

[06:02](#msg5b20b380fd5b835b2d574319)That is the Redbol way, but it sometimes isn't as convenient when you want to control formatting, or gives users the ability to create template files. Interpolation (though you don't call it that with end users) is easy to understand.

hiiamboris

[09:04](#msg5b20de13e87f0c7bee878783)@gltewalt yeah man I was too unsure if it even makes sense to interpolate strings, but then I found out it wins in readability considerably:

[16:39](#msg5b2148dbd128fa71f666e45f)There will never be a perfect choice for markers, so the goal is to find what has the most meaning in Red, and the quietest syntax, along with low chance of conflict with regular punctuation. If you have suggestions for better default markers, make your case on those points.

The `:( …​ ):` markers already have meaning in Red. Colons are used to get and set values, and parens indicate evaluation. 2 chars on each end, in this combination, shouldn't appear often in human text, or in Red data (I didn't say \*never\*, just not often).

[01:39](#msg5b21c74c4fbf4449eb14c610)I'll try to get the updated version out tomorrow, either on the gist, or the formatting repo.

I did consider allowing a single value for `markers`, and have done that in the past. Still not sold on it, as it opens other questions. e.g., then why require a block for them at all, as @nedzadarek notes. If this were a function that saw as much use as `[if either foreach func ...]`, shortcuts have more value.

I encourage people to play with alternatives, but my instinct says we'll just be making different tradeoffs, not clear improvements. We can craft confusing examples for anything. If you go back to my 3 criteria, make suggestions and a case for each of those points.

ps. you welcome

[13:35](#msg5b42130d60c38707836787b8)@abdllhygt When I'm looking for some more advanced things (about English) I check websites about learning English or some dictionary-like sites that give you translation, alternatives and examples.

[13:42](#msg5b4214de33b0282df409e91e)I think it's little off topic to `/help` and `/parse` so I'll put it here.  
I've been thinking about regular expressions, `parse`, the Perl 5, the Perl 6 and stuffs.  
I read that `parse` should be "more powerful" than other mainstream RegExp engines ("if you need to parse html don't use RegExp"). The RegExp, a regular grammars are level 3 of chomsky hierarchy. `parse` is from Top-down parsers - they are from Context-free grammars (2nd level). Are there things that you wish you had mainstream Regular Expressions in the Red/Rebol? Are something easier using Regular expressions than `parse`?

What about the Perl 5's and the Perl 6's Regular Expressions "systems" (I don't know proper name)? I read that Perl's RegExps are more powerful than mainstream RegExps. Some softwares have "the Perl-based/influenced RegExp". What's the difference between the Perl 5's Regular Expressions system and the `parse`?  
The \[Perl 6](https://perl6.org/) has  
&gt; Definable grammars for pattern matching and generalized string processing

```
grammar Parser {
    rule  TOP  { I <love> <lang> }
    token love { '♥' | love }
    token lang { < Perl Rust Go Python Ruby > }
}

say Parser.parse: 'I ♥ Perl';
# OUTPUT: ｢I ♥ Perl｣ love => ｢♥｣ lang => ｢Perl｣

say Parser.parse: 'I love Rust';
# OUTPUT: ｢I love Rust｣ love => ｢love｣ lang => ｢Rust｣
```

It looks like it's close to `parse`. Again, what's the difference between the Perl 6's Regular Expression "system" and `parse`? Is one more powerful/faster than other?

Your (especially the Perl 5/6 users) thoughts on this topic are welcome!

```

## Tuesday 10th July, 2018

Oldes

[09:47](#msg5b4480b93572e970c184f092)@iArnold your fork was a nonsense.

pekr

[12:13](#msg5b44a2e4bd92d80782a33586)I would not go so far, as calling something being a nonsense. I think that knowing iArnold a bit, his motive is as is the motive of us all - seeing a faster progress of the language ecosystem we would all like to use on a daily basis. The thing is, that iArnold is silent most of the time, then jumps in with a remarks, which sound negatively in the end. The problem with an official or a separate distro, has several dimensions - not everyone's code could be accepted as a contribution, mostly because of the code quality reasons. But also because Red team might have completly different idea, of the form of future project additions, eg. IO.

[12:15](#msg5b44a3517e23133ecb40ffad)I do remember how picky RT was to accept someone's code, unless it was of a good enough quality. FS would have to produce specs for certain features, which could be delivered to the third party, but even then I think , that that's not how such stuff is developed. I think that you first need to prototype it, which means, writing it yourself or under the strict supervision of the team.

[12:17](#msg5b44a3def16644066128ba95)We are imo free to implement add-on elements (libraries), which don't interfere with the official distro architecture. Having separate fork is a nature of the open source world. Maybe that is what iArnold had originally in mind - the distro for ppl to prototype, share some implementation ideas, etc. But maybe it was felt as being unnecessary, contraproductive, I just don't know.

rebolek

[12:34](#msg5b44a7e4e534eb69a5d7783a)Sorry, but I still think that \[this "freered" fork](https://github.com/freered/red) is a nonsense if there is no leader.

greggirwin

[18:01](#msg5b44f47881816669a4409707)There are a lot of ways to contribute. Once we get modules, it will be much easier for people to create pieces that others can try out, without having to be part of the main repo. I do a lot of experiments outside the main repo, because that's easier for me. It also keeps you from messing with things outside their scope, or explicitly patching things in Red, which is also not a bad thing, as it can make clear what your intent is, in the context of what you're writing.

Managing FOSS projects is hard, and there's no single right way to go about it. Forks are fine, for people to experiment with ideas. If someone wants to contribute to Red, it's best to communicate the goals and changes. In the case of bug fixes, the problem or change is identified first. In the case of wishes or changes that aren't agreed-upon as bugs, some chat should naturally occur to nail down the target.

[18:13](#msg5b44f73160c38707836e01cf)&gt; And iArnold does not try to implement own wishes.. he just merges from time to time.. https://github.com/freered/red/commits?author=iArnold

Well it has been put in ice after the warm welcome it received, but back then I did keep the fork up to date longer period of time. It could be done again, but only by demand I would put some effort in. And having no leader, that was part of the idea, accepting code that was maybe not up to standard for the real team, but good enough to work on and improve for others. Not relying on the repo of one person in particular, a person that can and will(?) disappear.  
@greggirwin I tried to remind the people here that soon the last release will be one year ago, so I package this in the birthday party remark. A little bit of critical thoughts but trying to emphasize reality of things. Not intentional negative.

greggirwin

[18:20](#msg5b44f8d4bd92d80782a42bd9)Unfortunately, it did come across as negative, at least to me. Thanks for clarifying. When you're working as hard as we are, and the way the world works now, we try not to be too sensitive, but negative press can hurt a project badly, so we sometimes need to respond.

The "reality of things" is that there have been a lot of stable builds since then, and automated builds continually improving things. Quite a lot has happened, especially since January. As with all FOSS projects, they move as fast as contributors make them. We're building things in alignment with where the support comes from.

But you still have to know internals, right? Or will you modularize main code as well?

greggirwin

[22:16](#msg5b45305b3d8f71623d6d57e9)Knowing and using internals is different than potentially changing them. That is, code that becomes part of the Red core needs to be held to a higher standard, both design and code quality.

nedzadarek

[22:30](#msg5b45338ce534eb69a5d91a50)@greggirwin yes, it needs to be "better". I mean, for example I, can write Red-level modules (using `do` + some files) but I haven't changed the repository nor I haven't written Red/System-level modules. The internals are too complex for me at the moment. Will new module system help people like me to write such modules?

greggirwin

[22:33](#msg5b453422a99e1e52b72707bb)The idea is not that it would be easier to learn internals, but that you could write your own, much like people do with NPM for JS.

pekr

[10:27](#msg5b472cfa73026160f59929ac)Red/System in itself, is kind of a VM, no? Red compiles down to R/S, which compiles down to target. One of the targets might be another VM, e.g. Web Assembly was mentioned ....

nedzadarek

[10:48](#msg5b4731f073026160f5993a31)@pekr indeed, R/S provides some basic types. In the future there will be Gargbage collector. Thank you for this \*perspective\*.

9214

[11:37](#msg5b473d8173026160f5995bca)@nedzadarek @pekr Red/System is not a virtual machine, Red's runtime (written in R/S) is.

[11:38](#msg5b473dc59a612333aa596e35)In some sense, "virtual machine" is just a fancy name for "interpreter", i.e. anything that interprets input and performs actions according to some instruction set.

[11:44](#msg5b473f23d1428e5aefe0b3ce)@nedzadarek "self-hosted" means that all parts of Red will be rewritten either in Red/System or in Red itself, dropping Rebol2 dependency entirely. Currently, Red/System runtime and Red compiler with lexer are written in Rebol.

[13:12](#msg5b4753ba95e03e3d7b4378e0)@pekr No, Red/System is not a VM. It's using an execution stack, but not it's own byte-code or intermediary language.

[13:13](#msg5b4753f29a612333aa59b79d)R/S compiles down to Red, because R/S is a dialect of Red.

[13:15](#msg5b47545fbd14e65d2f61d66f)Red does not compile down to a target, it's emitting the target's machine code directly. There is no assembler involved.

[13:16](#msg5b4754b7897d514b3c473ab1)Well, granted, this can be called "compiled down to a target".

[13:19](#msg5b47555e95e03e3d7b437efc)

```
Red/System is a dialect (DSL) of the Red programming language. Its purpose is to provide:

    -low-level system programming capabilities
    -a tool to build Red's runtime low-level library
    -a tool to link code and produce executables

Red/System can be seen as a C-level language with memory pointer support and a very basic and limited set of datatypes.

Implementation note: It is currently provided with a complete tool-chain generating executables from source files. This is a temporary state as Red/System will live inside Red, so will be embedded in Red scripts.
```

It's awesome, but their implementation has a few issues, their IDE is using Electron and requires using Wine when not on Windows, they export to Unity and the web but the web version is trailing behind the Unity version and Unity does of course add lots of complexity, so a tiny cross platform Red version that would eventually also run on Android and the web could be very popular I think and it makes for a nice PARSE example since Ink is a very simple text format similar to something like Markdown.

[22:09](#msg5b47d19f73026160f59b47ae)Also great for teaching, with something very concrete to "play" and learn from, not just for kids, but there too. Different than dumbing things down, but offering levels of construction kits. Ah, so fun to think about!

cryptowyrm

[22:21](#msg5b47d469b5efcd5aeef74457)Thanks :) Yeah I try to make the code very readable. "Good code" is highly subjective, for me it's readability first, idiomatic use of the language second and then speed. I probably fail on the second part in some areas because I'm just not a Red expert yet, but maybe that's also a good thing since it also means it's easier for beginners to understand. I think Carl was very focused on readability as well. When you go through his old blog posts, he talked about carefully considered every variable and function name. Not too short, not too long. It's the reason I never liked C/C++. Not because of the language, but how it's typically used. Too cryptic. It can be beautiful, you see that in BeOS/Haiku, but typically it's ugly (to me, again, subjective). Objective-C goes in the other direction, superLongMethodName:with:many:attributes. Rebol/Red is a bit in-between, which I like.

[22:22](#msg5b47d4c3897d514b3c48e856)It's funny, for me some of Carl's code is the hardest to understand, because it's so dense, and very idiomatic. You really have to tease it apart, which is sometimes a sign of good Redbol code; highly distilled.

[22:24](#msg5b47d517897d514b3c48e9ae)You need to match three gems or more of the same color either vertically or horizontally in a line. You can swap a gem with another right next to it, horizontally or vertically, by clicking on the first gem and then the gem you want to swap it with (the game also shows you visually which gems you can click on when you selected the first.) That's how most match 3 games work, some also allow you to swap gems anywhere on a line horizontally or vertically, not just right next to each other, but I find that makes it too easy :)

cryptowyrm

[22:31](#msg5b47d6da866e0c6b15a21cf3)Yeah. And you get more points when there are more than three in a line. I think it's 5 points for each gem when there is 3 gems in a row. 10 for 4, 20 for 5 or more, so it's best to try and match as much gems in a row as possible. Some games create powerups when you do that, for example a bomb which will clear a 3x3 field of gems. There are even match 3 role playing games, where you fight enemies by matching gems. You've got spells which are executed once you've matched a certain number of gems of a specific color and so on. For some reason match 3 has become super popular these past few years, there are literally thousands of games now in that genre :)

[22:52](#msg5b47dbc0c02eb83d7c6e2c05)Thanks! Probably not the code I added today though, haven't had time to refactor that yet :) All those new global variables. I'm mostly writing ClojureScript with Reagent these days, where you have all of the app state in one huge map. I'm thinking about experimenting with that and Red, because I do like the general concept of that. To make it easier to work with a single big data structure, you have the concept of cursors, which basically create a reference to a specific sub section in the big map so it can be used without having to write/very/long/paths when modifying variables.

[11:45](#msg5b4890d6c2d95c60f4d6a53b)Per game experience, my first feature request would be to have it let me make moves while it's still animating falling pieces (otherwise I'm often stuck waiting for it).

[11:50](#msg5b489201897d514b3c4ac157)And theoretically there can be such gems layout that there will be no valid move at all, right? Like a checkered board of 4 colors or smth. Does this ever happen in practice or it's so improbable that isn't even worth checking?

[11:57](#msg5b4893c173026160f59d2fa4)@cryptowyrm very interesting \[article](https://steemit.com/programming/@crypticwyrm/every-programmer-should-check-out-smalltalk-80-at-some-point-in-their-life-tutorial-inside).  
2 things that are not explained:  
\- why you need put instance variable inside quotes (`'foo'`) but "temporary variables" doesn't need it (`|c|`)  
\- where you haven't implemented one method - you could explain that code more or less (`counter(object) doesn't understand decrement` is not hard to understand thought)

Aside this, it's very good article.

[14:27](#msg5b48b6ce66c1e833a9e52177)I'm currently getting into Ada again. Red definitely needs some features of Ada: sub-types, ranges, integer wrap-around etc.

cryptowyrm

[14:41](#msg5b48ba1d95e03e3d7b4769c4)@nedzadarek You're right, I could set falling? to falling directly without converting it to a boolean with either.

@hiiamboris I just added the FPS display so I can optimize the code a bit to get to the desired 60 FPS, I get about 38 FPS right now (don't have a dedicated GPU in this computer, broke a few weeks ago). I also wanted to check how much faster the game is on Linux, the last time I tried it it felt at least twice as fast even on an old, $200 netbook. Looks like some changes I made recently stopped the game from working on Linux though so I couldn't check with the new FPS counter.

Moving gems while they are falling I've explicitly disabled. It'st just an `unless falling?` somewhere, so easy to remove. But you're supposed to wait, since a match you wanted to make might not be possible anymore once all blocks have fallen and chain reactions destroyed other blocks. So being able to move them while they are falling could be considered a bit of a cheat. But I think some match 3 games do allow it, so it could be considered a matter of taste.

It's theoretically possible that there is no valid move left, but in the current configuration (8x8 board with 5 different color gems) it basically never happens. With 6 colors it happens a lot. So yeah it's something I have to check for and then reset the board, since I do want to make the game board configurable in the UI. You can already do it in the code, all of the parameters in the "Game parameters" section can be edited. So you can make a 10 by 5 board or something like that. You can also change the GEM-SIZE which is important once I've built in window resizing (which is easy to do, just haven't gotten around to it yet), then GEM-SIZE is going to be set automatically based on the window size.

[14:51](#msg5b48bc79d1428e5aefe5085b)@nedzadarek Single quotes are used for strings in Smalltalk. So you have to put them around instance variables in the class definition because it's basically just a string of words that Smalltalk splits up based on whitespace and then turns into variable names. So it's not that instance variables are in general written in quotes, it's that the method that creates classes takes a string as input instead of a list of words. For some reason. No idea why :)

[15:00](#msg5b48be8ab5efcd5aeef9c2e2)Pharo is based on Squeak. And Squeak is based on the Smalltalk Apple developed and then sold to Disney. Squeak is more of a learning enviroment, whereas Pharo is meant for real projects, it removed a lot of the teach kids programming stuff for example.

[21:53](#msg5b491f51c02eb83d7c71a9fb)@hiiamboris Since it happens so rarely (I've only seen it once so far), my theory is that it happens when you swap gems while the process-gems loop is in a very specific position right now. So instead of swapping gems in the on-up mouse event handler (which was a silly idea to begin with), I've now changed the code to just set origin and target gem positions in the event handler and do the actual swapping in the process-gems loop, when both origin and target is set. That way I can control exactly when in the loop gems should be swapped. Should make it much more robust. https://github.com/cryptowyrm/red-scripts/commit/8720e924ab39564a1ae0fee16e38dae15966e898

[22:31](#msg5b492853641ecc065fa12905)Yeah they added lots of stuff, they forked Squeak a long time ago so Pharo is quite different now. If it's better or not is probably open for debate, and depends on what you want to do, but I think so, I'd always recommend Pharo. Also worth looking at if you're only interested in Windows apps is Dolphin Smalltalk, it's been open sourced a while ago. Windows only, but you can create native Windows GUIs with it which you can't do with Pharo, with Pharo it's their own cross platform GUI that doesn't look native.

Now you start with 90 seconds on the timer and get 1 bonus second for matching 4 gems, 2 for 5 and 3 for 6 or more. In my tests I managed to get 90 bonus seconds so 180 in total as it was before, which is a good length for one session I think. I tried to make it more difficult over time, there is a new timer now which counts the total elapsed time, but I haven't come up with a good solution there yet, need to come up with some fancy math.

If anyone has the link or name, please tell me :)

[11:49](#msg5b49e32d66c1e833a9e7c38a)@cryptowyrm about game:  
Yes, it's job for game developer. It depends if you want to make casual or hardcore game. I would draw some graphs to see the numbers. MS. Excel (or Open source equivalements) is helpful.  
About commits:  
It's interesting that my commit looks like it has been pushed by 2 people (2 icons).  
Smalltalk:  
GUI/apps might look little different but it should works and be easy to do. With the Rebol I had 1 exe so I could write batch files to run my applications. With the Red I can compile it.  
I've tried smalltalk (the Squeak probably) and solution was not so easy (make user install smalltalk + give them image). I've seen some "packers" like Iceberg but I've not tested them.  
Dolphin Smalltalk has "deploy" feature so I think it should be like the Red (I haven't tested it).

cryptowyrm

[12:10](#msg5b49e8531c0f906b14523701)@nedzadarek Yes, with the merge commit style it would have shown two commits, your original commit and then one by me which says your commit was merged. The rebase commit style makes just one commit but shows it as having an author (you) and a commiter (me).

As for deploying Smalltalk apps, on Mac it's easy since a .app "file" is just a folder the OS treats like a file. So you can put everything your app needs in that folder, including the .image and the .changes file. The actual executable can just be a shell script. On Windows you would need to use an installer or if you want something simple, a self-extracting exe (WinRar can create them for example) which would zip the VM, the image, the changes file and a shell script that runs the app. Then when you click the .exe, everything is extracted into a temporary location and then executes the shell script, every time the .exe is run. So that is less efficient, but since Smalltalk apps start instantly anyhow thanks to the image file, it shouldn't matter much.

nedzadarek

[12:29](#msg5b49ecad1c0f906b14523f61)@cryptowyrm but you have to do this for each major platforms (linux, macos and windows). In case of the Red - you can just compile for all 3 major platforms.  
Another consideration is a size. The squeak 5 has 125 MB, the newest Dolphin ~23. Your game + red executable -&gt; 1-2 MB.

cryptowyrm

[12:53](#msg5b49f245866e0c6b15a72661)You can use a smaller image for distribution which only has what your app needs, removing all of the development tools. Factor uses images too and I believe the .EXEs it creates are below 1 Mb (been a long time since I played around with it). But yeah, I wouldn't recommend using Smalltalk to write real apps, I've never done it. My favorite languages for that right now are Red for desktop, ClojureScript for web, Clojure for server side web stuff, but you can do everything client side today so I haven't written server side code in years. Smalltalk to me is purely interesting as a learning environment and from a historical perspective. When you want to really know what OOP is, and not how other languages misinterpreted it, you have to look at Smalltalk.

nedzadarek

[13:57](#msg5b4a013cb5efcd5aeefc83db)@cryptowyrm  
I haven't used the Factor for long time but I remember the exe it had produced was huge (simple hello-world-like application).  
I deployed "better hello world". Tons of checkboxes but the resulting files have ~12MB. Not bad.  
Well, at the moment I'm writing (or want to write) smaller gui applications. The red seems to be good for small applications but for bigger... I don't know. The Dolphin seems overcomplicated for simple `better hello world`.

[16:37](#msg5b4a26d026aa91065e941488)Well the issue with Red is that it isn't done yet. I don't think there is a problem writing a big app in Red other than that. Until then, personally I would probably use Racket. It creates native GUIs for Mac, Win and Linux and it's scheme lisp so very simple and it comes with extensive documentation. Rebol was initially based on scheme lisp from what I read but moved further and further away from it over time, so using Racket would have at least some tiny similarity to using Red. You don't have VID of course, I've never seen anything as simple as VID. Ruby's Shoes comes the closest I would say. Although with Shoes I don't think you could easily write bigger applications, that is more suited for small apps.

[17:02](#msg5b4a2cb09a612333aa60ecaf)I barely remember anything about Delphi and Pascal, we learned those two in school, but I remember that I quite liked it. I also used RealBasic for a while, which is basically Visual Basic but creates GUIs for Mac, Win and Linux. I don't think it exists anymore. Lots of programmers look down on these GUI builder programming tools (just like they look down on web developers), but you can make highly sucessful apps with it for sure, I did. I have to say though, using something like GTK or Qt, especially when using a high level language like Python or Ruby, isn't hard. It's just complex, you have to write lots and lots of code. Apple's Swing even makes native macOS programming fairly easy, but still utterly complex. I think that's what Rebol/Red solve the most. The complexity. You only add as much complexity as you need (you can always drop down from VID to VIEW for more advanced stuff), but you start with something as simple as it can possibly be. With nearly everything else, you start complex and stay complex.

[18:31](#msg5b4a419373026160f5a10051)All these languages do not solve the problems for my domain: security and reliability. Ada, Rust and Pony offer what I need: no deadlooks, no buffer overflows, no segfaults but still being a compiled language with high performance. If the program compiles, it's crash-free. This is something needed for mission-critical applications, where failures cost lives or big financial risks. I don't know, if Red can offer all this in the future, but it would be more than awesome to stick with one language for everything, instead of writing the core with language X and interfacing with Red through a FFI.

&gt; It's like automatic modulo. If you specify a range of 0..255 and you set a variable to 257 it revolves to 2.

Isn't it a bad thing? I mean do you really want 255 + 1 to be silently set to 1? I don't think everyone want this. If you don't set some kind of checks your code can work showing incorrect output.

About languages:  
Sure, they are not very secure. Although I think Racket might be worth checking... but It might have runtime-checks.  
btw. I've seen some smalltalk on medic device but I cannot find it.

@cryptowyrm Yes, the Red is in alpha. Console applications might be easier but GUI programming might be worse. I haven't built any \*big* application but I have seen people solving problems with gui by either `compose`ing or building your own faces.  
The Racket might be very good... but I hate 2 things in programming:  
\- parenthesis overload  
\- very explicit definition style of Java

There is the \[Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/). It may not be alive like other languages but It influenced other like Ada.

Gui builders - sometimes you just want to simple stuffs like few buttons, one "canvas" that get your mouse position/button presses etc.  
When Red will have user defined styles (more complex than `view [style blue-base: base red blue-base "Red"]`) then it will be less complex.

greggirwin

[14:14](#msg5b4b56ac866e0c6b15ab2aec)&gt; The advantage with those languages is, that they provide guarantees without providing less.

@BeardPower they provide less options (i.e., more constraints) in how you can express things, correct? And in what you have to specify to make the compiler happy, so it \*can* verify things.

If we want to write a secure OS, the first thing to do is create the languages we need to build it. :^)

cryptowyrm

[15:48](#msg5b4b6cc36534bc5d2e5e27dc)@nedzadarek I'm not sure if it exists for Racket yet, but for Clojure there is now parinfer, which treats the code as if it's whitespace was part of the syntax like in Python, and the parenthesis are then automatically added based on whitespace, based on how you format your code. Makes editing Lisp code super easy, you just indent and code is moved into or out of parenthesis, and you can basically ignore the parenthesis completely at that point, some editors even show them in a barely visible color since you just don't need to think about them anymore. There are still some issues with parinfer that need to be solved, but it already works really well, I'm using it all the time.

BeardPower

[15:52](#msg5b4b6da59a612333aa641bd0)@greggirwin well, they are very expressive but sure, you are more limited on how you can do it, but not what you can do. The compiler can verify things, because you need to follow a specific programming model.

[15:53](#msg5b4b6dfe582aaa63076d3fac)A secure OS not only needs a language but also the implementation/models need to be secure.

Of course, everyone has limited knowledge.  
Maybe the trees are not even green or the sun is not even yellow, we just have the impression they are.  
Without the knowledge needed to disprove it, there is no chance to disprove it. So it's a sound prove based on the current knowledge, right.

[17:26](#msg5b4cd5559a612333aa682469)&gt; Some years ago people thought the Earth was flat. Then Christopher Columbus came.

Very much b.s. and you know better than that. The Greeks already knew it must be a sphere and calculated the earth's size. Then religion came and flattened the earth again on penalty of death for those claiming the opposite. But the earth is indeed flat, but only seen very locally. and there is no up and down for a map, north up and south down, that is only convention.

dander

[18:43](#msg5b4ce74095e03e3d7b578a77)@hiiamboris It's a little tricky to prove to yourself that the earth is round without trusting any outside source, but even there, you can \_see_ the curvature from a tall mountain, or from an aircraft. If you don't trust that, it's possible to calculate the diameter of the earth by looking at the length of shadows from different latitudes. Flat earth also requires a massive global conspiracy involving coordination of all governments + sciences. If you assume that the earth is flat, you run into all kinds of problems trying to come up with an alternate feasible model. It's kind of unbelievable to me that the flat-earther movement is a thing, but I guess it's more about rejection of authority + conspiracy thinking rather than skepticism.

Actually Earth can be hollow and we can be living inside, it can be just strange geometry of space that we interpret in wrong way. You can't disprove it. But it's easier to interpret data in a "standard" way. And also, interpreting data in the way that Earth is flat is much more complicated than the hollow model.

Do none of them exhibit curiosity or at least simulate it? There are many governments and private corporations that have launched satellites. Do you think it's possible that they could have done so successfully completely by accident, and then after that, just never noticed that the prevailing model of Earth was wrong?

[17:59](#msg5b4e2e6bcad358639d5fe52c)@hiiamboris No, you are correct, but the Atomontage Engine is a Voxel engine, so you have voxel cone tracing baked in, so to speak.

[17:59](#msg5b4e2e9ead8d085553a9c48e)No need to have a polygonal scene in addition to the voxels for the lighting.

[18:04](#msg5b4e2fc2f046ba6aca5ed973)VCT is using voxels for GI/Ligthing. Atomontage Engine is using Voxels for everything. It was designed as a physics simulator.

[18:07](#msg5b4e306ecad358639d5feb35)@BeardPower so returning to the former question, how do voxel objects support reflection (like https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Phong\_components\_version\_4.png ) considering their surfaces normals can face only 6 directions?

BeardPower

[18:08](#msg5b4e30b9a94c5255523b4ef8)@hiiamboris By using VCT :-)

[18:10](#msg5b4e310164990f3c000bce7c)VCT is ray-tracing in a Voxel scene. It's using cone shaped rays.

[18:11](#msg5b4e3135fd1b3474a698cedf)You can use any ray-tracing/path-tracing technique on Voxels.

hiiamboris

[18:14](#msg5b4e322179f7236acb31bcd8)so how would it work? will it sort of derive the reflective direction from 6-12 adjacent voxels positions of different \*density* or what?

BeardPower

[18:16](#msg5b4e3267f046ba6aca5ee083)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaBCb7pDK\_U

[18:18](#msg5b4e32dc55a7e23c014b2961)The Voxel will interact with the ray. If it's hit, it will emit light.

[18:19](#msg5b4e331e8fe2780689bddf15)If you have translucent Voxels, the ray would do ray-marching/sub-surface scattering inside the Voxel based on different densities, yes.

hiiamboris

[18:22](#msg5b4e33cdf046ba6aca5ee5c0)So, suppose I have a polished metal orb, or a polished metal orb wet from the rain. If I voxelize it I lose all the surface normal data. How do I calculate lighting then?

[18:23](#msg5b4e341a8fe2780689bde348)I make voxels so small that a few of them will fit into the thin water surface?

[18:24](#msg5b4e34448578203ee73a6556)Then I could detect the margin between air and water, water and metal, and approximately get the surface shape...

BeardPower

[18:24](#msg5b4e34651539a7040ce591b9)It's not any different to a polygonal scene, where light-rays are reflected. The difference is, that you can actually do accurate sub-surface scattering based on the Voxel densities. If you have a non-translucent material, like a metal orb, it would be no different to a polygonal scene.  
The Voxels are, in the best case, 1x1 pixel. You can also specify properties of the Voxel, so it's face is approximated to curves or the normal data of a polygonal shape.

[18:26](#msg5b4e34e203a5fa639e614ee7)Yes, you can specify the properties needed for Snell's law or the behavior of the material.

BeardPower

[18:27](#msg5b4e3525623cc3040b29ccdb)You just need to specify how the internal plane of the Voxel is aligned in 3D space, so you don't reflect on the straight face of the Voxel, but it's internal plane.

[18:41](#msg5b4e3845ad8d085553a9e62a)Are graphics cards still completely useless for voxels? I thought I read some years ago that either there are chips now or they plan to have chips on graphics cards that help with voxels because AAA games have started using voxels to do the calculations for destructible terrain and then paint everything normally using polygons. But maybe I misunderstood, graphics programming is far away from my area of knowledge :)

hiiamboris

[19:06](#msg5b4e3e23ecc1f82e2fbfdc68)@BeardPower how does voxel model propose to handle deformations? like stretching/contracting stuff... with polygons you can just relocate the vertices, but voxels will become sparse if you try to "stretch" them, right?

BeardPower

[19:11](#msg5b4e3f493187ca3ee8bbba17)@cryptowyrm They are not useless, but not optimal. A GPUs is a polygon rasterizer and very fast for working on triangles. As Voxels are not based on triangles, they are not the optimal workload for a GPU. The ray-tracing can be accelerated through the GPU, but this workload is also not optimal. So GPUs are not useless, but not an optimal solution. Yes, there is specialized hardware for ray-tracing and Voxels, which is way faster than any GPU (compare FPGAs and ASICs for crypto-mining to GPUs).

[19:13](#msg5b4e3fbe64990f3c000bfbc5)@hiiamboris Yes, therefore you just insert more Voxels (stretching) or remove some (contracting) and move the Voxels to new positions.

The sound is miserable, but the screencasting software automatically enhances the sound after recording and removes all of the background noises for example, so in the final video it sounded really good to me, relative to not using a professional microphone of course. I have a USB mic lying around somewhere I could try instead, it's also a cheap (25 Euro IIRC) Logitech but back when I bought it people who record audiobooks on librivox said the sound quality of that particular model comes close to that of much higher quality entry level microphones in the $80 to $100 range.

[10:30](#msg5b4f16aead8d085553abfb23)@cryptowyrm Yeah man, becomes barely legible at times ☺. At least on that googledrive video. If I may suggest some ways of improvement of listening quality:  
1\) The mic is really bad. Plus you're speaking relatively quiet. With your low-pitched voice your vocal cords produce a very narrow range of frequencies at quiet volume. Plus the mic distorts it a lot. Plus strong reverb of the room. For voice you don't even need a condenser mic (although some of these are around $50 today), but at least a dynamic one is a must.  
2\) Work on your accent. I understand it's more comfortable to speak as you do, as different languages use different lung and tongue muscles, but I have a feeling you can do better ;)

I'm no screencast sort of guy myself, I don't have patience for those usually. But if I was, it would matter to me what I hear. And then if I like what I hear I might feel sympathetic and listen for a little while more, see what I mean? ;)

cryptowyrm

[10:44](#msg5b4f1a18623cc3040b2be0db)@hiiamboris Sure, feedback is most welcome :) That thick German accent is only going away if I do this more :) The last time I spoke English (aside from a few short screencasts over the years) was in school. But it does seem to get better the faster I talk. That's also a tip I heard from German expats on YouTube. When Germans talk English slowly, they pronounce the words too much, there is no flow, no rhythm to it. In the other screencasts I did for the Learning Red guide, the accent is a lot more bearable I think because I just read the text so I can speak faster. As for the mic, I'll try to find the other one and see if it's any better. It might not be because it's a table microphone and you're supposed to speak up into a microphone not down into it to make it sound better, but we'll see :) If I keep doing the screencasts and they are popular enough I'll probably invest in a better microphone. I don't know what a dynamic mic is but I'll look it up, thanks! But yeah, talking louder is something I should try as well. I have problems talking to a computer, which is why I also don't use Siri &amp; Co. Just feels weird, so that's also something that should get better with time after getting used to it.

@beardpower you're plain wrong ;) try it  
`loop 10000 [wait 1e-3]` in Red, watch the CPU load (`wait` calls Sleep)  
moreover, using a timer implies you should yield your thread time slice to trigger the timer event and that means you can't get the 100% core load (maybe the OS scheduler will mitigate that but it needs testing)

BeardPower

[19:24](#msg5b4f94038fe2780689c1a48b)I'm not talking about a thread sleep. I said that using timers is more efficient than putting a CPU on sleep/thread on sleep.

BeardPower

[19:25](#msg5b4f9442cad358639d63ee60)A CPU and especially a GPU needs to stay hot. Thread switching/task switching is awful.

[19:27](#msg5b4f9491a94c5255523f150a)Putting a thread to sleep could make your program more efficient, it the thread needs to wait. So it depends on the problem.

[19:27](#msg5b4f949afd1b3474a69c99d2)Threads are crappy on Windows. It's using 1MB stack-space per thread. Erlang is only using a few bytes.

hiiamboris

[19:30](#msg5b4f9555ad8d085553adaecb)So what I'm proposing is like this:  
1\) check the event loop and:  
1a) if some timers are expected to be triggered in 0.5ms time - trigger those and schedule their next time  
1b) otherwise call `Sleep(1)` to skip 1ms  
Thus if the load is heavy 1a gets triggered always and you get 100% core load, otherwise up to 0.014% if it's idle

With timers you get a `yield()` regardless if you want it or not, so 100% is unachievable, at least that's how I see it

BeardPower

[19:30](#msg5b4f95644b583a74a727117c)By "does not free the CPU" I meant that it's waisting cycles buy yielding, finding a thread, which is not waiting, house-keeping, context switches. Of course you are correct, that it's not blocking the CPU. Sorry for the bad wording. Monolithic Kernels are crap and they was a lot of cycles if you yield and do context switches. There are better solutions, which don't have this issues. A yield or a "context-switch" takes the cycles of a function call.

[19:36](#msg5b4f96c2ad8d085553adb390)Preemptive vs. Cooperative multithreading are also very different in performance, depending on the architecture. Threads are just a software thing. The CPU does not have a concept of threads. We suffer from the old thing: bloat.

[06:23](#msg5b502e791539a7040ceace73)On PRs, there are 816 closed PRs. We do not ignore them. Some have been there a long time, yes. For those, we could just close them after a time, but we try to have a resolution for them.

It's tough, because we want people to contribute, really we do. But if it's not an easy, clean, clear fix, it can be hard. We understand not everyone will want to ask before doing work, but that can help a lot, so people don't work on something that we're not sure is a fit, which may cause it to sit there for a while.

hiiamboris

[09:02](#msg5b5053bef046ba6aca646e19)@greggirwin great!  
@BeardPower may I ask you :)  
When a timer interrupt happens, how does the control flow go into my callback provided for that timer? Does it work like a stack of CS:IP values, that is appended to every time it gives control to my program when an interrupt happens while it was executing? So if my timer proc takes 2ms and interrupt happens every 1ms will it cause the stack to grow indefinitely?  
Or is it done in some other way? Maybe it won't call the timer if the previous call to it didn't return?

BeardPower

[09:21](#msg5b505811f046ba6aca647969)The Kernel will clear the interrupt. Your ISR should be as fast as possible. If the interrupt is not cleared, you would get stacked interrupts and you would overflow the interrupt stack.

[09:24](#msg5b5058bca94c52555240e3d0)Yes, the OS has it's own interrupt stack, which will give control to your ISR (an ISR is the same as a callback, but on a lower level).

[09:25](#msg5b50591dcad358639d65d241)While your ISR/Callback runs, the interrupt is cleared. When the ISR/Callback returns, it will enable interrupts again. Interrupts from different hardware are not lost, because the interrupt controller will store and manage them.

[09:26](#msg5b50596279f7236acb37502f)The stack would grow indefinitely if you do not clear the interrupt and your ISR will not be called. You would have some infinite loop.

hiiamboris

[09:29](#msg5b505a0fecc1f82e2fc55776)I see... That explains why

```
>> delta-time [i: 100 view [base 100x100 rate 100 on-time [wait 3e-2 if 0 = i: i - 1 [unview]]]]
== 0:00:03.047
```

does not cause any overflow, just takes 3 secs instead of 1

[09:32](#msg5b505a988fe2780689c37cf1)So it's like this then: if I set up timer to tick on every 1ms and my ISR takes 1.1ms, then it will be called every 2ms since on every other tick it's busy and interrupt flag is cleared. And I get 1.1/2.0 = 55% of CPU core loaded. Right?

BeardPower

[09:35](#msg5b505b634b583a74a728edef)Yes.

[22:37](#msg5b5112a3f477e4664aad07b0)@cryptowyrm why use cars/motorcycles when you can ride a bike? It's healthier. Joking aside, swords (or any other traditional-looking melee/white weapons without any sort of energy, magic etc) can be used where you cannot use guns or energy-based weapons, for example in flammable place. What about battery for that ~~light-hearted~~light-saber? You assume that it has huge capacity or can recycle using some weird method.

cryptowyrm

[09:37](#msg5b51ad65f477e4664aae7619)@greggirwin First I need to get Red GUI working again :) I'll have to try running Red through Wine to make the screencasts for now.

Just opened my computer to see what the problem is. Apparently, a little piece broke off the blue CPU socket which holds the cooling block and fan in place over the CPU, so it's completely loose now and CPU might be dead from overheating. I've never seen anything like it, no idea how it broke off suddenly. So for now I'm stuck on the Chromebook. That was the best investment I ever made, €170, it's many years old now (Acer C720) but it just keeps on working. Best emergency notebook ever :) Just wish the European version had as much RAM as the US version, this one has only 2 GB.

[09:39](#msg5b51addef02a0977a3eac8c8)Was Rebol really supposed to turn into a whole OS? I watched a ton of really old Red videos over the last few days that I found on the Software Freedom Day channel. Kaj mentioned that, but that was the first I ever heard of it. I never got into the whole Rebol/IOS stuff though, I guess that was also part of that idea, a networked OS with distributed apps?

[10:37](#msg5b51bb6be06d7e74098f1c6a)@pekr Cool, thanks for the info! I love learning about the history of programming languages I work with. Looks like there is a Lava programming language now, I assume that's not the same though, seems to be a visual programming language: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava\_(programming\_language)  
I heard Carl is even thinking about doing a Rebol 4? Although that might have been an april fools joke. I've started going through the stack overflow Rebol and Red chat to find out a bit more of the development progress over the years, but there is so much text to wade through :)

pekr

[11:10](#msg5b51c31132fa1b740854ea5f)Yes, LAVA is a different language nowadays. Back then, it was some nVidia technology. As for Rebol, it represented an acronym for: LAVA = Language for Audio and Visual Applications, as Carl claimed, that "multimedia is his second name". Sadly, Rebol was never properly accelerated, nor supported smooth animations or advanced audio ....

cryptowyrm

[11:22](#msg5b51c5f7e06d7e74098f3d20)Ah interesting. I guess that's another one of those Amiga influences :) The multimedia machine. Thinking back it was really weird seeing the move from Amiga to IBM PC. The sheleves in stores were full of Amiga games and then every week you could see it shrink down until finally it was a small corner in the store and everything else PC. And the PC wasn't as good as the Amiga. It just wasn't. It felt like taking two steps back. My first PC came with Novell DOS 7, which didn't even work. The guy in the store had so many issues with it he just started giving out pirated copies of MSDOS 6 to replace Novell DOS when customers came with problems.

Yeah audio is something that is still missing from Red as well. Since I do plan to go really deep with Red, I'll have to look into using Red/System and bindings to fill in some of the missing gaps in the meantime. I've stayed very high level in my programming career. I learnt the lower C level stuff in school and took some courses after that but that was a very long time ago so I'll have a lot to learn. But I think it's going to be a lot more fun doing that with Red/System compared to C/C++ :) Although I will read through a C book as well, just to make sure I at least remember the basics.

BeardPower

[12:11](#msg5b51d15ac331e035520774d3)@cryptowyrm More fun in the sense of "easier to code", but the shooting in the foot hurts the same ;-)

cryptowyrm

[12:18](#msg5b51d31fc331e03552077885)@BeardPower True :) But shooting yourself in the foot can be very powerful. You could make the same argument about Rebol/Red and mutable data structures and gradual typing. If we take the extreme at the other end, Elm, it's so hard to shoot yourself in the foot with it that you have to write JavaScript and talk to it through ports to do anything meaningful because Elm itself just can't do it.

[12:22](#msg5b51d3f4f9ffc4664bef170a)Interesting, got Red running in wine now and tried my Match 3 game. I get 60 FPS there, not the capped to 38 FPS due to timers I get on Windows 10. But only if I disable pictures and use draw directly, otherwise I only get 9 FPS :) https://imgur.com/a/dVTFAIh

[17:18](#msg5b521960f02a0977a3ec190a)I remember old time Rebol discussions. Cant find an old article of a former Amiga guy, concluding Windows does not support v-sync, and that being a main problem of animation tearing, etc.

[17:21](#msg5b521a2cee530e4aac885f70)Using old timer methods was usually caused by the broad of Windows systems supported. You surely remember, that Red tried to support XP initially. My understanding is, that for XP, there is going to be mostly a fall back metgod, if at all.

[17:24](#msg5b521aeab2411177a25e1a8a)I am not expert in any of those areas, but I would not wonder, if some recent DirectX APIs would exclude even Windows 7. Otoh I think, that penetration of Windows 7 is still quite high.

cryptowyrm

[17:59](#msg5b5222fa32fa1b74085629db)@hiiamboris Wasn't just the fan, was the whole cooling block, the CPU laid bare with the heating paste on top. And it's probably been like that for a week because the computer kept randomly turning off once or twice per day so the chances are good it suffered some damage. I thought it was just a weird Windows 10 bug related to sleep mode, but now it's likely it was overheating all this time.

[18:02](#msg5b5223ac4b880b3e6a3a75fc)@dander Thanks! :) A friend is giving me his old Compaq laptop tomorrow, has a dead display (that particular model had factory defect where the connection to the display stopped working after 2 years for everyone) but I'm going to hook it up to a monitor with HDMI anyway so hopefully I can continue with the screencast on monday :)

hiiamboris

[18:03](#msg5b5223f0f477e4664aafe9e2)@pekr the multimedia timers API is supported even by W2K so it's no problem. Windows 7 doesn't support vsync in GDI (classic theme, not Aero) mode. W8+ does not have GDI mode anymore. But it's not even the main issue here.

[18:06](#msg5b52249126bfd636be39fd20)@cryptowyrm I had borked my videocard once like that, it started showing random artifacts. But I let it lie cold for a week and it was working fine again. It was long ago though, the tech was different.

cryptowyrm

[18:09](#msg5b522576c579673e6b83bd6f)@hiiamboris Interesting, my video card fried two weeks earlier, so maybe it works again as well. I'll have to see what parts I can salvage from the computer. But it was old anyhow. I'd been using a Mac Mini the past few years but sold it a few months ago since it looks like Apple is going to stop supporting it and used this really old 3 Ghz Phenom X4 PC I had before that instead. They suck way too much power for my taste. I've been playing with the idea of just getting a mini PC like a Raspberry PI (although preferably one with an Intel CPU instead) since I just need the computer to be able to play HD video and write code.

Does anyone know of a way to make the Red plugin in Visual Studio Code work with Red running through wine?

But Red then uses Windows style paths since it's running in Wine, so Red can't find the file /home/chris/Documents/GitHub/red-scripts/match3.red since that path is a Linux path.

[01:24](#msg5b53dcd84b880b3e6a3e1fba)Yeah would be a good idea. I think Red's readme mentions you need a shell script to get Red to work when you put it on your PATH. So it is needed in some situations already.

[01:35](#msg5b53df4c05e1cc35530102dd)Although this would probably be better mentioned in the VSC plugin Wiki and then referenced in the Readme which is shown when you install the plugin, in the Red Wiki no one would ever find it :) But that Wiki can't be edited it seems, probably contributor only.

But I really wish Screencast-o-Matic was still available for Linux, there just isn't anything better. It even allowed me to make small edits while still recording the video. I'm using Kazam right now, seems to still be the best native Linux screencast app, but it always had the problem that it crashes, often, and it doesn't seem like that has improved. It's good enough for now though. I hope we can create a screencasting app with Red at some point :)

greggirwin

[20:51](#msg5b563fdcf9ffc4664bf977e5)@gltewalt, but that's Lisp syntax, not Red. If you disallow infix ops, certainly we can make greedy funcs this way, but why is it \*better* than more meaningful names and a block arg? I can think of very subtle things creeping in that way, and being very hard to debug. OTOH, in dialects, it could be a \*very* powerful approach.

```
; lots of code that sets values
total: deposit my-acct add pay-1 pay-2 pay-3 invoice-1
transfer total dest
```

Now if any of your inputs to `add` should happen to change, producing either an incompatible type for the op, or one that isn't consumed by the macro at all, your behavior changes in a way that may be very hard to see. It takes Red's already powerful free-ranging evaluation model and adds a quantum element to it.

gltewalt

[21:18](#msg5b56463805e1cc355306d898)Ideally I’d like built in functions. The macro way was pointed out to me

greggirwin

[21:33](#msg5b5649a7f9ffc4664bf9965d)`Sum` and `product` will be good standard funcs to have. I agree.

nedzadarek

[22:12](#msg5b5652bae06d7e740999fe93)@hiiamboris or `map` if you don't want to `fold` into one element.

@gltewalt  
&gt; What do you think about having all the op equivalents like add be non-fixed arity?

You would have to define some kind of rules how much arguments does a `function!` takes. In Greg's code: `total: deposit my-acct add pay-1 pay-2 pay-3 invoice-1` do you mean `total: deposit my-acct (add pay-1 pay-2 pay-3) invoice-1` or `total: deposit my-acct (add pay-1 pay-2) pay-3 invoice-1`?

gltewalt

[22:33](#msg5b56579c9ddf5f4aad03d1c5)We already have problems like that. You have to know the words and what arguments are accepted

[22:33](#msg5b5657aaee530e4aac922753)And how many

nedzadarek

[23:11](#msg5b56608d05e1cc3553072312)@gltewalt yes but when you know the words you know which function gets which argument(s).

greggirwin

[01:39](#msg5b568351f10ffa0b48a98fd0)@gltewalt what your proposed change means is no longer having fixed arity for functions at the \*human reasoning* level. That is, you couldn't look at a piece of code, and func specs, and \*know* how many args will be consumed without \*also* knowing the type of every value referenced ahead of time.

I'll ask again, how is this better than `sum [...]` and `product [...]` funcs?

gltewalt

[01:52](#msg5b56865d32fa1b740860456c)If `add` and `multiply` could consume blocks of values, that would be dandy. And we wouldn’t need extra built-ins like sum and product

[01:59](#msg5b5688189ddf5f4aad043842)These are fun things to play with, think through, and learn from. It's the best teacher. It still surprises me how seemingly simple and benign changes are like tugging on a string. Soon you see how many other things start moving.

[11:08](#msg5b59aba06dd1ab57233f5d99)Nearly done with the screencast. What an ordeal! I wiped my Chromebook and installed Arch Linux (Manjaro) because I thought it would be faster than running Ubuntu alongside Chrome OS with Crouton. It actually turns out to be a bit slower, the Match 3 game went from 10 FPS to 3 FPS :) But then I figured out why it's so slow in the first place. When running Red through Wine, you need to install gdiplus with winetricks, then DRAW in Red is a bit more than 10 times faster. Interesting to note here that the FPS isn't capped to 38 when running in Wine, so timers work better in Wine than they do in Windows 10. But that wasn't the only problem, suddenly recording videos had trouble with Gnome 3's 3D compositing effects, didn't happen in Ubuntu. The desktop background started to flicker in and out of Visual Studio code while recording videos :P I minimized that by setting the desktop background to black, now it happens only every minute or two and it's not that noticeable anymore. Might have been better to use XFCE instead of Gnome, but I didn't want to waste any more time by changing it :)

In this case, and your FSM seems good at a glance to start, are you thinking \*vertical* sensors, on each side rail supporting the racks? Since they won't be submerged, the waterproofing requirement is lower. To experiment, you might just be able to laminate/vacuum seal them.

[22:45](#msg5b5e4392bf754466066ddb6e)I've been reading about IO Monad type from Haskell. Is it purpose to:  
1\) Mark functions as impure (doing IO side effects to be precise)  
2\) Run impure functions more than once (haskell would just run `foo` in `foo foo` only once)  
Am I right? I read that IO Monad carries "a world" but I haven't seen anyone checking for specific world. People check for input type (e.g. integer) but they don't care if a function print or get something. That's seems not \*type-like\*. Well, thank you for any thought on this subject.

I believe there must be thousands of coding youngsters, students, ICT workers and old-timers out there, no millions. And many of them must be seeking alternatives to the mainstream too. So even there is not so much of active presence, the project is in the open and does attract some attention now and then. So what exactly is it that does not trigger interest enough to stick around a little longer?

Well, I have some ideas about this, but I do not want to spoil a good guessing game. Perhaps I am largely overestimating the number of programmers in this world of 7 billion+ people.

[17:56](#msg5b61f443fe0be93f3b286724)Or in the case of a certain company that does work with Rebol, why do the workers not show up in the community more (or are there not many working with Rebol in that company, only the two we see sometimes(?))? Well perhaps because they feel they expose themselves too much to the boss if they did, and know If they ever have to look for another job, they must be prepared for another skill-set?

greggirwin

[18:04](#msg5b61f630854add6cee142c7f)@iArnold research and hard numbers would be great. If there are projects comparable to Red, doing a better job at recruitment, let's learn from them. Otherwise, as you says, it's a guessing game.

BeardPower

[19:16](#msg5b6206f4cb4d5b036cb2887e)@greggirwin Sure, we would need to educate them. There are different exchanges, where you can lock in the exchange rate for 15minutes or more, but fees are higher (about 1.5-3%).

[22:40](#msg5b6236cbc79ebc1ae797a5fd)Forget the details for a moment, and that \*\*we\** \*sort of* know how this all works. This is an entirely new thing to people, and they have bills to pay. We are up against a known quantity that lets them live their lives with less concern. They work and, in many cases, money magically shows up in their bank account, that they've had for 20 years, so they can use their debit card for dinner.

Also, it's quite important to us that if people commit to helping us, forgoing other paying work and free time, that we can fairly compensate them, and eventually provide some stronger guarantees for ongoing work, like real employees, in a commercial company, selling products and services.

[23:16](#msg5b6b79d22a8e6c60839990e7)@abdllhygt interesting! I have few thoughts if you don't mind (`+` is good thing, `-` is bad thing or some error):  
'+ examples - easier to grasp main idea  
'+ colours - I could skip 1st and/or 2nd page and still get it  
'- colours - sometimes colours are wrong or you use the same colors for many things  
'- on the page 4 (am/is/are) you have 2 same examples `A es xini` - I think you mean `A bes xini`  
'- on the page 2 (words) you have personal pronouns (I, you, he... etc) but some of them are confusing. I think you should consider using a table like the (table](https://chakismusings.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/untitled18.png) \[this site](https://chakismusings.wordpress.com/2015/02/05/class-2-functional-english-bscs-first-semester-iqra-university/) - you know if it's singular or plural, gender etc  
'+ I like how you use similar but different suffixes/prefixes (e.g. canti vs canto or es vs bes)  
'- I don't like that you have 2 \[word orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word\_order): 1) `be`: SVO 2) other verbs: VSO  
'- a/the/plural - beside `a` (`a bed`)there is `an` too (`an apple`).  
'- structure of the document - for example past tense is not on 2 adjoining pages  
'+ plural: you change from `s` to `z` (I forgot how it was called) - I would use `n` &gt; `m` for `the house - kasaN` and `house kasaM` but it's your choice  
ps. I'm not professional just like conlangs and stuffs so some of them are more or less "opinions"

[08:22](#msg5b6bf9e02a8e6c60839c2599)@nedzadarek thank you! you maked me happy because of your interest.  
Thanks for correct document wrongs.  
About grammar:  
\- You just don't like mix of SVO and VSO  
\- And maybe about the/an (`kasaM`/`kasaN`)

In Turkish, Arabic, Portuguese and Spanish; subjects are in verbs too. i mean:  
\- bebo água (i drink water)  
\- bebemos água (we drink water)  
(Portugues)  
So, you can understand subjects from verbs' suffixes. And genereally, (in Turkish) we don't use subjects.

[08:24](#msg5b6bfa4b5b07ae730a93865c)In `komu wa`; `wa` is look like a suffix when talking

[08:28](#msg5b6bfb2f179f842c97131872)I guess `SVO` + `VSO` don't make confused, and i like it

nedzadarek

[13:55](#msg5b6c47df637ee66082c8dd70)  
@abdllhygt  
&gt; In Turkish, Arabic, Portuguese and Spanish; subjects are in verbs too. i mean:

We have something like this too: I drink - Ja piję, You drink - ty pijesz, He/she/it - on/ona/ono pije etc - you cannot omit a subject in some cases. But you don't have this feature... as far I can see.

&gt; You just don't like mix of SVO and VSO

I have my reasons:  
1\) I don't think my language changes places of subject &amp; verb in a sentence.  
2)My second language was English and it had SVO for sentences. For \*be* it was VSO so your sentences may sound like questions.

It may differ with native English speaker.

abdllhygt

[14:15](#msg5b6c4c7c637ee66082c8fa40)@nedzadarek  
1\) Turkish has `SOV`. So `VSO` is more difficult/different for Turkishes. But it's more near to a programmer, i guess.

```
komu: func [subject object][...]

komu "wa" "ika"
```

2\) Turkish/Chinese question style is more easy than english. I guess you will get used to it easily.

nedzadarek

[15:56](#msg5b6c6416a3a93d2422408a37)@abdllhygt 1) It depends on a style, for example object oriented programming tends to have SVO - (with definition like `subject: make object! [verb: func [object] [print object * 10]]`) you may call functions like `object1: 42 subject/verb object1`.  
2\) Part of your language is super easy to follow. I wonder if you can put more language features (more tenses, aspects etc).

abdllhygt

[16:06](#msg5b6c6687637ee66082c9a98d)1) it's liwaja markup language:

```
>> a: -es -wta "ta" -i["nagi"]
== make object! [
    text: "you are tall"
]
>> a/text
== "you are tall"
```

i guess if verb is first, it's more near to programming.  
for example, in ruby:

```
"wa".komu "ika"
```

but still `komu` is a `func`  
2\) I didn't finish Liwaja, i improve it with the translator. I think to make a website for learning Liwaja

dander

[23:04](#msg5b7debfcfd3c641b06f6c0df)I didn't want to derail the red/docs discussion about paths, but I've been wondering for a while about the design decision for selecting on a `none` value to cause an error instead of returning `none` itself.

```
>> thing: [a [b 1]]
== [a [b 1]]
>> thing/a/b
== 1
>> thing/a/c
== none
>> thing/b/c
*** Script Error: path thing/b/c is not valid for none! type
```

[23:06](#msg5b7dec75f5402f32aa7a1ff3)Is there a common way of making `thing/b/c` return `none` instead? It seems like a common pattern, especially when working with external data.

gltewalt

[23:07](#msg5b7decc1e5b40332abe4e581)`attempt [thing/b/c]`

greggirwin

[23:07](#msg5b7deccbf86b741b05ac426e)`None` propagation is a tricky subject. It seems nice to just cover up all errors, but at some point it makes it harder to reason about \*anything\*, because you don't get helpful errors.

dander

[23:09](#msg5b7ded3738a12915e4e14154)Yeah, that's the next thing I was going to ask. Perhaps the existing behavior is safest because it 'fails fast', which encourages better upstream code

greggirwin

[23:09](#msg5b7ded431d3a5711b684a724)Ultimately, each type defines how actions work for them. If an action makes no sense for a type, it should throw an error. So even if `none` worked that way, integers, words, and others would still fail.

[23:10](#msg5b7ded81fd3c641b06f6cb21)In the case of a path evaluation, you wouldn't know where in the path it failed.

[23:11](#msg5b7ded9c1d3a5711b684a90a)mmhmm

dander

[23:12](#msg5b7dedd060f9ee7aa479d595)Thanks, that helps a lot. I think for the case where I don't care, `attempt` seems just right. It hadn't occurred to me that it returns `none` if it fails

[23:15](#msg5b7dee814be56c591880e6c7)To the point of knowing where it failed, it seems like the error could be a bit better. It tells you the path, but not \_where_ in the path it failed.

[08:42](#msg5b850ae5ff445156164ba537)Continutation from /help chanel. @greggirwin - Now back to corporate environment, as it is quite interesting topic imo. Thinking about your question about the obvious choice of the language in corporation. I would almost dare to say - none. There are platforms - SAP, Microsoft, Google, others (.e.g IBM Websphere). So it is mostly a ABAP, .Net, JAVA I can't see some other language being penetrated, unless it is part of some "platform". So - it is not necessarily about the language being preset in terms of the browser, but rather browser being a front-end platform. And well established one, I have to say. Maybe it is because of IT personel being a bit lazy, but most probably because it is being convenient. Imagine installing some app to group of ppl. Some companies would have to do it manually, those skilled ones have to define packages and install via a domain policy. From that perspective, it is obvious, why IT admins like systems targetting a browser - because all they have to do is just - nothing. Situation with mobile devices is of course different - ppl prefer native apps. OTOH I have seen the responsive web app and an icon referring to website added to the desktop (on mobile). As for PCs, I can't see a trend of ppl turning back to native apps, yet ...

But it's the same in the browser going against JS, right? Wasm may come, but it's a new an unknown quantity. You're as experienced as anyone in business IT, at many levels, but, like the rest of us, all you have is anecdotal evidence and opinion.

[16:54](#msg5b857e49ff445156164e6a57)What \*would* help us make more informed decisions is concrete evidence. Studies that show trends in hard numbers, analysis of other tools and langs, their number of users, who pays how much, etc. \*Business* research and analysis.

[22:38](#msg5b8f095611b41f69dbbf56b0)@Oldes I don't think so. You could write `read/as STREAM int32` - I would assume that `int32` is some kind of encoding. It's ok for now. `read/as STREAM [int32 string]` - are you reading `int32` or `string`? I don't think it's \*possible\*. So maybe `int32` \*\*then\** `string`? Make sense.  
I think you just need to teach them. In my opinion, it's not far jump from `read/as file encoding` to `read/as stream [type1 type2]`.

[12:20](#msg5b926d241d3a5711b6fa3b32)Why some languages take off example of nodejs from which Red community could reflect upon :)

The community first just ignored original hacker news thread announcing Node received zero comments and only got 8 points. If you know anything about Hacker news that's not exactly an overwhelming response. Once people did start paying attention to it their response wasn't particularly charitable towards the project.

Ryan was facing a decidedly uphill battle though most developers had to use javascript on the browser with regularity. Many were not comfortable with the idea of running it on the server.

In January 2010 Isaac Schlueter created a package manager he called NPM the Node package manager. Another early days boon for note came from synergy with a small obscure database project MongoDB in early 2009.

The MVC framework ExpressJs was released in November 2010 by T.J. Holloway Express was in many ways NodeJs for the masses.

Many of the new breed of know Js developers those who adopted the platform after 2012 or so adopted the platform not because of node's runtime but because of its ecosystem and the speed and ease with which they could build applications with tools like Express and with the plethora of available NPM modules without having to learn code itself or care much about how it worked.

One of the users asked to clarify this:

&gt; "Dependent types allow types to be predicated on values, meaning that some aspects of a program’s behaviour can be specified precisely in the type."

Here was my answer:

In "normal" languages if you want to add 2 vectors they must be the same length (let's just assume this for simplicity). You will do something like:

```
f: func [v1 [vector!] v2 [vector!]] [
 either (length? v1) = (length? v2) ["do something with vectors"] [error "not equal"]
]
```

With dependent types values are in types. You need specify dependent type like this `vector! LENGTH`. So, in pseudo code, it would like this:

```
g: func [v1 [vector! N] v2 [vector! N]] [
  ; do something with vectors
]
```

Or adding 2 vectors: \`vector! N vector! M =&gt; return vector! (N + M)

[15:10](#msg5b9294ce8034a7717df4338e)@endo64 interesting approach (language design) takes \[the J](www.jsoftware.com). You can "do things" with a collections of the same length. It will just do things with n-th element, `a/1 OP b/1`, `a/2 op b/2` etc:

```
1 2 3 * 4 5 6
4 10 18
```

Or you can "do things" with a collection and a scalar (1 value). It will "do things" with every element of that collection and a scalar:

```
1 2 3 * 2
2 4 6
```

[15:11](#msg5b92952a4be56c5918f710b8)ps. it's more complicated but at the level of vector/scalar it's easy.

9214

[15:15](#msg5b929624c2bd5d117a329d98)@nedzadarek the thing you talk about is called a rank. `*` has a rank of 0 for both operands, which means that it operates on individual atoms and produces a result with a shape (another concept) of the larger operand. Which means that your explanation is a bit misleading - `*` always operates element-wise, unless you explicitly specify rank with `"`.

&gt; The only difference is the abstraction on how you can write to memory.

That's what I'm talking about. With the BF you do most of the things. With the Red you just say "I want block" and the language/compiler/magic-system/WHATEVER do it \*\*for you\*\*.

&gt; No, memory management is not done by the language.

Of course you are right. The language is nothing more than set of rules. It cannot set even 1 bit. What I mean is that the rules (of the language) describes that if we write, for example, `[42]` the compiler/interpreter/magic should put an information that you have created a container with a number `42`.  
... but do I have to be that precise?

&gt; And what is your point? Red is different to any other language because of that.

There are languages with similar feature - so it's not that only Red/Rebol have collections that you don't need to "describe" as in the C. And it's only one feature. There are more features. You may see one feature in 10 languages. Another feature can be only in the Red/Rebol.

&gt; because of the way it works under the hood.

I don't think it's not "work under the hood". Correct me if I'm wrong but when you say `arr: [42]`, any implementation of the Red should allow this construct and an access to that block (e.g. `print arr/1`).

&gt; \[42] vs. int a = 42; -&gt; how is that similar?

[23:35](#msg5b9af4423b7e6c2edd130c0c)@nedzadarek by the way, traditional Forths treat any set of non-whitespace characters as a valid token. Which means that you can treat any ASCII text as a program, provided that you have all the necessary words defined.

nedzadarek

[12:12](#msg5b9f9a1db9531f2dfa7c7fe3)@BeardPower yes, "fractional as index" doesn't make sense to me too. As for normal indexing. As Vladimir shown :point\_up: \[17 września 2018 00:41](https://gitter.im/red/chit-chat?at=5b9edc06b9531f2dfa785b37) we can use it for interpolation.

BeardPower

[12:14](#msg5b9f9abe3b7e6c2edd2ccdc7)Yes, but its interpolating the value, so you just interpolate it directly without the need to use an index. Linear interpolation does not need an index and using an index for interpolation is all but logically.

[12:20](#msg5b9f9c27f08bc22dfb6cde2c)Even in @9214 's example it shows it's uselessness. It only works because the index value is floored, which is just creating an integral value again. If it would be usable, there would be no need for this step.

[12:30](#msg5b9f9e7da56b215c974ea460)@BeardPower  
&gt; Accessing memory at the 4.33 cell index. What exactly would that be?

If you have:

```
arr: [
  [1 2 3 ..]
  [1 2 3 ..]
]
```

and you can just `arr/2/3` to get 3rd value from a 2nd block. Index 2.3 could mean the same as `.../2/3`. I prefer normal indexing (`arr/2/3`) but you asked. And we have `path` that I can do more than mere `float!`.

To be honest it might not be good for lot of people but for few % might like it and need it.  
And... it might not make sense to me or you but it's nice to experiment. You can see how far you can push the language or your knowledge about given subject. Sometimes stupid idea leads to interesting innovation.

9214

[12:35](#msg5b9f9fa81ee2ca65022c16c7)@nedzadarek I finally remembered \[where](https://github.com/xunker/array-subindex) I saw this before.

nedzadarek

[12:50](#msg5b9fa32f7dca306503136d93)@BeardPower  
&gt; path! has nothing in common with float!

I mean usage of `float!`/`integer!` vs `path!`. With number you can just pick position. With path you can do more:  
\- number indexing: `'arr/1`  
\- sub-indexing `'arr/1/2`  
\- using words as index `'arr/foo`  
\- you can index by other types, e.g. `paren!`: `'arr/(:foo)`

BeardPower

[13:08](#msg5b9fa75c54587954f9b60f09)A path is also using integers, but this little detail aside. integer! and float! have a complete different usage and meaning compared to path. It's like comparing apple with oranges.

[10:33](#msg5ba8bd8233da0f649e46718a)@Oldes I'm not native speaker (Polish) so take it with a grain of salt.  
I think `at` or `goto` is better than `seek`.  
\[seek](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/seek):  
&gt; to try to \*\*find\** or get something

To me it's more vague. For example:  
&gt; If symptoms persist seek medical attention .

What kind of "medical attention"?

\[at](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/at)  
&gt; used to show an \*\*exact\** position or particular place

So it's more precise than "seek". A problem with "at" is it doesn't "talk about tense" (past, present and future).  
In the Rebol/Red (correct me if I'm wrong) it's used with the "help" of other words, e.g. `head (insert (at [1 2 3 4] 2) 111)`. So the order is 1) you do `at` 2) do something with that.

"go to" there is no entry in the cambridge dictionary but from my knowledge (of programming languages) it tells you to "go to particular place in the code". I think it's more self sufficient than `at`. However it had "bad past" - people might not like it.

[13:37](#msg5ba8e88dbe4f300626decc85)It's a little confusing that you can pass boxed values to routines.

9214

[13:37](#msg5ba8e893d655361f7647d50a)AFAIK only integers and booleans will be automatically boxed.

[13:37](#msg5ba8e89e5df519473407685b)If you pass them from R/S to Red, that is.

BeardPower

[13:38](#msg5ba8e8c4e5c2cc56add7b8da)Why are they even passed as boxed values? When passing it to a routine?

[13:39](#msg5ba8e9085df5194734076986)And why even type/value?

[13:39](#msg5ba8e91c1ee2ca6502628943)It's not the same as when working in R/S.

[13:40](#msg5ba8e935b9531f2dfab31daf)So when someone is used to code routines he will get shot into the foot in R/S.

greggirwin

[15:55](#msg5bb78977435c2a518e57c942)@yvendruscolo it's a good question, as Red's strength comes largely from its literal forms for values. What we need to do is figure out if there's a nice notation that could be used, which doesn't conflict with existing syntax or block other obvious uses. Then see if the existing set of actions make sense for it, or if it's better off as a module with functions that map to the needs. For compound types, the obvious starting point is to use blocks, even if they're a little more verbose.

nedzadarek

[21:12](#msg5bb7d3b364cfc273f99fec25)@dander I think It is possible but I am not sure if someone should do this. As @9214 said, there are many question to answer.  
One thing that no one mentioned is: what if you want to add more types? What if someone want to use the same or similar syntax to your syntax? I am not an expert but I think it could get messy.  
In my opinion we should develop some kind of a \*user defined type* system. This way you do not have to care about other user types. Check \[this](https://github.com/nedzadarek/red\_custom\_type\_proposal) to see what I mean.

moliad

[21:16](#msg5bb7d4bc600c5f64235ce8b0)There is already a universal, extensible syntax for datatypes. It is fully supported in Rebol2 and partially in Red, no need to invent a new one. (R2 serialied format, probably has a different name in Red, this naming was not universally liked by some influential rebolers)

a lexical plugin is not impossible to do which would allow lexical extensions... we are already looking into it at work.

nedzadarek

[21:18](#msg5bb7d52a82893a2f3ba65bd0)@moliad can you post an example?

moliad

[21:24](#msg5bb7d6786e5a401c2d21c926)the general form is :

```
#[datatype!   optional  datatype-specific data ]
```

ex :

```
#[none!]   #[string! "1234" 3]  #[function! [x][print x]]
```

[21:25](#msg5bb7d6d764cfc273f9a00211)here the lexical boundary is the

```
#[
```

pattern which is unique to this alternate representation of Rebol values (you can get them using mold/all, even in Red)

[21:28](#msg5bb7d79b435c2a518e59c7b9)a few values also get their even simpler notation without the datatype! prefix:  
ex:

```
#[true] #[false] #[none]
```

nedzadarek

[21:31](#msg5bb7d842bbdc0b2505f0faef)@moliad how would you define complex numbers using such syntax? For simplicity assume:  
\- &lt;integer&gt;j&lt;integer&gt; for example: `2j4`  
\- define `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` for them - just output some text in the form `operation * on 2j3 and 4j4`

moliad

[21:32](#msg5bb7d8793844923661ee1040)if ports have a similar interface to Rebol they may allow for custom datatypes with little effort. "all" (not that it's easy) that would be needed is to allow to run-time extending the list of datatype! names, and assign them to a new reference port! (like a new scheme, which matches the scheme part of a url!), which will run user actions when encountering a value of that type.

[21:36](#msg5bb7d94782893a2f3ba6742e)there would be two parts, a port which you can define actions(perhaps not all of them), like any internal type, and a serialized value which allows you to store them. If an equivalent port spec is setup in the system.

We could then see about extending the lexical analysis with a simple parse pattern. (the specifics and performance would be affected depending on various implementation decisions, obviously).

[21:40](#msg5bb7da5b1e23486b93945a17)I'm talking about port! because it is already a system allowing to integrate the run-time action handling of a dataset via a mezzanine specification, via handling of a url! .

If we just accept that maybe the source data is not a url! but a block with rebol loadable data, then we essentially have the exact same pattern.

[21:41](#msg5bb7da925331811c2e56b0de)since the team is starting to look at reworking or creating the port! system... adding this right-away might be almost free.

[02:51](#msg5bc15da2ef4afc4f2865cd25)You never need a GPU, but its a massively parallel chip and a lot of the transistors in it could be refurbished into voxel rendering instead. it would probably be a massive speed increase. IMHO the only issue is the amount of RAM actually needed. it may be the problem about using a GPU. even with 8 GB ram, its not much when you realize you can easily have a scene with tens of billions of voxels...

[02:52](#msg5bc15dedf659e67772a8fd05)like anything you can generate some of them on the fly via math, but the real appeal of voxels is the fact they are not generated by math but a sample. so you can VERY easily manipulate them.. in fact not much more difficult than any 2D pixel manipulations.

BeardPower

[10:18](#msg5bc1c6896e5a401c2d64a0d8)Yes, it's not any different than Pixels, but with a depth. The GPU is a massive parallel chip yes, but optimized for rasterization. A better solution would be something like Epiphany, Larabee etc. You could just use normal DDR RAM. The Voxels use textures a lot, so you would still need fast texture units. Voxels can be compressed very well. The 5GB crocodile asset could be compressed down to 20MB.

[10:20](#msg5bc1c6e5271506518d053eab)Only the Voxels you can see would be in a pixel resolution and the rest has adaptive LOD. Each Voxel can have a different LOD.

@DonaldTsang, if you want to pursue various Red-related projects, that's great. We've ruled out Discord as a channel, so that's off the table for now. We're a small team, and spread thin already.

You can't just say "Lang X is more popular, so do what they do and you'll be popular too." It just doesn't work that way. Also, we don't need to succeed at the level of Rust, Go, and Nim. Think bigger.

[19:44](#msg5bc7911e64cfc273f9e1ac6c)@maximvl how many years of alphas has red gone through when compared to Python, Java, JS and C? And do a trajectory to see if it is being ahead (fast shipping of product) or behind (stuck in alpha/early beta)

[19:46](#msg5bc791931c100a4f29a09bf7)When I say "get the kids" I don't mean weakening red's codebase but rather, on a human level, understand what they want, need, and care about. Treat them like your sons and daughters and nephews and nieces, and see what their feedback was.

[19:51](#msg5bc792c7ae7be9401672eabf)There are reasons why Python, Java and JS succeed, they all have a few things in common (a) A large library (b) A "need" in the industry (big data, compiled package, web development) (c) Relative ease of learning and developing, which all leads to youth program projects about their Anime and Comics written in Python and JS (and more recently, Go)

greggirwin

[20:29](#msg5bc79ba6271506518d2a8a37)@DonaldTsang your analysis is flawed. You can't boil success down to those things, even for just those languages, or compare us to them without looking at the bigger picture (e.g. who was behind Java, the timing and position of JS, etc.). There is no silver bullet. There are things we can do, and want to do, but they won't guarantee success. And since we can't do everything, we have to choose. That said, if you believe in what you say, and you want Red to succeed, \*GO FOR IT!\*.

[20:35](#msg5bc79d29f659e67772d11d62)@DonaldTsang Take it with the grain of salt (because I am not an expert only language enthusiast) but I think you are little wrong. Your (a), (b) and (c) points are very important. However, I think (b) was the main cause of their success ( (c) played an important role).  
&gt; which all leads to youth program projects about their Anime and Comics written in Python and JS (and more recently, Go)

Python has more than mere libraries. You can write interactive fiction using Ren'py (I think it is nice for teachers to demonstrate learning materials). You can build 3D games/things in Blender3D.  
Javascript, on the other hand, is \*lingua franca* of the internet. You can use libraries like p5.js to build interesting stuffs. In order to share it you just need to upload it somewhere.

[14:07](#msg5bcdd994c7bf7c36625078ad)@rebolek the Red's console has black&amp;white colours.  
It depends how capable is the console. I'm using the Red's console for short code and copy-paste some longer code that I just need to see the output. The Red's console is not that good so I'm using text editor that that uses different colours for different things (set word, word), ability to hide part of the code... etc. Here colours are important.  
Ruby's pry is more capable than Red's console (it's not build-in). As fair I remember you could even edit a part of the code so colours are "important" here.

First, I wanted to be it to be readable - so no `binary!` representation.

You have to know how to store certain informations as a string. It is easier to just use a `block!`... and If I cannot use "set-syntax" I will just use `put`.

[13:09](#msg5c052b1a1c439034af0faef7)@viayuve The OS is using a HAL. Any other part is architecture agnostic and I need to start on what I have, which is X86. I don't have a SPARC or PPC any more. The Mill is currently in hush-mode. No public simulator yet, but the HAL is not much work. To create an OS entirely with Red and Red/System, it would need a lot of work on those itself (exposing I/O, supervisor/priviledged opcodes, static libs, archives, object files). Those features would also allow us to write/port a firmware (OpenFirmware, Coreboot, Libreboot) to Red and Red/System as well.

[00:05](#msg5c0b0aac26de6f08229cf651)@gltewalt I think it is possible but we are far from doing this. \*We* are kind of good at simpler games (e.g MarI/O) but not so good at androids (I do not read about this topic so pardon my ignorance).  
It is off topic, but I think programming languages are going to make solutions based on end-goal and facts/knowledge (logic/constraint programming - e.g. Picat, Wolfram - language with build-in knowledge).  
@greggirwin Is it really necessary to define "bugs"? What if we define end goal (e.g. a file has been saved, some text has been printed etc)?

greggirwin

[01:23](#msg5c0b1d05178d7860a1a0dd64)A bug is just failing to meet a clearly defined goal. If we're talking about a library or implementation of a feature with clear inputs and outputs, that's possible, but still a lot of work. But if we're talking about a \*language\*, how do you define the end goal? This is where a definitive spec for the syntax/grammar of the language comes in. Once you have that, then you have to define the semantics. @gltewalt asked:

&gt; Could a programming language fix its own bugs? (Theoretically)

Which is even more interesting, because it then has to rely on itself, which may be subject to bugs. Can it fix bugs it can't find due to bugs?

This is the real problem. Even if Red runs there, who will pay for it? If R2 runs there today, and works well, why aren't people clamoring to pay for it?

[07:51](#msg5c0b780828907a3c7be7bead)@greggirwin ten years ago there where no market for second hand expensive servers. Now those machine have been dismissed from data centers and there have been a big explosion in their market. Price low and request and solutions based on them is very high. The same for those tablet. They have been dismissed from big companies which are able to purchase newer ones and their market is now exploding..  
I am not giving you anecdotal evidence but a market analysis, and also a business opportunity for many of us. I have planned the adoption in my company because of such fluorishing market.I know this as I have been involved in the direct business for some years. RED is the perfect swiss knife for those machines. This market is now and not at REBOL2 times where those machines were priced at 3500USD.  
Also I think that Release 0.6.4 or 0.7.0 could be perfect for being be the last to support. Garbage collector is here and it is a big plus.

[07:54](#msg5c0b78b8f4880a60a245ba85)Ok, lets change my request: please support XP at 0.6.x branch and no more. It is just one or two releases and it should not drain RED resources.

I love \[Node-red](https://nodered.org/), but it's strongly focused on IoT and is based on Javascript, as is \[NoFlo](https://noflojs.org/) . Rebol claimed to be a "messaging" language, so it seems to me (I'm a civil engineer, not a developer) that Redbol would be suited do develop a general purpose Flow Based framework.

Here we are in a different scenario: lot of powertful and working machines being dismissed at very cheap price and offering the same kind of capability of solutions which costs 10,15 times more. For order entry, inventory and data entry they are the perfect choice and RED 0.6.4 already has all the features needed to run on those machines (gui able to manage big buttons, reading writing of files, small database capability, small memory footprint)

The only feature missing to create a good solution that runs on cheap xp machines has been the garbage collector as we are talking about 1GB/2GB XP tablets.  
Release 0.6.3 has already as much is needed for those kind of panels/data entry applications so dropping support know that we have GC is like firing a shot on our feets because we are at 99,9% of waiting to have the tool we need. It is like downloading 1000TB of data and interrupting it at 999,99TB.

"RED with his 1MB executable size and being able to run on old hardware could give new life to your old touch panels/tablet PC"

As business rule: everything could be an business opportunity under a different light. Don't forget that even old furniture become valuable as when seen as antiquity.

Vladimir, when you have written "Perhaps this is the time when you all move to chit-chat" when discussion was increasing its power, created the percepetion of "tone" and "authority not liking the argument" and forcing us to move away . Other people felt RED/RED was appropriate to talk about RED but those words coming from you, as memeber with "punitive powers" like exclusion of the group, let me feel intimidating and I "obeyed". Please remember that discussing with you it not like doing this with any other on different view, it discussing on a different point a view and the authority at the same time. So it is difficult to sustain a disagreement or an unpopular point of view, under the danger of being excluded if you continue and the authority became "upset".

[21:21](#msg5c0d87523de4e816e236a2b0)Even though this is chit-chat, everybody should try to remain civil.

Related to @nedzadarek's question about user support: User support is \*great\*. And the Foundation will likely reward people for their efforts. Open source seems to work best when people contribute to solve their own problems (because problems usually affect groups, others can benefit).

On XP, if someone wants to take on supporting it, again, the Foundation will probably reward them with RED tokens and say "Go Go Go!". Others can also offer bounties. Just because the core team isn't doing it, doesn't mean we don't want to see it done.

@GiuseppeChillemi, opportunities are great, but seldom free, or without strings attached. If you think we haven't considered XP support deeply, you're wrong. Please respect that we make the best decisions we can, even if you don't agree with them.

Gregg, as 0.6.4 is already here and it works on XP, and it is the most important component for older machines, I think that if any side effect arise on XP while fixing it, that side effect could be fixed too. It should take 0,0000001% of your time and you have the maximum result. Then, no more development. Stop here !.

Yes, XP is old, so people should upgrade long time ago.  
Yes, the Red is in the alpha stage so there could be many changes that break some things.  
When a software hit 1.0 version I expect some kind of warnings like "X will not be supported in the version 1.2, use Y".

I'm not sure about the Smalltalk, but the Ruby's lambdas are less powerful than Red/Rebol's blocks. For example `print [a a a]` could output `1 2 3`- I'm not sure how to do this in the Ruby.

&gt; functions like get-data, get-field, get table... they all share similar paramaters like table-name, storage-name, data . When I have repeated entering those parameters in the function headers, I started thinking about writing them in a "select" block and then retrieving the parameters specs from it to avoid retyping them each time or changing the parameters once and for all.

It sounds like \[Ruby's attribute reader/writer/accessor](https://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/UsersGuide/rg/accessors.html) but plus some another features. I guess your `get-data` is not simply accessing field like `m: #(a: 1) m/a` so you need to "compute" something.

[15:11](#msg5c20f70acac5bc2241df2f10)&gt; Like parametric GUIs , I think we could have parametric functions/object created in your script starting from common specifications. You create the code from data specs and/or compose it from a library of "proto" functions.

The Red is very capable of doing this. We create function creators (I think there were better name for it). @rebolek created \[a function creator](http://red.qyz.cz/dependent-types.html) that allows you to assert some conditions about arguments (for example an argument should be smaller than 1000).

About programming and the Ruby:  
I think what Lepinekong meant was like Semseddin said:  
&gt; people who hate coding with complex bloated programming languages that requires hundred MBs tools, dependencies and IDEs.

The Ruby and the Red/Rebol has \*similar* goals: "make human-readable language" and "Rebol against complexity" respectively.  
The Ruby language is compact and easy to read by human. I got similar feelings when I was programming in the Red/Rebol (thought it could be better).

&gt; It's not an issue of the language but obviously some personal hate against programming. No language will help you with that. Ruby on rails is just a framework using Ruby. You still need to program in Ruby. There are a lot of people who can get cool things done even in Assembler. The language is just a tool. No framework or language is a magic bullet getting cool things done by just clicking on a button. Neither RoR nor Red.

No language is a magic bullet but it's a huge help. It plays important role. People could code in the Assembly languages very productive. I could program some gui using old Borland c++ things without knowing how the language draw on the screen.
