[23:51](#msg61d4dd9bd41a5853f9345a4a)Thanks @loziniak. The license bits jumped out at me most, but Go being tied tightly to git I had forgotten about. Simplicity comes at a cost.

On licenses, a key aspect for me is that GPL protects the software being used, but doesn't (I'm happy to be corrected) stop people from using it in any way, commercially, even without disclosure that they are doing so. In that sense, it's not much different than more permissive licenses in practical use.

The cynic in me asks: Has free software "won"? Has it raised awareness and motivated people to make conscious decisions about how it's used? No. Not by a long shot. Those building it are still at the bottom of the totem pole, in all respects.

[00:22](#msg61d4e4bad41a5853f9346761)My guess is that throwing money at something means strict oversight due to costs vs profits, and at the top level of "best software", consequences and financial incentives usually trump teams of volunteers.

greggirwin

[02:17](#msg61d4ff9e526fb77b3162ef57)So what happens if FOSS developers collectively give the world the finger? Or, what if we can incentivize the best developers to move to a more equitable model, and free riders will find themselves working harder to compete because "free" software has stagnated (think security issues). They'll pay the fare if they have to, but not if they don't. We're all like that to some extent.

[20:14](#msg61d74d9a5ee4df335ad016d7)@zentrog:matrix.org +1. I have a hard time not pushing harder when it happens, and have to remind myself that a break is needed. For me, it helps to read something or watch a movie, anything that forces my brain away from what it's latched onto. Frisbee with a friend (because I'm terrible and can only think about how bad I am).

hiiamboris

[20:55](#msg61d75756e1a1264f0a42e265)@gltewalt:matrix.org it depends. I notice two things generally:  
\- When my mind feels like it's going to blow. This happens only on the most complex design work. This is physiological: brain has consumed too much blood oxygen and needs "recharge". To restore it, any motoric activity is great. General health state and diet can affect it.  
\- When I'm exhausted with some boring task. Like beating at some bug for hours. This is psychosomatic: induced by the emotional state. A walk helps, but generally if you can learn to watch and affect your state you can counter it. Simplest example may be to turn on some music (if you're receptive to it): if it feels like you're crushing bugs from an Imperial Death Star, it changes everything :)

[19:09](#msg61dc846846529077f57a14c0)@dsunanda it's a human problem, and each of us is unique. I know you know this, and while I like working with you as a programmer, our long friendship is based on my respect for the kind of human you are, and inspire me to be.

With that preface in place, I can feel his pain a bit. When I learned of Aaron Schwartz, via a documentary, it broke my heart. I wanted to rise up and fight back. I hope that, on balance, my actions leave the world a better place. But as \[The Proclaimers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrHaAIbUG0o) say so eloquently, I might not be there yet. ;^) At the same time, do my good deeds commit me to a life of do-goodery? I don't want to be either the redeemed or the fallen, whose final act defines them. Just hoping for a decent batting average.

[22:22](#msg61e49aa5e1a1264f0a5d0a10)@dsunanda I think we do have distinguish between drawing graphics as a demo, and building GUI apps. Can Red do what that demo does? You bet. See the tiger SVG demo at about 1:30 in \[the original Android teaser](https://www.red-lang.org/2018/04/sneak-peek-at-red-on-android.html). Our Android branch is out of date, and some things have to be synced with VID. e.g. there's no native `switch` style on desltop OSs.

One of the brilliant things that it looks like Processing \*may* do (but hard to tell from demos), and I know that Delphi does for sure, is having a simple menu option to build and sync to a mobile device. It needs to be that easy. It's doable though. Probably 5 years ago I did a Red demo at a conference, where I cross compiled to Win/DOS/Nix/Mac OSs from Windows from a simple script. So once Android is in place, it's just `call red -c -t Android` and sync it.

[19:57](#msg61f990ba5dc6213cd40ef79e)On Tiobe vs PYPL. Web pages vs trending tutorial searches. e.g. PYPL:

&gt; The more a language tutorial is searched, the more popular the language is assumed to be.

Ummmm, No. That tells you nothing about actual use. I've searched for a lot of lang info which is not an indication of me actually \*using* those languages. I imagine a lot of people search for trendy langs, but still have to use old ones at their day job. We do have to account for influencers and such, but we also have to ask what aspect of "popularity" is important, especially in the context of Red, rather than keeping our resumes looking fresh.

Even tools like https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull\_requests/2021/4 can't paint a complete picture, though it would be interesting to take all the major language indexes and see how they compare.

I doubt it's possible, and certainly wouldn't be easy, to collect global stats on language use, installed code in production, changes over time, etc. It's not a technical problem, not entirely anyway, but a people problem. That's what \*I* care about though. What languages are used most now, have had the longest life and biggest impact, and provided the most value. That's what we want Red to achieve.

The WIX engine is able to output the APPS for Google Play and also for the Apple store, in a modular way. It assembles, adds, and personalizes the code from a common base, then it builds and creates the APPs and publishes them. During this journey, I have thought a lot about Red, the experiments I have made using code segments taken from a library, binding and assembling them. I think that RED is well suited for such kinds of jobs, and would be the perfect tool for any company needing modular output. You have just to pick the needed code segments, assemble them, parametrize the contexts with values relevant to the target ambient and compile the APP.  
If you take a look to our site:  
https://www.ravioldoro.it/  
You will discover that many parts of it are replicated on the apps, like the product catalog, the members management:

Docker works in a way that every time you run it (like kskarthik/redlang) it runs like it's all a fresh install, so this compiling is going on every time. Is this compilation very system dependant or is it possible to recompile this once, take that linux binary and posti it somewhere, so docker script can download it and start with that? Docker has a way to pesist things, by mapping to external (host system) folders, but that complicates the docker script/setup and is usually more meant for data.

Is there a reason this needs to run on Docker? Not to second guess Oto, and we can include a general readme for all Red solutions but, to save you both pain, is that enough? People can see the code to compare, and if they are interested, they can install Red themselves. I'm happy to include the output for a run from mine as well.

He doesn't need to use docker if I understand correctly, but he uses a Nixos/Nix which is somewhat similar, in the way that it's declarative / reproducible package manager where you don't do anything "by hand" but it all must be scripted and so whole system can be reproduces anywhere ...

What I've come to understand, and I'd \*love* to be wrong about this, is that it doesn't \*really* solve the problem. It pushes it around a bit, and may help a lot in certain situations. That seems to be enough for people. What it \*doesn't* solve is the same problem OSs have with versioned infrastructure pieces, e.g. language runtimes.

This is an important area to me, because Red can make things much easier, or much worse.

[08:36](#msg6200d9f93349fe1c71fc26f2)@greggirwin: @BaronRK I don't quite understand what you mean by "ready to go", so I may be responding to the wrong aspect. In my experience, starting up a container is pretty quick ~1 sec or so. You do of course need a running linux host, and if the container image isn't already present, it will take time to download proportional to its size (that part may or may not be cached). I think the main purpose of containers though is about packaging up an application along with its OS dependencies in a way that you don't need to worry about the configuration of the host OS where it runs. It also sandboxes it, and presents a consistent API for configuring and securing the application. I guess I would agree that it does push the problems around more than it solves them, but it does standardize how the problems are solved, which can be leveraged a lot.

In my view, Red could work pretty well within the container ecosystem because it has the potential to make very capable microservices in a small size. And that means you can host more of them with lower hardware constraints, which equates to cost savings at scale.

Oldes

[09:12](#msg6200e26803f270478221d1ec)I think it should be easy to prepare a docker image, where the console is already precompiled... I bet it will be just one line in the `Dockerfile`.

[20:35](#msg62018286d4102444804ebd22)One thing to keep in mind is that Docker is pretty low-level. It's like the interface between the application and OS. I spent a few weeks recently learning kubernetes, and it is insanely complex, though it's the kind of thing you need if you are building a globally scalable application. My analogy for it is like a distributed operating system.

I view everything in terms of key frames and deltas.  
In C terms this would be Exe, Obj, then below that Source code.

If a Docker fires up, and needs to compile to update stuff each time, that could be slow.

If it can follow along and keep things updated, so the nEXT person can benefit from the resulting Obj or Exes, wonderful.

I'm a fan of the Docker concept. I just don't know how hard it is to keep it fast on going.

zentrog:matrix.org

[08:56](#msg620381b703f2704782273ae2)That makes sense. A lot of that depends on how the container is made. For red, it’s not hard to have the console compilation already done. Some sorts of things are harder to do ahead of time though, and it’s also pretty easy to waste a lot of space. Harder to be lean and efficient, unfortunately.

Agreed @BaronRK . I've been talking with @toomasv about app templates and such. I sent him some old R2 code, one project being EasyList (one of many Easy* projects :^), which was a very simple engine that let you write an entire CRUD app like this:

```
do %easy-list-x01.r

spec: [
    List of albums
    Each album has
        title
        artist
        "catalog number"

[21:11](#msg62115d0d3ae95a1ec161685d)For those of us (which is probably most of us) who roam far beyond the big dozen or so websites (Facebook, Youtube, TikTok, ...) we probably need several browsers for different destinations.

My daily use is a heavily locked down (via add-ons and settings) Firefox.

For websites I trust and which won’t work with those security measures, I use lightly locked-down Firefox Developer (basically the latest Beta).

For websites I trust but won’t work in any variant of Firefox, I use a strongly locked down Vivaldi (a Chromium derivative).

And then once a year or so when I absolutely have to take a suicidal leap of faith, I’ll run a completely-out-of-the-box Edge.

And then client-side browser either refuses to download the website; or it crafts a tailored sandbox just for that website and what it claims to need.

We've now effectively Dockerized the web .... Which will slow the bad guys down by about six months.

[01:10](#msg62197dec0909252318fa53ff)A couple quick guesses. 1) It's written in Pascal/Delphi/Lazarus. 2) It's not creating a data structure in memory, per se. It's scanning the file and marking data locations so they can be viewed on demand as you expand the items. It is a viewer only, and note that there's no `expand all` feature in the viewer, as that would be a massive amount of overhead for large files.

This is not to take anything away from them. It's a clean tool and seems very nice. Exporting the data as XML was lightning fast. Finding text was also fast. It does what it says it does, and is optimized for this one purpose. $200 annual license. If you need what it does, it's probably worth it.

It took it .14s to load their 26M file. Red took 7.5s. 53x slower. Their RAM use was 36M, ours was 466M.

We can't spare any of the team to have fun experimenting on a fast structured data viewer, which could be done a few ways for comparison (`parse`, R/S, JSON fast lexer based on Red's), but if someone else wants to do that, we'll sponsor it.

[06:54](#msg6219ce8a6b912423200a0c84)That's what I thought, that they actually read a top structure, without a further expansion. We could do that with streamed parsing Doc envisioned probably. As for the speed, R/S is supposed to be slover than C, but Delphi was never a speed deamon either. As for the RAM, once again - streamed parsers might be a better fit in future.

[18:55](#msg621a77bc0466b352a4f2c38c)@pekr, actually, Pascal and P-Code BASICs could be pretty fast, and Delphi can be very fast for certain things.

For this task we wouldn't even need stream parsing, but just using `parse` on data that large, e.g. `parse <26M-string> [some skip]`, may take a full second or more. But R/S will scream through it. Then it's a matter of only using `parse` on small pieces, between markers, which will be instant to a user's eyes.

@rebolek makes the point clearly, which we also face in Red with `skip/offset?` vs `at/pick/index?`. One of the main reasons some devs prefer, and argue for, zero-based addressing is calculating offsets based on element sizes. This makes sense in lower level languages, and even some dialects perhaps (e.g. R/S), where you're mapping indexes to offsets, but it makes index accuracy suffer in the process.

My point being that we should not use Pixels, but rather hint to vector how to keep things ordered in low res system. (like font hinting)

Most people (artist or programmers) should not need to be thinking about this almost ever. The tools should hide this from you unless there is a good reason for you to be messing with it.

Just like any Maths library.

I will add into this list of issues clockwise and counterclockwise issues with vector rendering. This too causes bugs. So Figma (popular design and layout tool) fails to save SVG images correctly about half the time.

Warning, &lt;rant&gt;

I 'feel' like we have this HUGE problem, like a building method that keeps producing confusing building layouts, that eventually always falls down, because they are made like any house.

And houses sound great when described: a foundation, a floor, walls, roof, etc.

But actually, almost every house out there is built wrong. For one thing, they are built bottom up. And you CAN build houses that last a long time this way. And perhaps even several stories tall. But philosophically, it is still just sticks and mud, and very difficult to change things later.

About 100 years ago we sort of 'comprehended' a completely better way to make buildings. Instead of bottom up, top down.

In fact, what you do is build a cage, and then 'hang' the walls from the cage. This simple but subtle concept literally changed everything.

Now one could build 'spaces' that change all the time, even right now to the plumbing if you follow just a few rules.

Let me drill into this a little more (if you will permit me). A few of you even in here have been to one or more of the houses I've built or redesigned, and know I make a really nice 'space.' But, my next house I will build from scratch, using the techniques of skyscrapers.

It means pushing the 'strength' to the corners, and all walls suddenly are no longer load-bearing, and can be moved and changed whenever you like. Worth EVERY penny.

Let me take this even deeper to make a subtle point. I helped a friend of mine fix his house in the bay area. For the past 20 years he has left a single wall in the middle of his house UNFINISHED (much like his code, he is a leading researcher of AI at PARC). As a gift, I finished it for him. But he fought me at first. He was caught up on using nails or screws., and what was legal. Being a weekend warrior of sorts as he was, he drew bad conclusions from forums.

It was a common pattern. The 'old experts' would attack the young new contractors, and tell them all sorts of reasons something could not be done. One was 'using screws on a shear wall'

And they would be right, if the screws were the ones from when they were young (the 70s), which were made of pure shit. But today they make amazing screws just for shear walls. His next point was that they said these were expensive.

He is right... if you were doing a whole house of them! But not for one wall, where our conversation was costing more than the box of screws.

I built him an earthquake shear wall that is so damned good it WILL be the only thing standing 100 years from now.

(side note, when I was done, I also mastered the style of the 60's stucco artist that did all his walls. Literally practice for a day until I could reproduce exactly the way the original person did the house, and then proceeded to texture the space so well you would never know any work had ever been done. And, someone in this group was my assistant on that :) so they got to see how I do this stuff)

Ok, now back to APIs. The whole API concept is wrong! But just like houses are wrong. Sure, they are 'good enough' perhaps. But it is no longer worth it to build that way ... stick and mud.

So his video was solving problems (from my POV) which are problems on top of other problems.

Respectech

[15:49](#msg62335875161ffc40d7bd0bb4)@BaronRK I am also interested. Both in building houses and what to use in place of APIs.

BaronRK

[15:49](#msg623358898db2b95f0a706a33)It is not 'instead of' per se (but indeed, it might appear that way.

Rather (and first) I consider ALL interfaces between any two computers to be an API (literally).

So, WebDAV, POP3, HTTP, FTP, blah blah blah.... these are all 'API's

In fact, WebDAV and IMAP really should be the EXACT same API.

The question we should all ask is, 'why do we need to custom cut every 2x4?' (48x98 mm)

What percentage of every single house is using the exact same 'intended' parts?

(I say intended, because every single 2x4 will be 'slightly' different for each wall, custom cut, but the goal is to just have an exact size)

I view almost all of what any API as doing as falling into the following basic groups:

\- ID (you, the account, a project, rights, SSO, etc.)  
\- List management  
\- Object management

So, why aren't all API calls basically just CRED (Security is implied)

Create( Event, In\_Project, Template)  
Read  
Edit  
Delete

If you don't know what fields to fill in for the template, you can ask for the template

Read( 'Event', In\_Project, Template)

We need just one more simple trick to make all this really easy:

An agreed upon list of variable names

If my template had a variable for 'Name'

We can all agree a file has a Name.  
A task or event on a cal has a Name (even if it is the summary of it.  
A Wiki has a Name.  
You have a Name.

The goal here is to find ways to treat all things the SAME. Because most of the time, that is what we do.

Editing the name of things should be the same code regardless of the object.

Summed up, this is all about just setting up some basic rules, and protocols.

NOTHING here would stop you from doing custom crap (which is currently the default for everything).

Rather, it would mean copy and pasting code to do obvious things.

On APIs, Bertrand Meyer, designer of the Eiffel language, makes this point in his book `Reusable Software`, where he talks about things in terms of Linnaean classification for data structures. e.g. in many langs, stack have `push/pop`, queues have `enqueue/dequeue`, etc., but all 1D data structures can use the same name for these operations. We know this in Red because of the `series!` datatype. You can still add more control when needed, but being able to use the same interface for many things means a lot less cognitive load.

[06:21](#msg623424cf0466b352a423f10d)I'll answer your question, but, permit me to tell you a quick story.

That morning, about 15 minutes after the first plane hit, I received a call from the top reporters at the Washington Post. They wanted me to estimate the damage ASAP.

Why were they calling me? Yeah, normally that might seem strange, but two things:

1\. I was the original architect of the WashingtonPost.com (called DigitalInk at the time).

2\. I do forensics on high profile cases (mostly lawsuits).

At that moment they were estimating tens of thousands. The best I could come up with after taking into account how many stories, and how filled the building would be before noon was 5-10x less than the number they were CONVINCED of.

The Twin towers are 110 stories tall. If they had been made the traditional way (which would have meant a mass of ............................... wood), it would have created the most amazing fire which would have been both burned far stronger, and far longer (keep in mind, as it stood, the fires burned for almost 3 months).

My 3-5x might be low in terms of the damage it would have done to the air, and surrounding buildings with a fire burning much bigger and stronger for months.

That all said, I have been involved helping several teams with stats both during and after the event. I lost several friends, and dozens of people I worked within those buildings.

While on this topic, a quick subtle example of something - America stopped all research on Cell phones and cancer. You might recall all the data came from Sweden and other Nordic countries. Why did America stop? The entire research team minus one were in the first building that morning. I know that one also.

[17:58](#msg6234c85309092523182ed3f8)An interesting note regarding Reichart's preferred building style (and one of which I'm also fond). In Medieval Europe, buildings were primarily made using timberframe construction. This is similar to post-and-beam which is used in most extremely large buildings today, but it generally didn't use any metal fasteners as they were expensive and hard to make. The wood joinery was designed such that the forces acting on the building would tighten the joints instead of putting stress on them. Many of these buildings are still standing today. (Side note: @BaronRK I am in the beginning phases of designing a Medieval-style timberframe to go on some semi-remote mountain land we've owned in Montana for 30 years - hit me up if you're interested in collaborating.)

But then "modern" house building methods were developed after the Industrial Revolution. "Stick-frame" is relatively fast and inexpensive to build, but has a lower lifespan than timberframe, and is not as durable.

Modern concrete construction is a sham. Ever since rebar has been a requirement in concrete construction and mild steel has been used as rebar in concrete, many (or most of) these structures have a lifespan of well under 100 years. Concrete absorbs moisture, moisture rusts mild steel which then expands, causing the concrete to crack and fail. That's the main reason the condo in Florida collapsed recently, exacerbated by the salt air. There is no practical way to remediate a building built in this manner. Personally, I'm surprised that this building style hasn't been outlawed, or at least the major issues addressed. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-long-does-modern-concrete-building-last-amit-enterprises-housing

An interesting and extremely low-tech housing construction method I've studied for about 30 years, and that has stood the test of time for centuries is strawbale. When properly constructed and enveloped, strawbale construction is inexpensive, environmentally-friendly, quick, load-bearing (2 stories or less), durable, and energy efficient. It can also be combined with other methods such as timberframe or post-and-beam to create a hybrid solution.

BaronRK

[15:36](#msg6239ed060466b352a42edc74)And, a very different way of thinking of this:

I created a language called MIDAS (which made GOLD files of course). This was close to 30 years ago. It sounds like a Baccronym, but funny enough, the purpose of the language was created first 'Machine Independent + Demo and Animation System' - That was the literal goal. To get basic demos with animation up and running on many computers at the same time.

I worked backwards from the goals:

\- Write once  
\- PCode output  
\- A few dozen commands is enough to do most things (thus all commands fit in 1 byte)  
\- Run on C64, Apple II, Amiga, Mac, PC, etc.

After running many tests, and discussing the architecture with a friend that wrote Lattice C, I realised that for the most part, a compiler comes down to very simple structure parsing, but ultimately you want to get all conditional loops down to DO and WHILE. This is really important from the POV of getting things fast on 1Mhz computers.

Since personally, I'm a crappy programmer with good tricks, I only really program in Machine Language (6502, Z80, 8086, 68000) and LISP. So either very low, or very high.

Unlike 'beautiful' languages, I did not care about all that. I needed Program Flow, not a language that did everything. In fact, for the most part I wanted this language to embody ANYTHING that COULD be expressed across machines.

A command like IMAGE() would display an image from a buffer, or point to the buffer, etc.  
Thus, the code for that would have to be custom written on each platform.  
I promise you, your not going to write the same code for a C64 screen and a PC screen.  
So... move up higher to just image() (like a library call), and then custom write it in ASM on each.

But, it proved to be magical!

After just a set of 20+ commands, we could write simple programs, that did complex things INSTANTLY on all these platforms.

As far as basic structure we used C of course Do() {...} While() {...}

Lots of OnInput(Button1) etc.  
Where Button1 could be a joystick, mouse, or spacebar, etc.

We had rather complex full (complete) programs that were 1K.  
A print command would literally be 1 byte for the command, 1 byte worth of length (no need for EOF, but also built-in counter), so only 256 length strings of course. But again, super simple.

But now when demonstrating to publishers how fast we could get games up and running, think about what our demo looked like compared to everyone elses.

@pekr Pekr, in psichology these behaviours are know: you are blocked by something, then you make an announcement to you are going to take action, then this phase ends and you are again blocked. Another reason could be: he announces "I will make it open source" because of our pressure but he is still not ready inside and won't release anything. Nobody knows but himself. I respect him for all the gift he has given to us and pray he would go beyond these chains (that have also blocked myself in the past times and sometime even now).

Summed up, less shit to write, easier to look at. Winner!

Small note, I will toot my own horn here, I prefer Carls MakeDoc over MarkDown, but I prefer my own QML (Qtask Markup Language) over both them.

Proof:

=H1 Overview  
\=b this text would be bold =. but this text is not because I just turned bold off with that equal + .  
Or you could have =i had this in italics, and this in =b bold =b. and then pick up in italics and then turn it off with -.

[07:28](#msg628743284aa6c31dca0ee1e2)I must say that I prefer MakeDoc/MarkDown over QML because they give you a visual clue. This \\\*bold\\* and this is /italic/ is self explainable, unlike this is =b bold= and this is =i italic=. But I guess it’s a matter of prefference.

BaronRK

[08:38](#msg628753684aa6c31dca0f0180)You need a visual cue greater than =B ?  
Try doing a table in Markdown, or MakeDoc.

Bullets in QML:

=\\* One  
\=\\* Two  
\=\\* Three

The GOAL is to make the document LOOL like the final output.  
But you may have forgotten, for people like you (PITAs) QML allowed for one to CHANGE the bloody markup itself to look like all the other shitty ones LOL

[20:27](#msg6287f99e4e38f759e27da653)I can also confirm that @BaronRK thinks highly of you @rebolek. He and I have both failed to find something I wrote about working with him, so I'll have to think on it again, thanks to your spark. :^)

\---

It's tricky because if you take anything he says seriously \*to* you that is \*about* you, in a normal conversation, you may be offended. As he has said himself "People feel important when they're offended, and I try to make people feel important." So never take him seriously...except... Except when it's not just chat that may lead to insights and connections and sharing information (like here), but \*real* one-on-one dialogue. (language and culture can get in the way too, for me, so I may only make matter worse here; he can clarify as needed)

Real dialogue with Reichart isn't warm and fuzzy feel-good let's-hug-and-talk-it-out. It's a disinterested (but NOT \*uninterested\*) accounting of facts that, if considered objectively (no matter how personal in nature they may seem), lead to an inevitable semblance of agreement and understanding.

It ends up being fun, because interacting with him is different than doing so with almost anyone else. If it's not fun, you're doing it wrong. Once you "get it", which I admit I didn't for quite a while (we got along great from day one, but I didn't \*get it* by a long stretch), it's very relaxing, because you \*never* have to censor yourself, be on guard, worry about him getting upset, or being wrong. That doesn't mean you \*aren't* wrong, and he'll tell you so, but that leads to learning so it's a win all around. You just have to not take anything personally...except...except when he's trying to help you as a person, like an AI that analyzes you and works as a feedback mechanism.

For example, if he says "Let's have a call.", I video call and say "Hey, nice to see you.", and he responds "You're being an asshole." It's not a personal attack, just him being efficient, saying it objectively, and setting a context for the conversation. He could say "I'd like to talk to you about how you're treating your team and community." but it sets a very different tone, seeming less important. Mind you, he's not going to use strong language like that unless I really am off the rails and he needs to get my attention about it because it's affecting other people.

His goal is to fix problems. Make things better. I know this now. But maybe I fire back with "No \*you're* an asshole, asshole!". Now that's a personal attack, and an emotional response. To which he might calmly say "I didn't say you \*were* an asshole, I said you were \*being* one. Do you want to know why?" One is something you can fix pretty easily, the other not so much. And it goes both ways. If I tell him he's being an A-hole (I have to be really fired up to use the whole word), he'll lightheartedly say "What? Again? @#$%!" then seriously ask for the facts and issue any necessary apologies. \*Real* A-holes never apologize.

Reichart isn't an asshole (objective use here, so the whole word is OK). It's an easy mistake to make, though, since he may look like one if you don't realize his face is just all puckered up because dealing with the rest of us is so painful for him. :^)*

\* The smiley is there for everyone \*except* Reichart.

[20:11](#msg629a6b09d126691416cc91dd)Finding a technical solution, that brings literate programming to wide use is a great goal. In the case of `help`, the historical goal has been "keep it short, because it's for console use and the content is in the code itself." There's no reason it can't be done with new approaches, but a fundamental issue has been the use of plain text files that don't require special tooling. That's great for many reasons, but limiting. What I hope we can do is find organizational systems for content (code, docs, tests, training, and more) that let us tie together long-lived content (e.g. plain text), with tools that make the whole richer. It sounds easy, and really shouldn't be that hard.

It ties into other projects in my sphere, a big one being something I call `funcology`, and things like my dict-doc experiment.

[22:30](#msg629e7feeef00bd1dc61ac4f0)Here it my UltraEdit Enviromnent

[22:30](#msg629e800fe393a31806447c78)On the right you will find a list of functions I have manually grouped moving them inside the source.

[22:32](#msg629e8073e393a31806447d1c)Also I have used some tricks to have group names and divisors like creating fake function like:  
`---EXTRACTORS: does []`

[22:33](#msg629e80bed126691416d4301f)This is a huge big file I divide using a script to create all functions as single files.

[22:35](#msg629e811bdeea5616bbe53e3c)To avoid this, I want to list all files like the list on the right, and then, when I click over one, it is LOADED in the editor, and then asked for saving when I click onto another

[22:35](#msg629e8142da330517ffb2f65f)This list must be manually grouped when I can put divisors.

[22:37](#msg629e81a7da330517ffb2f6e1)I can actually simulate this working using the current list component of RED, and it will be better when `table-style`will be ready.

[22:38](#msg629e81e867db9a59db0807f6)But the only thing that is actually impossible to have, is Syntax-Highlighting inside the RED Text Area Editor.

[22:39](#msg629e8222e393a318064480e8)This is what I need and the reason why I have asked for an existing editor with Red dictionary and a customizable list.

[22:42](#msg629e82d5c9382316a6407f5c)@greggirwin  
&gt; ... I say possible because it works fine for something like Notepad where every file is in a new instance, but you want something that just adds a new file tab to an existing session. It's a good note for @toomasv, as he's done a basic notepad, and we should support extensions and use cases like this....

I do not want to open another file tab, I need to load te selected one in the current pane/area without any prompt.

[23:16](#msg629e8adae393a31806449274)This is the actual environment I have created in Rebol to experiment with the idea. The missing syntaxt highlighting makes me prefeer using UltraEdit.

[23:20](#msg629e8bc6f8daa71e07b85985)I use it just for rapid function browsing in directories (upper part) and selected scripts (lower part), and also to browse online resources.

greggirwin

[23:51](#msg629e92eec61b987d33e72b1b)Cool. This should be possible with something like my old SendKeys dialect. i.e. your dir pane is a Red app, which finds the UE window, docks to it, and pumps it keystrokes like a ghost user.

## Tuesday 7th June, 2022

GiuseppeChillemi

[00:04](#msg629e95fce393a3180644a6c4)Yes, it is one of the ideas. The other is to find a ready made editor component and integrate it as style in Red, like the other widgets that have been implemented.

hiiamboris

[11:56](#msg629f3d00c9382316a641e816)@BaronRK Btw, matrix integration is currently a valuable feature. Because by dividing and conquering we're not making the world any better for anyone. Well, maybe more a political feature atm than practical (until we make or see a good native matrix client). Unless you aim this chat system to be closed and tightly controlled ofc.

Here's also an idea one fellow shared to me: AI moderation. Is this user shitposting or is actually interesting to read for the others? It's more for open chat systems, where communities sprawl at random, than for work teams.

One word about defense too. In matrix it is currently possible to destroy about any room by sending a few millions of messages into it (will take days to sync them lol). Again, concern of open systems.

toomasv

[13:24](#msg629f51a8deea5616bbe6d13e)@GiuseppeChillemi Something \[like this](https://github.com/toomasv/editor/blob/master/giuseppe.red), except syntax highlighting? Very basic, allows to organize files in list (drag around or use menu, add separators, remove items) and save/reuse the list (saved in current dir as `%dir-scripts.red`, may be edited manually). Resize, change sizes of list and content-area by dragging on separator bar, change font size by ctrl-wheeling. Just thrown together, not much tested, be careful not to overwrite your files.

GiuseppeChillemi

[14:00](#msg629f5a0bd126691416d5ccd2)Yes, this with syntax highlighting and opening the file at position to allow restarting the editing from a precise point, or searching for a function inside a file and opening it at the function's position.

[07:20](#msg62d8fe2fb408e830dc294cdb)@abdllhygt I'm looking forward to seeing you dictionary app! The choice of data structures is one of the most important questions in software development.  
Will your dictionary be two-way (for example Turkish -&gt; English and English -&gt; Turkish)? Most probably each word will have several possible translations in the target language - how will you separate them in an array (list, block)?  
Many years ago I created a small program (in plain C) to help me practice the new English words I've been encountering. It has a simple CRUD functionality - to Create a word (add an English word to my dictionary along with several Bulgarian words (phrases) with could be transleted to), Read a word (show the translations), Update (edit the word or update the translations) and Delete. The most useful feauture was the "Exam" mode, in which the program was testing my knowledge - it asked me to translate from English to Bulgarian or from Bulgarian to English, keeping track of the words I have mistaken and showing them in the next sessions.  
It was called Lexam (Lexical EXAM) :).  
It took me many hours to code it and to tune the Windows messaging loop. I'm sure I can now write it in Red in a small fraction of that time.

[18:17](#msg62e2d2bdab6b634f73a39304)Strange little question

I once heard a German use a word 'wasserkontakt' in a strange way, to mean 'you need to jiggle it to make it work.'

This is not what it normally means (it just means to contact with water).

Does anyone know (in any language) a word that carries this meaning.

Like when you have to jiggle the handle of a toilet to make it stop running.

It is such a wonderful concept, so to have a single word (in any language) would be so useful to have.

It‘s a contact that isn‘t fastened enough to be reliable, to make it work you‘ll have to fasten it.

So there is a nasty core philosophical bug across OSs. (DOS)

Summed up: Linux (Mac) is case sensitive, and Windows is not.

So you can have a file called R.red and r.red on your Linux machine, but when you sync with Windows, what should Windows do here since it will see these as the same file?

//#LowestCommonDenominator

DropBox, Git, ODrive, GoogleDrive all have to be dealing with this.

My best solution is:

1\. A Linux user uploads these two files to a repository  
2\. When a Windows person DL the two files, one of the files will be renamed as 'r (1).red' (This is what Windows and Google Drive do by default).  
3\. If synced from Windows, then... the respository will now have 3 files: R.red, r.red, and r (1).red.  
4\. The person that creates this problem (Linus or Mac user) is the one that needs to fix this.

greggirwin

[15:46](#msg632b31e8f4d7a323dee3a2eb)@riprwwa same as for case sensitive languages, it's faster and easier for machines to process, and means many more "slots" can be used (hence many more possible names for a given number of letters), at the expense of how humans think. Case insensitivity does mean you have to come up with different names, but if only the case is different, that doesn't tell you anything anyway. So it's good for computers, but bad UI IMO. They are good at things we are not.

&gt; If synced from Windows, then... the respository will now have 3 files: R.red, r.red, and r (1).red.

This doesn't sound right @BaronRK. Windows can't have both %R.red and %r.red at the same time, so there will only be 2 files, or `[%r.red %r (1).red %r (2).red]`.

If you \*have to* download the files, rather than \*only* warning the user and making them fix it first, it has to be some kind of convention. To @pekr's point, you can't know if the file is numbered because of case naming, or because it's a straight copy (or an historical one), which Windows also does. i.e. anytime there's a conflict. It often adds `copy` in the name, which helps there.

Has anyone added tooling to say files are exactly the same, N% the same, or add a metadata tag that a file was originally copied from another? AFAIK, only exact matches have been done, though some specialized software might do it.

[15:10](#msg63306f5f458f823ce09d902e)Gregg, locally there could be 3. and prob wiser to grab whatever one finds on server and sync 100%.  
Better to overdo it basically.

I don't see a reason why loops would cause lots of files to be created. But that is partially why we do &lt;name&gt;(n)

This SEEMS to be the way everyone else is solving this as well, so I'm going with it.  
It's just a shitty shame of MS.

All of this would be solved if the file system was my architecture which is a DB of hashed files (or even blocks) and the naming is tag based (not folder/file based) allowing for all possibilities.

Then you are free to have any filing naming system you want for anything at any level.

But 2022, we need to wait another 50-100 years for everyone to work it out.

greggirwin

[19:42](#msg6330af109d3c1862991b8de5)It's not simply lower vs upper case. It's combinations (`[a A] [ab Ab aB AB] [abc Abc aBc abC ABc AbC abC ...]`), renaming over time, content changes, and how you present it to humans on incompatible systems.

I don't think MS is wrong here, or are case sensitive file systems. Just different. I personally \*prefer* case insensitive names, and avoid case sensitive names even when I \*can* use them because it makes me add explicit, meaningful content to the name. The extra names case senstivity makes available is more than a human could deal with anyway, so what's the \*real* value, from a human perspective, of case sensitive naming?

PickOS and MUMPs both used DBs as their FS, but there was still a uniqueness requirement, because you need to address a specific file without knowing its content. You can give a human options to pick from, and they look at each, but programmatic access needs to be deterministic.

By using a convention of `(n)` we also just make another tradeoff. Those would be valid names a user could use themselves, but now they can't because it conflicts with our convention and changes the meaning, conflating casing implicitly. That affects users on both systems.

My program needs to access `%r.txt`. How does my \*code* do that without a unique name? There are scenarios where you don't care. What you care about is the content. e.g. SQL can query for you and returns sets of results. But there is also, \*always* something that makes it unique, whether it's a key or a position in a list.

Then, a Windows person that doesn't care about case DLs thse and what do they end up with?

That is a choice for them.  
By default it would be r.txt and r(1).txt  
But they could also ask to 'act like' Linux for a give folder, or an entire volume.

That way the exact same code can run on any platform.

But, Windows already does something 'similar' with type files that 'appear' to have the same name.

By default, Windows 8, 10,11, don't show extensions. So you can have two files R and R but in fact one is R.txt the other is R.mov.

But they do APPEAR to the user as the same name. How is this any different that what I'm suggesting?  
I'm hiding the Hash though.

Ultimately Windows is wrong to ignore case.  
All I'm saying is, they are welcome to keep pretending case does not matter in my system.  
but there are going to be times when they need to pop up a requester to ask them how they want to handle something.  
They can add that to the long list of stupid things they ask users because of their defaults.

I still don't understand why Notepad makes me save data, and worse, if I manually hit save, it MAKES me give it a name.

Apple built a whole company simply doing what MS does, but the opposite.

Imagine how simple life will be when we can have completely eight different programming languages named red through RED, each with potentially over 1000 websites in the range www.red-lang.org to WWW.RED-LANG.ORG.

I mean, that's why case evolved in the middle ages, isn't it!?

And surely it is time to bring back lowercase numbers (they do exist), add some flexibility to finance and math?

Or maybe it was a mistake to start using case as a distinguisher..... :)

Nope. It could only run on any platform \*using the new system* (back to XKCD on standards).

I disagree. It's simply a design choice.

And now...let's add \*case preserving* to the mix.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case\_sensitivity#In\_filesystems

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/case-sensitivity (here is your answer to how your file sharing system could work @BaronRK, by forcing synced folders to use case sensitivity on Windows. Just be prepared for confused users and some software to mess up filenames.)

Does this new feature mean MS has seen the error of their ways? I don't think so. I think it means WSL and mixed-environment uses for devs and servers are important to fight Linux for market share and make it easy for them to use Windows with minimal risk.

[18:32](#msg6334932c647d633cf641d2d8)I'm all for tags, and involving users when necessary, to improve usability. But as data moves around, pulling the wrong data from a file when a user isn't involved terrifies me.

&gt; So you can have two files R and R but in fact one is R.txt the other is R.mov. But they do APPEAR to the user as the same name. How is this any different that what I'm suggesting?

For users, sure, and extra info is added to help, right? e.g. icons for associated programs by extension. But it's different for a program, which can't say `load %r` and not know which file it will get. The extension makes the names unique, and adds meaning. Here we \*can* use tags in places of names, absolutely. All we have to do is say `load/options files/tagged [%r "text" [loadable Red]] ...` where `options` could be `require-unique` or `all`.

[18:37](#msg63349479aa091774292ffcc3)I will say that the case preserving aspect, and knowing that we may need to account for it in Windows now, is \*very* timely and @qtxie and @dockimbel will want to consider it when work resumes on IO. Now is the time to get that right, because it's the future.

'It could only run on any platform using the new system (back to XKCD on standards).'

I'm already saying the solution is Windows has to be updated. But so do all OSs.

'I disagree. It's simply a design choice.'

And I'll counter it is elitist to treat ASCII characters as 'the same' in all cases and cases (yes, both uses of the word).

A simple and real example: Apple.txt the company, apple.txt the fruit. It is a 'design choice' that causes other problems.

We have words for this: Capitonyms, Bicapitalization, InterCaps, etc.

But is also applies to words like eBay, or real names such FitzGerald, McDonald, MacIntyre. There is value in being able to write them both ways.

So, sure it was a 'choice' by MS, but it carries deeper implications. Given it is 2022, I vote we make this about being 'WOKE' and if we were posting this all more publically I'm sure someone would make the argument that MS is being racist LOL

'Just be prepared for confused users and some software to mess up filenames.'

Right! We ALREADY have this problem, this is the point I'm making in the first place. And, if we already have this problem, let's fix it once and for all going forward. My solution has been presented. It does not make it worse than it is now, it solves that. I'm offering the solve that solves MS, and the deeper issue as well.

By doing it as I suggest, we don't add NEW problems, the problem is already there, I'm just solving the root of the problem so that it CAN do what is needed.

Caps is a great way to solve not having BOLD too :)

The way IBM mainframe operating systems handle this is by making it possible to (almost!) seamlessly access files from any mounted file system.

So mainframe-native data sets (case insensitive names; stored in catalogs, not folders; probably EBCDIC content, not ASCII) are in one set of file systems while UNIX files are in others.

Imagine that as as single tag on an open statement. (DSNAME for native, PATH for UNIX, if you really want to know the actual keywords).

And, if the UNIX file system is mounted remotely, there is no need to explicitly upload its files at all (@baronRK’s starting scenario).

Where the Tag itself has a label, and deeper data.

But there exists a few people who hold integrity in higher regard than the lust for limitless power and wealth, and if their values are in the right place for the betterment of all humanity, they would "theoretically" be better than any other political system which as you say are run by "top gangs" (again, I agree with you on this).

For those promoting democracy as the best practical system, keep in mind that Russia states they have a federal democratic system. If you believe that, then I suggest you re-read @hiiamboris 's post.

Simple, but POWERFUL!

Recently I've started breaking down bugs into classifications of what we might have done to avoid the bug.

The top three come up the most, and in order:

\* StateMachine - Path to success vs path to failure.  
\* SetScope - Values that should not be allowed.  
\* Typos - Again revealed by path to success or path to failure.  
\* ZenosParadox - Stopping for no fucking good reason halfway across the room.  
\* Off By One error - (possible)  
\* Yogurt - does it start up from scratch?  
\* Version compatibility - backwards and forwards.

hiiamboris

[08:45](#msg63452d16133b6458ca1fe506)About 90% of bugs I'm fixing in my own code come from the fact that I'm making hundreds of decisions but I can't possibly see all their implications (not even a half) on the future model of the code, because it is the unknown, and the whole coding process can be seen as a search for that ultimate final model.

[08:54](#msg63452f2ccb3b2435280ddd7d)Other reasons are if I drop from my cache how some part works, and do not consider it. Especially during refactoring. Or if I refactor something, changing the parts I remember, but miss some other parts. Then some typos, agreed (e.g. forgetting to pass an argument). Control over allowed values helps detect these bugs earlier, but does not avoid them. State machines would not help at all. Versioning is unrelated. Not sure what your other points mean in the context "what we might have done".

BaronRK

[13:28](#msg63456f7e9a0ad66a76039fc4)How many programmers who's code I have tracked for 35 years, down to each exact bug or feature do you think I need to get a reasonable statistic?

hiiamboris

[15:03](#msg634585bfcb3b2435280e86a2)Well, I see strong bias in your conclusions, but can't tell where it comes from. Do you have any stats for my bugs for aztools? I didn't even report many of them, and it would be an unreasonably big effort to do paperwork on all the bugs. So maybe your choice of what to track is biased.

Take big systems, like Red, or even Prolific (as a whole). Could you or anyone have designed a state machine to describe the whole system before it's implemented and tried out? No way. Only after you get to know your system better, you can say "here's what I don't like" and "here's a bug". Then you could perhaps post factum describe it's behavior using a state machine, but it would only make sense as a broad description, or for mostly isolated parts, because state of the whole system would be way too complex for a human's comprehension.

Even then the key question is is it worth describing? It's quite an effort after all. I guess in your case, in a team that would help synchronize the knowledge about the system between team members, so to a certain depth it's worth it, at least for the parts that need to be understood by more than one person.

[15:48](#msg6345905aa72aed01662a6407)"Unavoidable bugs" - (so long ago that I can't find any reference to it online), IBM used to talk about the 5000 year bug. That's a bug that would take your team 5000 years of continuous testing to find.  
And it doesn't matter how big your QA team is - for every team size there is always at least one 5000-year bug.  
But , when you launch your product and there are a million downloads a day, some poor user is going to hit that bug in the first 48 hours.  
Moral of story (as they used to tell it): you can't assume code is ever bug free; so you must design to be resilient and recoverable in the face of unknown bugs.

BaronRK

[17:29](#msg6345a7fb9a0ad66a76040a02)You 'might' be reading too much into everything.

It's simple, I've tracked more bugs and features than anyone you know. I'l stand on that statement. Do you have any better examples?

not just our own software, remember, we track entire systems for other companies as well. Software, Hardware, Device and product dev, etc.

Literally, hundreds of thousands of tasks across different projects each described and discussed and reduced to their cost in time, and problems. People like to think they know, but we have hard data. We know for example that our bug ratio is always under 10%, often less than 5%. Our counter parts on similar projects, have bug ratios inverted at 200%! Meaning, for every feature, there are 2 blody bugs! Insane.

When you say 'biased' - to what? It's just data. If anything, you thinking you know the nature of your own bugs, or your friend's, is biased to your assumption you can remember what is what, and selective memory, and every other bias humans have. I simply tag things with words like #StateMachine after a programmer tells me 'yeah, ultimately the bug was a State Machine bug.' If we had a system in place that tracked the state in simple terms, the bug would not have happened. not much more to it.

And let me be a little harsher here. Truly compare this. Have you ever shiped a product without obvious bugs?  
\[truly, asking]

I have, many times. Try making a video game that gets burned into a cartridge, or software that gets released and can't be updated. Or software that runs in Slot machines, for years, never turning off or being reset. Again, I have. I've architected and built product that ship literally 100s of thousands of unites each week, nonstop. Bugs? We don't need to stink'n bugs! LOL

Today, almost no one ships bug-free software. And software has become slow, bloated, and compartmentalized to try to avoid bugs.

You may not like the way I push you here, but I'll come to the table with data, where is yours?

hiiamboris

[17:57](#msg6345ae8d2a06f4566b301804)LOL no, no table coming, as I'm totally not wasting my time on it, so you'll just have to take my word for my stats. \*Have I ever?* Yes. It's just a matter of personal QA level and familiarity with the problem.

I understood that tag in the context of "what we could have done to prevent the bug" as "we could draw and analyze state charts". Misunderstood?

For a solid counter-example - take Red \[issue tracker](https://github.com/red/red/issues?q=is%3Aissue). It has quite a lot of bugs missing - those that appear on early development stages, but otherwise may serve as an example where state charts would mostly waste more time that they could save. Again, mostly - but not always. And on this stage of development, not on pre-release QA, where priorities may shift, and we'll be talking not about any bugs, but post-production bugs.

I think you answered my question though. Websites and some games are often easy to look at as state machines, and as a result you might be dealing with state machines much more often, which explains the data. You could of course say that every program is a state machine and thus 100% of bugs can be labeled with that tag, but then the tag would be of zero value :)

\[I'm going to keep being harsh with you here, because you keep waving your hand]

So, what are these programs I'm not accounting for that don't have State Machines as their number 1 form of bug?

Let's review again 'things I've made' (let alone tracked for others):

\- 8 bit, 16 bit, and 32 bit games  
\- Original game machines (do keep in mind, I helped make the Sony PlayStation, and the first Set box in history C= CDTV, also the Dreamcast, X32, etc.)  
\- Dozens of Slot Machines, including being the first person in history to design a slot machine built on Windows! And it never crashed.  
\- We also were the team that built Media Edition for Windows, literally, they brought us in to fix their bugs.  
\- Media tools - literally tools for manipulator dozens of formats, video, compression... and, no bugs.  
\- Firmware for dozens of hardware devices (again, not allowed to crash).  
\- Libraries, APIS and frameworks for dozens of companies.  
\- AI for military  
\- Black box AI for massive multiplayer video games  
\- blah  
\- blah  
\- blah

But you're just going to wave your hand again right?  
More importantly, what ratio of all products do they represent?

No examples, no data, no proof. just 'yeah, but....'

&gt; State machines would not help at all.

You're hypothesizing Boris.

We all have our own experiences as limitations on what we know and can use. Ki's experience is deep and wide. I don't know what other projects you've worked on, which would be good to share so we can find common ground and perhaps see why our views differ. You may recall that Prolific is \*all about* tracking tasks, and learning from that data is an important aspect. And that's only the last 15 years of him doing it in full view. I'll appeal to another authority here, Pieter Hintjens. In particular, iMatix's Libero code generator. But much of his work was about collaboration, which is facilitated by design. I don't care \*who* has the best stats, I just want them.

You noted Red as an example of something that couldn't be done by designing the SM (State Machine) first. `Parse` is, itself, implemented as an FSM, correct? And while it isn't bug free, it's one of the most powerful elements in Red, complex, and quite robust. Are there other areas in Red that \*could* have used an FSM as part of their core design, even if only to inform the implementation? I think so. Do we want to do that at a granular level all the way down? I don't think so, but that's from my experience of not having great FSM or other tools that make it easy and natural. If you started someone out that way, it might seem perfectly normal to them, and then we can see what produces better results.

&gt; Even then the key question is is it worth describing?

When work on the new roadmap begins, should we build things like the current codebase was done, or do you think that there might be a better way? You've learned a lot about the deep core of Red, but it was a huge amount of work, right? How can we make it easier for others to contribute effectively in the future? Helping them understand the design seems important. It won't happen by accident. It has to be a goal and a task.

So the answer to your question should always be `Yes`. But we're mostly of a generation that flies by the seat of our pants; and largely gets away with it. We can say "I couldn't have written so much code or built so much if I had to stop and design things first." or "I'm doing exploratory development, so the design would just be wasted when I reach a point where something unforseen comes up." I know I'm guilty of that. Far more than I care to admit. And there \*are* two sides to things, because a state machine isn't the right tool to help design a dialect...or is it? Again, we don't know. DiaGrammar was a first step down that path. But maybe, just maybe, design time would have paid for itself and then some.

We do need tools to make sure design is \*perceived* to add value for programmers. Because even if it truly adds value, and I think it does, we prefer to write code all by ourselves and keep design aspects floating around in our heads. How is that working out? All our caches fail at some point, unless you live an unbalanced life to keep it filled. I've done that too. I've also played with FSM implementations that seemed huge compared to just writing simple code, so I'd go with code. But there's a big difference in that code shows you \*how* it's doing something, not \*what* it's doing. Somewhere there's a balance.

I don't take this personally (that is very rare) I do have passion for my debates, not to be confused. I mention this because this exact topic is the core of my work, meaning, literally, I'm trying to fix this so programmers don't have so many bugs in the first place. I tease (perhaps torture) programmers, but ultimately, I want to set them free LOL

Petr - Exactly :)

'This thread went really bananas. Fuck Putin and imperialistic ruSSia, by the way.'

Skål !!! (I toast you with fermented bananas)

Boris - indeed, there is a strong difference between attacking the person (calling someone a victim = idiot) you don't see it that way?

For example, I genuinely appreciate the amazing talent here, and yours as well very much. We can disagree and debate and even be heated or passionate, and still not disparage anyone (although it can feel that way).

Small note about 'Ad hominem - this is often misunderstood. It does not mean you can't attack someone as an idiot. Rather, it means very specifically that you are saying their opinion or reasons on something are wrong BECAUSE they are an idiot.

I mention to point out, I think you are most impressive, and thus, also worth my time, and thus, more so, worth debating with to learn how we see things differently, including calling into question each step of any logic.

So, 'back on topic? ' - see, this is the topic to me. Ultimately I'm in this thread on crappy Gitter to discuss how to make RED better, and Gitter better, etc. Step one, get programmers to see the problem in the first place.

Lehman's laws - Yup, I ref that in the docs I wrote on this 15 years ago (I'm working on a Proj Management book as well)

Of note - when Carl and I would first talked about REBOL (actually back when it is was LAVA, and I was writing MIDAS (much like REBOL in some ways) we literally talked in terms of FSM. I decided I needed to write my own language in 1990 to faster dev products. It is one reason we did things in 90 days as opposed to the 1.2 years of most comp products.

Other Greg - Indeed, and just think about how many programmers on GitHub are writing the exact same crap over and over and over. Just kill me. All that talent, solving the same problems over and over.

A little abstract, but sharing this here for a few reasons.

In our project management system (just imagine if Google Cal, Drobox, Jira, and Notion had a baby) we have a bug where the Badges on the Chat service update with new messages ( a panel on the left, sort of like MS Teams), but the Chat thread itself does not update.

This is a State Machine bug! Either way. Something is not firing off, or checking the STATE!

And for one reason or another, does not matter, it should be thought of as a failed state, and it should have warned the programmer this could happen.

[08:29](#msg63467afbcbfe685c8824fc46)This brings up an important point.

How a programmer thinks of a bug, and how I believe a bug should be thought of, is not the same thing.

Programmers (myself included when I'm wearing that hat) tend to be literally, and task-oriented, and bottom up.

PopUpVideo 'If You Have One Eye On The Goal, You Only Have One Eye On The Path' LOL

I tend to first ask: what is the goal? Since we often get caught too caught up with the path we walk. Perhaps we should not be walking a given path in the first place.

So, my point is, if we had the infrastructure for a smart StateMachine in the first place, then little magical tools could be watching what you are doing, building a flowchart, and popping out conditions that should not be possible and telling you about them! #Dependanies

&gt; RED, shall we go through together and start tagging the posted bugs?

I don't have any questions personally anymore :) But if you wish, here's a \[random selection of 10 numbers](https://i.gyazo.com/372b97a211787a9964eda8df1bee8956.png). After removing pull requests, it leaves us with bugs \[https://github.com/red/red/issues/525 https://github.com/red/red/issues/2233 https://github.com/red/red/issues/5108 https://github.com/red/red/issues/4250 https://github.com/red/red/issues/2268 https://github.com/red/red/issues/1833] which all have fixes in public. You can tell us which ones could have been prevented from happening using your state machine ideas and tools, and what we could have done (realistically, not spending 5k years) to do that. Let's see if this statistic is applicable to projects like Red, maybe we'll learn a few things, tweak the monkey ;)

&gt; it means very specifically that you are saying their opinion or reasons on something are wrong BECAUSE they are an idiot.

Basically if I continue this thought, I will come to that pointing out someone's (any) mistake = calling him an idiot. Guess to what kind of society that culture will lead? ;)

I admit I may sound like an ass often. We all have different perceptions, and I've always approached my own from engineering perspective, so it may be vastly different. For example, in my circles pointing out someone's mistake is a \*duty* of one noticing it, a reason to thank for and grounds to work from :)

I'm being politically censored here, but may approach common radical opinions from another perspective. One's emotional background is like a lever sticking out. If one doesn't fully control that lever consciously, it's an opportunity and an invitation to use it, sent to whoever is capable. Literally as if one had a "please trick me, I want to receive an experience of being emotionally abused" label on his forehead. As a result, some bastard gets to control this human unit for his own dirty game. With massive enough means of communication in hand, the game becomes a world war (but that's just one application out of many). I'm only saying that because I care for people here. I don't want to see them being played like puppets.

[18:20](#msg6347056534982518bdf669e5)One of the problems with defining bugs is that you have to first know what the true expected behavior is. In a messy and ever-changing world, that true expected behavior may be ill-defined and subject to change over time.

Many years ago, I did some desigh work for a travel company who wanted to break into the exotic locations weddings market (eg they fly you to a sunset beach, and you take your vows while riding elephants).

Their brief requirements document said something like ("10% discount if at least one of the partners is under 21; 15% discount if at least one of them is over 65")

We immediately flooded them with questions - which I can sum up in this one question: "what is the discount if three 18 year olds are marrying three 70 year olds in a group marriage?"

Turns out they hadn't thought about "mixed age" partners or polyamorous marriages with more than two partners.

Which is a pity, because booking a fake marriage could have been a very cheap way for grandparents to take their grandkids on a luxury. vacation. But would allowing that have been a bug, given the initial vagueness of the spec?

greggirwin

[18:40](#msg63470a12fbade7016ebb9f7b)I agree with @dsunanda that the real issue is what is defined. We can say there isn't enough time to specify everything in detail, we lack information, etc. But that just shifts the behavior spec to "undefined". That leads to more and varied bugs, and wasted time.

To @riprwwa's question, I've never built an entire system this way, only parts of them. I think that's part of the answer. You don't try to define an entire system, top down, as an FSM. What you do is build \*parts* as FSMs (and other tools to increase reliability and predictability), and assemble those. So you can view a system process as a series of black boxes, then drill down into those to see their inner processes, down to the last turtle ("Turtles all the way down" reference).

[00:51](#msg6347611c64f29419bfd7148b)Various approaches apply. SMs by definition respond to events to change state or trigger actions, so an eventing system is needed. Actions based on events may send other events, which likely leads to a messaging queue of some kind. Now we're into channels, and one model that uses those is FRP (Functional Reactive Programming). Another is TBP (Flow-Based Programming). State has to be stored and perhaps distributed or persisted, feedback may be needed, along with backpressure mechanisms.

All that to say that state machines don't exist in a vacuum. Or, rather, in isolation. I imagine James Dyson and his team use them. :^)

Boris - Indeed, cool list, and YES, let's actually review a few together.

Sunanda - LOVE this example. Gab (and others on my team) decided to architect what we call a club code. We knew marketing would keep having us come up with discounts, etc. So I decided to just build a top-down system that could do ANYTHING. We did. We used this in multiple systems too, and should black box it and sell it to others. Summed up, Marketing can build a bunch of rules 'First 100 people to sign up get subscriptions free for 1 year' and we encode that like a Smart Contract, and it runs as a batch with everything else. Problem solved. Also, a giant state machine of course.

[11:52](#msg6347fbfd133b6458ca253561)@BaronRK Never underestimate the power of Marketing to dream up pricing schemes that break existing systems - and all known laws of logic.

I once spent three days in a basement with a couple of guys from SAP. SAP wanted a vacation pricing model so they could break into the industry.

The two guys started out with high confidence. Between them they had done pricing models for Crude Oil and Newsprint - said each was top of the range in terms of pricing complexity.

At the end of the three days, they were reduced to saying that SAP would be good on the backend - if our existing pricing model tells them the final price, they can produce the customer invoice.

The existing pricing model was really 50 years of tweaks to accommodate Marketing's latest pipe dream.

Typical Marketing request: please implement live by Friday: "If you book on any of the next 10 Thursdays for a flight departing between 02:00 and 11:45 on any of the next 20 weekends (except Xmas week), departing from (airport list); and your party size is less than 6 (not counting infants, but including juniors) and your return flight is within 8 to 15 days of your departure. And your destination is Madrid or anywhere outside the EU, and you have a customer loyalty card (or are paying by AmEx), you are eligible for a 50% discount on use of the Executive lounge".

Resizing the Red app on the new machine will (randomly, but very quickly) freeze the Lenovo. And that's completely frozen; no cursor movement, no ctrl+alt+del. Only way forward is to cycle the power.

Luckily (!?) this only happens when running from the Red console. Running the "compiled" .exe works fine. And I can still develop on the olde worlde laptop.

Dunno what I did. But one bug I fixed this morning had to do with font sizes. The UI has many rich-text fields (think of a table) all of which should resize at the same time. But a rounding bug in my resizing of fonts left some of them 1 point bigger than the others, sonetimes.

I fixed that UI bug and now - seemingly! - no more total system crashes. In fact, I can now resize so fast that I see the transient blank bands that hiiamboris recently reported: https://github.com/red/red/issues/5221

If you can adapt the majority of Red actions to this datatype, then maybe (although still worth considering a port! instead - hopefully ports will be able to dispatch actions into their methods).

[14:06](#msg635e85029ee3ec22b4e8b6cc)I've gone from considering CSV being a table format, to be a line based command/argument format with highly varying line lengths. It fits well with how python can, using standard libraries, read CSV files line by line, split each line up and act on each line. It makes for an easy way to transfer commands, modes and data between languages, where object structures don't really fit.

I've started storing some data in this way in REBOL too, though this required writing a proper reader and writer that can hold up to storing kilobytes or megabytes of data per line.

You could do this with a more custom and more efficient format, but anything that can produce CSV files (because sometimes you need to build or look at that data in Excel) is convenient, and most languages can read and parse CSV files line by line and act on each line.

In short, I guess I'd want the python method for understanding CSV in REBOL and derivatives, if it's ever going to be built in.

greggirwin

[17:53](#msg635eb9fd88e38704c037196a)That's easy to do with `read/lines` and then processing each line as CSV.

[20:41](#msg637d340aabfb5860bb2a858c)I've swapped MANY SSDs, but that is not the issue, of greater interest to me is learning and playing with a system that lives o an USB drive. Given how I plan to use this (mostly for quick browser access, and perhaps an app for security cameras) this seems like a great way to play with this.

I'm curious if I plug it into another computer, how it deals :)

[23:09](#msg637d569df9491f62c9c7040a)It should deal fine if you plug it into another computer. There may be rare computers that have driver issues, but those can be corrected by adding the appropriate drivers as needed.

[23:09](#msg637d56c72cb65702403cb15e)I'd definitely recommend one of those low-profile USB drives to minimize chances of snapping the drive or the USB port (we've seen it happen too many times).

The way this SHOULD work is there are bays all over just in case one wants to slide in a card (flush).

Of note, they don't mention it on the Wikipage, but it has a '2-in-1 reader (MMC, SD)' slot! I can see it on my laptop.

But this year there was some new thing, which I haven't been able to identify. Some kind of blanket of light grayish flakes in the upper water layer (5mm or so).

Ray Kurzweil believes that the AI Singularity is an event in which artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, leading to a period of rapid technological advancement. He believes that this event will occur in the early 21st century, and that it will have profound implications for humanity. Kurzweil believes that the Singularity will bring about a new era of abundance, creativity, and prosperity, and that it will ultimately lead to the end of death and disease.

One of my favorite products is the Hot Logic food warmer. You just plug it in. It changes temp over time (rises at first to heat, then goes down), but you have no control over that, other than to unplug and replug it. I also like lava lamp's simplicity, but the particles do get small if they are on for a long time. :^)

I hate all the mini data/plugs with a passion. Can't tell them apart at a glance (e.g. micro USB vs USB C), and I probably do the micros 3 times myself, because the damn things never line up right.

[19:07](#msg639387872b937b1a2eb2f7d5)My son fed a Rebol server networking program that I wrote a while back into the OpenAI engine and asked it what the code's purpose was. This is what OpenAI returned, which was 100% correct:

`This code creates a server-side program to manage a cafe-style computer service, where customers can log in and out of computers, and pay for their usage. The code includes functions to register new computers, monitor customer usage, record logins and logouts, filter results by hostname, and update the status of each computer. The code also includes an event handler to capture the close window event, which pops up a confirmation window to ask the user if they are sure they want to quit.`

[19:16](#msg6393899807ac190597e5d3b7)So I decided to try something a little different:

Me: Output a copy of the following code and insert basic comments:

```
REBOL []

align: func [
    "Forms data into a specified number of columns with optional alignment"
    data
    length
    /left
    /right
    /center
    /len
][
    if right [
        return head copy/part tail insert/dup head form data " " length (length * -1)
    ]
    if center [
        data: head insert/dup head form data " " len: (length / 2)
        data: head insert/dup tail data " " len
        return copy/part at data ((length? data) / 2 - len + 1) length
    ]
    return copy/part head insert/dup tail form data " " length length
]
```

[19:17](#msg639389c7a1ba3e75d8ecb2ae)OpenAI:

```
REBOL [] ; start of REBOL block

align: func [ ; define a function called "align"
    "Forms data into a specified number of columns with optional alignment" ; comment
    data ; argument: data
    length ; argument: length
    /left ; argument: left
    /right ; argument: right
    /center ; argument: center
    /len ; argument: len
][ ; start of function body
    if right [ ; if right is true
        return head copy/part tail insert/dup head form data " " length (length * -1) ; return the data formatted to the right
    ]
    if center [ ; if center is true
        data: head insert/dup head form data " " len: (length / 2) ; insert spaces at the head of the data
        data: head insert/dup tail data " " len ; insert spaces at the tail of the data
        return copy/part at data ((length? data) / 2 - len + 1) length ; return the data formatted to the center
    ]
    return copy/part head insert/dup tail form data " " length length ; return the data formatted to the left
] ; end of function body

; end of REBOL block
```

[19:18](#msg63938a1d865cc926ae528051)What blows me away is the line that it commented `;return the data formatted to the center` because it isn't totally obvious what that line does.

It's probably not so hard if you see a function named \*align* and a check for refinement called \*center* :-D

[23:15](#msg63af7111ff1fd121b32041ca)And another fix-update. This one improves `request` handling in Lest. Here's how to deal with a HTTP request in Lest:

```
snippet                   ; or `page`, see Lest docs what's difference

"Method: " request/method ; Lest can auto-detect if it's run inside Hub and in such case, it makes the HTTP request object available
" Query: " request/data   ; so it's easily accessible from Lest. It also convert the query (GET/POST/whatever) to Red datatypes

hr                        ; just a separator

request/*                 ; `*` is a special token that will emit whole `request` object. It's useful for debugging purposes
```

[23:24](#msg63af73330cd40c2e89b21264)And here's how to make a basic form in Lest:

```
request get %cgi.lest [  ; `request` is the keyword for a form, `get` is a method used and `%cgi.lest` is the target file called
    text "name" "value"  ; `text` is the input type, with two args, name and value. This is just a basic example, nothing fancy.
]
```

[23:27](#msg63af73e88f8df4262accf34e)You can have two files, e.g. `%index.lest` and `%cgi.lest` with separate form and actor, or you can put everything into one file and take care of the logic with Lest's built-in `if`, `either` and other conditionals.

[23:34](#msg63af757dd8678973f98c70b0)And if the Lest dialect isn't your cup of Darjeeling SFTGFOP, you're free to use good ole HTML.
