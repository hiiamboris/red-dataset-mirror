[13:50](#msg5fef28b9c746c6431cebd0f0)Happy New Year

[13:54](#msg5fef297a4eba353cdf0ff473)Reading about this project: https://omar.website/tabfs/ it might be a fun project reverse that and build a GUI from a file system. Then you manipulate the UI structure by creating different file types and the file contents would contain the widget state. Directories would be windows and panes. Buttons, fields, etc. would be files. Then you could manipulate the UI by using file system commands. I have no idea whether that could ever be useful, but I think, an interesting idea, nonetheless.

[19:36](#msg5fef79a897312f4b6b024783)@henrikmk once I have used an ERP that mapped all its GUI functionality on URI, so you could access any of its part and do whatever you want. This could be the same for a Red GUI, you access it as FS and open to scripting tools.

I think Gitter sucks dead rodents through a steel straw.

Slack sucks for the same key reason, which is if we branch (for example this Original Post I'm writing right here right now) it is hard to track and follow, and both systems do a horrible job of making this clear and easy for everyone.

I welcome IRC/Matrix, or https://www.phpbb.com/

P.S. if you want to reply to this, I vote branch it right here.  
I use = These = to trigger a good place to branch.

[18:40](#msg5ff20f9c69ee7f0422dde1a5)@ne1uno good info.

BaronRK

[19:30](#msg5ff21b60e7f693041f4b1696)= Data Protection Regulation =

I'm not sure the info (from link) is good. (nothing to do with ne1uno).

GDPR/CCPC/Nevada (and more to come) all are a complex area (I administer and have attorney review on this).

The best summary I can possibly give is this:

1\. Since it is on the Internet, you might as well support the lowest common denominator, or in this parlance, whichever rules are worst.  
2\. There is no simple flow diagram of questions that helps anyone answer this. So this is a really tricky problem to solve.  
3\. There have been no real lawsuits so far, so we don't know what is true. A law is not real until it is tested.

So, the whole thing is a nightmare.

Going forward, my own plan is as follows (this is very rough):

\- Try to connect people's personal data to a UID.  
\- Try to encrypt the local storage of it. Use Password 1  
\- Try to encrypt the long term storage of it. Use Password 2  
\- Deal with the conflict of these facts with the goal to allow people to search data easily.

If some ahole demands you remove them (their data), they can control Password 1, and you can just destroy Password 2 rending long term storage useless (or give them the password and then destroy, giving them the power to recover).

Does anyone have a better plan?

greggirwin

[20:43](#msg5ff22c60ac9d8e7463eacc5c)There's no good solution to this, and I don't know enough details to say what constitute personal data or the protection thereof. That is, data you can't sign away the rights to by clicking "I agree" on a EULA you didn't read, what rights I have to my content, and whether those are exclusive.

Is there a loophole, where you could provide a service to "manage storage and access control" but the user has ultimate control over their rented space? Kind of like co-location but with an API as well. The user "rents" space, could be a true SBC or a virtual machine, which runs an API "service" the user is in control of. The API is simple (`[insert select change remove]`) but could also have advanced features to allow analysis. The user then has a control panel where they can grant access to data with a key feature being by tag. e.g. you grant Gitter access, which automatically tags all API calls from Gitter with `gitter`. And Gitter can only access data tagged as such. Mashup services can be granted broader access. My local social agent app can write and tag and remove anything, but if it tags something `twitter` because I checked a box to post there, Twitter still only has read access to that entry.

Where this gets messy for those of us who want history frozen, is when people stop granting access, then open it up again, remove data, etc. Then it's up to each system to garnish your reputation and even boot you from their service. So everyone is incentivized to play nice. It opens up a whole new DDOS attack vector. But maybe you can also choose your storage service options, where some or all of your data lives in a blockchain. You could have blog posts editable, but code and contracts auditable.

And does RAM count as storage? If services can't cache data, their efficiency takes a massive hit, but if it's all in RAM "for current use", then we all invest in memory chip companies. :^)

[10:51](#msg5ff2f34c63fe034496384407)Two weeks after my fingers have been crunched, I have some feedback as coder POV: the cast should have an angle above 65 degrees, otherwise when the remaining finger goes down to the keyboard, the casted ones will hit the keys and disturb typing. It would be better with a different angle on the little finger, I suggest more that 75 degrees, as keyboards are raised and it has more changes of hitting the keys.

I'm sooooooooo sorry. This is why I fear building robots. I'm amazed there are not far more things like this.  
One of my closest friends (who has since passed for unrelated causes) used to build Robots for the show BattleBots. All the teams have many rules in place to prevent what could be very very very bad.

GiuseppeChillemi

[17:16](#msg5ffb365d252c0a6ded0054ec)@BaronRK We have rules too but not the needed one for this particular situation. I was correcting the belt of a new conveyor belt which was crawling on its border. Any conveyor belt has 2 rollers, one on each side, so I have put my hand on the edge of one side and started pushing the belt far from the border. Well, this conveyor belt was different: it had 3 rollers instead of 2, one acted as a counter roller to keep the belt tense. It was totally invisible and unexpected. So it took my hand out of nowhere. After this incident I have added a new rule to the others we have: if it walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, Inspect it before you handle it like a duck, it maybe have a hidden shark mouth somewhere. In other words: not everything is as it seems, inspect it visually at least one time, because known shapes may have hidden dangers.

[17:23](#msg5ffb380d4498e01bbf9bfef3)@henrikmk Thank you Henrik, I am entering my third week from the incident. Looking head to the day I will remove the cast. Until then I will be the \*\*7 Fingers Coder!\**

greggirwin

[17:51](#msg5ffb3ea4fb85d46e04d30df5)@GiuseppeChillemi thanks for the detailed info. It may save others here who work with any kind of physical device.

I used to work at a theme park, and asked someone to measure an audio rack one day. A minute later I heard a shout, saw sparks, and the other tech came flying out of the audio cage like he'd seen a snake. Turns out his tape measure, as many are, was steel. What we didn't know is that this rack was old and had bare copper bus bars on the inside, carrying electricity. He put the tape across the rack to measure, it closed the circuit between them, and POW! Fortunately he was fine, but it took a chunk out of the tape measure.

GiuseppeChillemi

[18:43](#msg5ffb4ae64498e01bbf9c2960)@greggirwin  
Yes, the lesson is the same: inspect everything for both invisible and invisible, especially when it is the first time you are working with it or there is some fault. You have to inspect the visible with eyes, the invisible (electricity) with the instruments. They are a hard lesson to learn. This time it has cost me a visit to the emergency room and one-month+ of difficulties.

[12:33](#msg600580219632f63d8724de2e)80MB for Bookmarks is really a lot.. my file has only 135kB.

[12:35](#msg6005808d252c0a6ded19fd69)I think that the reason is, that `map!` is not the best type for something like JSON, because it requires hash tables.. and as JSON file is usually transferred to map of maps, there is wasted quite a lot of memory and computation to build hashtable for each map.

[12:37](#msg600580ee252c0a6ded19fe45)@GiuseppeChillemi if you want to just parse the file to get the info from it... use just plain parse and you will have much better times. the structure is not too complicated.

[12:50](#msg600584065562a61e9ab27133)Maybe `map!` could internally use a block and not hashes for small maps with just few keys.

[12:52](#msg6005848adc2e4809aa2d5474)@ne1uno it will not be related to url parsing, because all urls are in this file stored as plain strings

[14:59](#msg6005a26e5562a61e9ab2c4ab)@Oldes My bookmarks are mixed: I use them as History. I save in folders "bursts" of search results about topics, so it increases 30/50 entries each time.

[15:09](#msg6005a4a099549911fc2d2196)I have also saved the map to Red file and `LOAD`ed it. It takes 4 seconds vs. 80.

[15:11](#msg6005a510fe007479e41cba9c)The slowness is related to parsing and conversion. because at `LOAD`ing to a `MAP` I imagine the hash tables are recalculated.

Program a lighting controller via a local access panel, rather than something more involved (e.g., longer runs, net access and security). But it could also be \*really* cool for interactive exhibits or competitions. Imagine a "close the circuit" maze game where you control relays but also have the UI and controller to navigate \*which* relays you interact with. Now make it a team or competitive setup, where it could be real time or turn based. e.g., a central unit can enable or disable your GPIO signals based on whether it's your turn, timers, etc.

Even if they aren't great for users, with moderate success in answering, they do 2 things: 1) They make the user feel like they're involved in a conversation, which is good psychologically. 2) They may not answer the question, yet lead the user to think of something that helps them. Almost certainly, even with many sessions still reaching a human, reduce support costs for companies.

What would be a cool next step for them, which must surely exist already, is using user input to train them, so you have vetted data, but also feedback beyond "Did this answer your question?" Instead, let users be even more empowered and tell you what they did or didn't do, along with their ultimate solution, even if that is "I just gave up."

And then the closest matching pattern from the list of patterns (25,817 patterns now) determines the response along with variable values committed to short term menu from earlier user inputs. So if the user said they were wearing a red dress. The AI would deduce base on the pattern matched that the AI/Gender: copy "female" such that if I then asked the AI "Am I a man or a woman?" it would answer "You are a woman." So it's really a BOt technology instead of an expert system technology. But like an expert system each pattern can have conditional logic ao i you ask "Am I a teenager?" and you've already told it your age it's &gt; 12 and &lt; 20 then it would answer "Yes you're ' AI/Age " so you're a teenger." or "No you're " AI/Age " so you're not a teenager." if the age check came back false.

&gt; In the near future, we'll EV code sign Windows Red builds.

Is it going to stop false positives in A/V software? Is it some sort of standard, and all software supports it? Will executables released with signed Red be also immune to false positives?

greggirwin

[17:38](#msg601053b0dfdbc1437fb3a25e)It should stop A/V false positives, yes. EV code signing is a major standard on Windows. Mac does something different now, and Linux doesn't do it at all AFAIK.

&gt; Will executables released with signed Red be also immune to false positives?

No. Not unless we can figure out how to pragmatically provide it as a service, which likely involves code reviews by our team. That is, a signed app is trusted, and the owner of the signing key is accountable. So even if we \*could* automate it, as soon as someone puts out a piece of malware written in Red nobody will trust our key anymore. Plus, it puts users at risk because the OS trusted the app because it was signed. So we have to be \*very* careful about what we sign.

The answer, which is pretty painful, is that each user needs to get their own key and sign their own apps. On the bright side, we have this process down now (including finding a deep issue that kept it from working initially), and can provide help.

1\. I send them a (link to a) small zip file.  
2\. They drop it into the application's folder  
3\. They restart the app - it notices the zip file, extracts the contents (usually scripts) and then restarts itself  
Done!  
(There's some fiddly code in there to roll back to a previous zip if the fix breaks things - but that is rare, and mainly invisible to the users).

[16:14](#msg6026a95324cd6b60d835ae25)I've learned a lot in the past decade, not so much about how to do things, but how 'most programmers' (and people) approach problems differently than myself.

Mostly about the fact that humans are mostly task-oriented, vs goal-oriented.

Permit me this rabbit hole as an example:

How many times have programmers written login code? Why is this not a stand-alone fully functioning single command?

(think of all the overhead and code and time of every website out there for login related crap)

Why are logins still User name, and then a separate Password field?

(be careful with your answer, you might as well consider this my Queens Gambit, and if you don't know it, then you lose in 4 moves)

So mostly what I have changed is how I present things, but we are missing a few tools that I believe (hope) will move people (and programmers) forward faster.

Much like there is a tool called a Word Processor (that mimics paper), and a Spreadsheet (that mimic ledgers), I hope a more fully comprehensive Flow Chart system will dramatically change how people mimic 'knowledge'

greggirwin

[16:54](#msg6026b2ce4f7d1b68e54a11c4)I think there's a psychological aspect that aligns with tasks v goals: we're lemmings. Doing something different takes courage, but is also interesting in that it's not good for your individual survival to break with the tribe. It's not just programmers, but artists, inventors, musicians, writers, creators of all kinds. Doing something new and different is risky, and has a higher probability of failure, but it's those "mutations" that drive evolution.

Software reuse didn't exist on a large scale, though people tried to force it, until the web, JS, and NPM. Maybe we can liken it to a biological system as well. Not a virus, but more like cancer perhaps. Not trying to insult the tech, just thinking about how it works. And like cancer it doesn't have a plan. It just grows until it kills its host. I think this applies to both the users and the system itself, and people have to actively fight this cancer.

What's tragically ironic is that we, as programmers, don't often break new ground. Not in any significant way. I was reminded of this while doing `split` research; every language just copied what other langs had. But we \*don't* just use someone else's, or think about having other use it. This is your task focus at play. We want to do our own thing, thinking our version will be better, but so very rarely think in terms of empathy for others or the goal of the greater good. Is it the biological competitive wiring that makes us "fight" in this way? Is that also why nobody like to do maintenance? Old bushes are picked clean and we want to move on to greener pastures.

What's been missing is a gene pool and a method of natural selection. NPM has a lot of arrows in its back, and `left-pad` (I hope) taught the world some lessons, but someone had to be first in this global mess. I have many thoughts on this. Right now, though, I'll try to change one small thing in the world and see if I can save a few lemmings.

Login you can share, password you cannot. It made sense back in the day. Now it's usually email+pwd, just because email is the closest thing to universally accepted unique identity we have today. A silent agreement of our time.  
Oauth is different but born dead since nobody (in their sane mind) wants to centralize control over what site one can or cannot visit.  
There's a bunch of great blockchain based auth mechanisms but we've yet to see who of them wins the day.

hiiamboris

It may not seem so but it's extra complexity.  
1\. This raises a question of format: name then password or password then name? what is the accepted delimiter? E.g. Matrix IDs were first id@matrix.org, then they changed it to @id:matrix.org and imagine every site accepting it's own format of that..  
2\. Security from cameras and loiterers and just colleagues occasionally passing by. Password field is hidden by asterisks and it should not be cached by both browser and whatever autosuggestion system your OS incorporates. Totally different rules.

Yes!, just input.

'name then password or password then name? '

I'll put forth, everyone knows it is name then password, the same way they know first name then last name. And if the Japanese put in last name first, guess what, they will LEARN.

Which brings me to your second point, this is already solved, we post it with '\*\*\** \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*'  
Add one of those \[Eye] icons if you want to see it plain text.

Again, there is no 'good' reason to have to fields. It just wastes time.

In the case of email + password, we are pretty sure which is the email, so we can show that plain text, and hide just the password.

I want to make a very serious statement here:

\- Just because we can come up with edge cases or corner cases, does not mean they actually matter.

\- They have to be weighed against the alternatives.

The fact is, name or email + password should be in one field.  
Other things that should be allowed to be entered into one field are addresses, all credit card info (name, number, date, code) again, because, it all wastes human time and overhead not to.

That does not address the issue. How do you have '\*' for the password but not the username if they're in the same field? How do you partially cache this string so that only username is remembered?

[21:50](#msg6026f83793539e2343705764)I disagree with the credit card argument as well ;)  
Separate fields exist because they all have different data types and consequently different validator algorithms. And also they are prefixed with the field name which tells what to input where, because otherwise the first thing people would feel when presented with such enter-everything-here field is confusion. Usually the form even visually presented to look like a card so people won't mess it up.

You should rather fight the "Address line 1" / "Address line 2" custom they have in the US. What a meaningless thing ;)

[21:59](#msg6026fa3493539e2343705d39)I also fail to see how multiple fields waste human time. When you enter the last digit into one field you are usually instantly moved into the next one.

[22:05](#msg6026fbc0a37fc1784c1a7ce2)Regarding IP addresses. Is `111111` a `1.1.1.111` or `1.1.11.11` or `1.1.111.1` or ... one of many other variants?

greggirwin

[22:49](#msg602705e8726a881d4f6f53fc)There are many aspects to this.

First, there is no average user or even use case. Everybody is new to a system at least once. Some people enter the same data a hundred times a day, or more. If you start with a blank page, you can't possibly know what to do, but if a field says "New Appointment:" and you know that means a date and the name, rank, and serial number, you can type `2 wks from today Lt G.S. Irwin #123-456-7899` rather than selecting from a calendar, drop down of ranks, name...does it want full first and middle or just initials?, and 3 fields that eventually tell you there are too many chars in one of them...

But you'll still get it wrong sometimes. So this is where the world needs to work more like Interactive Fiction. You enter something and it says "I don't know what LEFTENNANT is.", kindly providing you suggestions and, ultimately confirmation about what it understood, narrowing errors as you go. You don't get that today. It's all or nothing. Not "These all look good \[list], but you forgot the rank. Since I wasn't busy, I used the serial number to look it up. Sorry to hear you were demoted."

What we have today is rude machines that let you enter 20 fields of info, then slap you in face, throw away what you wrote (not always, but often enough), and say "Wrong! Try again.". Then we have the gall to say we care about UX, even coining an acronym for it, when all we really do is polish turds.

You've probably heard me talk about interrogative interfaces, and that's what I think Reichart is keying into (pun intended). Can you enter an ambiguous IP address? Sure, and the system can say "Either you're drunk again or your cat is trying to SolarWinds somebody. My best guess is one of these: ..."

Anyone ever hear of Expect? Imagine what this looks like in an automated future. No, really.

See, and here we begin the core conversation.

&gt; Are you saying you can't solve all use cases?

&gt; I'll stop on this one until we resolve just this before moving forward.

I'll answer with Gregg's words :)

&gt; What we have today is rude machines that let you enter 20 fields of info, then slap you in face, throw away what you wrote (not always, but often enough), and say "Wrong! Try again.".

I had an experience this year where I lost about an hour just trying to make an order on the site. I reentered A LOT of fields like 20 times before it worked. Then I lost a day on people who were more unreliable than their machines ;)

Or also funny, just from yesterday. We have this most popular (or number 2) online shopping and delivery service, where I order a toothbrush. They sent me an email that it's ready for pickup. But guess what they didn't tell me? WHERE. No address. I logged into their stupid site and poked around for 15 minutes or so - absolutely no info on the address. I found a support bot hidden there somewhere and asked it, and it immediately told me all I ever wanted to know. They're idk like 20 years in business. Such a shame, it's pathetic.

And you think people of such "talent" would design you an intelligent password field that will even look up how long you've been using it and will adapt automatically to your level of experience?

That has drawbacks - such as the inability to validate on the fly (as on Reichart's example) - but it also has UI advantanges as the user is not interupted with validation messages while they are typing. Micosoft's Clippy was not a success.

Peter Wood and I worked together to make this (it's open source as it should be)

You could lock any message with any private password. So for example, if this message in Gitter used this, I could lock this message, those without the password would see this message from me as simple LOCKED.

But clearly you might end up collecting a lot of keys. So we gave you Lock Boxes to put the keys in.  
But that still wastes your time after you unlock you box.

So we allow you to unlock your box once, and then we will use each key you have on any message. Bingo, life is no longer painful.

[16:25](#msg6027fd81a8c6a77848094ad5)@BaronRK and ALL: I know nothing about web technology. My code is highly reusable on Redbol: I have a context that contains the VID values needed in the events code, the data sources, and also the words associated with the VID objects. Then a function will do the magic and builds the VID Block bound to my context and to VID.  
How to build it reusable for the advent of Red on the Web? I see such nice modern WEB UIa and I suppose they are made of javascript code that generates the rendering code for the UI and interacts with server-side code. Should I suppose I'll have to generate this Javascript code or a Red one could be able to render it without the need for JS one?

If you will allow me, let's pretend you are making a Calculator.  
Simply put, start with just building your parser and calculator as a black box function that can be called from anything (API). Use a state machine for your settings and system state.

So no talk of UI here (other than through a command line).

If you just did this alone, we have 98.6% compatibility between the world of Rebol/Red etc. and other interfaces, such as the Web.

The UI conversation is one that has to do with making a dedicated language and the shit show that is JavaScript and HTML work together, which is sadly pathetic.

But by saying 'i do' you would also be saying that something about my model of the UI undermines security, you will need to be very clear how that might happen.

GiuseppeChillemi

[16:36](#msg602800048031c8234bdc1400)Another model I imagine for such web tech could consists of a transcoder from RED to WebAssembly and the browser data domain mapped to Red a one. Then the generated web assembly code would render the UI and interact with server-side one.

'(1) I don't think this unification improves anything,'

Indeed, this is your opinion. I'm trying to get our opinions out of this conversation. I'm attempting to objectively prove value, leverage, and advantage.

'it increases complexity by an order of magnitude for no reason'

This is what you need to prove. Please remember, I don't care what the programmers have to do, I care what the users do.  
Google Search is MILLIONS of lines of code for one input box. Right?

'(3) lemmings‚Ñ¢ are gonna screw it badly (think 80% sites).'

I'm not sure what that meant.

This diagram with examples demonstrates the user can do things as they do now, OR, my Single Entry Field makes things always BETTER.

https://www.figma.com/file/nimk1TBSYSFjOQyP1lPAJn/Misc.-Things?node-id=130%3A2

I put it upon you, or anyone of course, to prove specifically and directly it does not.

But let's stay away from opinion. Put in mechanical terms, I want to fill in a Credit Card form old way, would need copy and paste 4 times, or if you like (from one's memory) typing, and then moving the cursors from the keyboard, or finger, or mouse 4 times. SEF reduces this to 1 time.

And then, has added benefit of dealing with some edge cases and correcting them for you. So as swapping info into the correct fields for you if it can be deduced or even induced.

[18:45](#msg60296fde8031c8234bdf4821)@planetsizecpu

I'm not 100% sure I follow (I truly could be dense).  
I do know Email addresses have problematic edge cases for their formats.

However, this is why I believe such problems should be solved by calling on centralised (or decentralised if you think of this like DNS) parsing rules.  
In other words, Let's say you have a website, and you want to parse an email, that is using a new top-level domain you have never seen before.  
This should not be your problem as a programmer. You should send the part after the @ to a site to tell you if it is REAL (per se), right?

You can do it locally (Javascript) to the level that you pulled all the info from some other site as well. Shouldn't ICANN provide this. IN FACT, shouldn't ICANN offer a DiaGrammer page to show the logic and proof of resolving emails?

This is one of my patents in fact https://patents.justia.com/patent/8386517

Translated back into actual English (trust me when I tell you I did not like the way that patent was written), the patent describes exactly the process of a system that tracks and shares the rules of confirming what data is, thus 54.67 could be temperature, money, etc. But statistically, it might be deduced further from other data around it. 558-52-2418 is a SS#, but unlikely to be a telephone number. etc.

Imagine a magical system that you can ask what it thinks a given data string is!  
but wait, there's more, what if it would give you a unique ID for that data type?

Thus 555-1212 is a phone number in America, but does not proclaim where, it needs an Area Code.  
Id = 1 = US Phone number for all states and territories.

213.555.1212 is also a phone number, in Los Angeles probably.  
Id = 1.1 = US Phone number with an area code.

See, we suddenly have a way to encode or decode data itself!

We can solve all problems, and made the 'experience of the user' better. That is all I care about.

As a byproduct, once we get over the hill of 'increases complexity by an order of magnitude for no reason' as described (LOL), then things should get much easier for programmers.

That all make sense?

Put in mechanical terms, I want to fill in a Credit Card form old way, \*\*would need copy and paste 4 times\*\*, or if you like (from one's memory) typing, and then moving the cursors from the keyboard, or finger, or mouse 4 times. SEF reduces this to 1 time.

Now we're talking. The most important detail I made in bold. So what you actually want is just a tiny bit smarter paste operation that would switch to the next field when it encounters a new-line char. And it will be just so much simpler than reshaping the internet quest! ;)  
If I like typing however, I just hit Tab instead of Enter and nothing changes for me.  
If I was filling so many forms that it would bother me I would have used AHK or some other automation tech. I think for the average internet user like me this question never arises, because there simply is \*no time overhead\*. I enter stuff once on a site and it's held there for years.

What I actually want is a dozen other things, but yes, you gave one use case.

Here is my use case, which I have checked with hundreds of people:

Assumes:

1\. Starting from just a cell phone.  
2\. Using Credit Card info.  
3\. People who do NOT want to store this info on LastPass, or some such (but rather in their own locked text notepad), nor do they want it in a browser.  
4\. They do have the number in a locked notepad that they can copy from.

Thus

1\. They can select the entire single line.  
2\. Paste the entire line into the first field of the Credit Card Form.  
3\. DONE

Happiness.

I can provide dozens of use cases for real examples like this.  
So again, SEF does not get in your way as a user, but makes life better for millions of people all day long.

I immediately thought of \[UTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal\_Transverse\_Mercator\_coordinate\_system), though there's a \[milgrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military\_Grid\_Reference\_System) version as well (name pun as an ode to Stanley Milgard). What made me LOL was that they use completely random words. Seems they want to make it more human friendly, but is it really? Street names are sometimes historical, but now random words developers like here in the U.S. Some places (Utah and Washington) use grid numbers, which locals can use effectively, but visitors not so much. Theoretically, if you're a grid loving engineer and you learn about the system, you should be able to find your way around the maze, but I don't know how many people do that.

There are many ideas here.

Naming a location, in isolation, with random words, aims to solve the "this location is always called X.Y.Z" problem, and gives a short bit of text to tell you where it is. That makes it a precise, concise notation for waypointing, though it will look like gibberish.

Waypointing ties to how we find things via relative directions. You have to know where X is to get to Y from it, and from there Z. This assumes none of those points are moving. i.e. this is not \[Dead Reckoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead\_reckoning), but...can we put these things together? I don't mean that `milgrd` + reckoning = `Mildred`, but that's fun too.

`Milgrd` gets more precise the more info you add to the coordinate. In practical use, a system could infer the major grid numbers, or pre-fill them from your location. So you give your friends just the next part, with as much precision as you want. The most precise is the cafe table you're sitting at. Social distancing makes this easy, so we should keep it. But maybe you're at a faire and you know you'll be wandering in a section of it. Now your local motion tracker can note `[+1E -2N +4E ...]`without talking to GPS (need elevation too), and your friend can see where you were, then the waypoints you meandered through, so they can dead reckon how to intercept you. Then people can annotate grid elements, like on a game map that uses A* path finding, and live data can be used to track traffic so you don't see just a red bang! noting a road is slow, but how it narrows to 2 lanes, and each lane is red/green/yellow. Then you crash because you were looking at your phone.

In fact, you brought up ANOTHER great example. If I want to give YOU money, the way that should work is the person receiving should just 'generate' a code, that contains all that crap, to the point where whomever they give it to (even many people) can simply send that number money. They don't NEED to know who or any of the details, not even the bank, just the number. One could always provide more info.

But all said, you shove that code into the sending bank's single field, it confirms it is a real number, MIGHT show you info about it (might not), and away your money goes there.

[02:13](#msg6029d8e09403f11bb58312a8)@hiiamboris Agreed.

And, so, clearly, our goal is to take the best examples and use cases and interfaces and logic etc.  
But we (the programmers, designers, engineers) are not ourselves building system that let us do this.

Once we work out the best way to unify the keys around the building it needs to be easy to propagate this to all buildings. It has to be easier than any alternative.

With all the numbers from my card numbers, you are very close to being able to remove money from my account / buy goods on my card etc.  
So the two strings need different levels of protection.  
Not saying current schemes are ideal, just that what works with IBAN is dangerous with card info.

[22:01](#msg602aef467ba8124e54697b36)Totally agreed.

As it stands though, and the philosophy I'm proposing with Single Entry Feild is that I'm augmenting what already exists, and a problem all data transfer practices face.  
There is always a better (and safer) way to do things). But still does not address the issues across systems.

Keep in mind, as far as I'm concerned, you should be able to PASTE into the first field even JSON, REBOL, CSVs, and it will do it's best to fill things in for you.  
Since there is nothing we are doing here that is not already happening manually one field at a time by a human.

But making humans fil in fields all day long is DUMB.

\[side note, I booked some flights in a few weeks. I spent 20min studying and filling in data.

I did not know my companion's Global Travel number. But when I forwarded the Itinerary over to them, they were able to use the Magic code the airline gave me for this flight to change it themselves.

I'm archiving 35 year old data (3.5" floppies) from Amiga to PC.  
I have about 500 Floppies. I have access to an Amiga 4000. It has a disk drive that can read PC floppies. It has large HD, enough to hold all floppies probably  
My current plan is to copy all the Amiga Floppis into the Amiga HD, giving each floppy a smart folder name (i.e. 'FirePower-Dev-ver563')

I already looked into ways to get the data out ofan Amiga onto a USB drive for example, and the overhead to make this is work (seems) sadly too much time and energy. I'm not sure why no one just made a simple USB to Amiga Parallel port adapter (Amiga's Par was bi-directional, and super fast).

But my real question right now is, what is the FASTEST way to copy an entire desk into the HD?

Just 'copy' takes about 2 minutes.

What did you learn at the end of a programming architecture/project you deeply wish you knew at the start?

I have lots of course - But two key ones for example:

\- I would force almost all functions into APIs.  
\- Construct DataBases to allow for summaries (counts, most recent) are super easy to get.

It happens when you see everything as modifiable and you build your own constructors and use them to create in place of the built-in ones. You start evolving the language for you, create your make+, func+, for+; you are fast in using parse, making dialects, finding new shapes, and every block is not fixed but under your control.

Respectech

[17:07](#msg6033e4d89403f11bb59d0f79)Generally, today's web browsers are considered stateless as far as the page is concerned. The browser itself carries state, like history, but not the page itself.

greggirwin

[17:19](#msg6033e79c47585464db95a15f)Hmmm. That doesn't sound right in my head. With JS and local storage, there is a lot of local state. Maybe that's why I'm confused. How do we define "state" in this context.

[17:21](#msg6033e8136825b964d6272798)It is localized state, that the browser doesn't manage directly. Is that the distinction? It's like the whole "stateless" aspect of frameworks, or FP. To get anything done we have to have state, it's just a matter of how it's managed.

Respectech

[18:50](#msg6033fcf98621811d589373e1)As I stated before, the browser itself isn't stateless, but pages are. If you switch from one page to another, the only way to transfer state is through cookies, post/get data, etc. I'm speaking specifically of allowing variables/objects/etc to stay set when navigating between different pages without having to jump through hoops (writing files to the local drive, explicitly transferring data through post / get, etc.)

greggirwin

[19:08](#msg60340142dc108172e7938c00)To me that doesn't mean pages (a page) are stateless. e.g. JS vars, field contents, and the DOM itself are state. Having state is not the same as transferring state, but the premise of \[HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) is just that. If all you can do is read static content, then you could consider things as stateless and fully idempotent.

[19:09](#msg6034017b4c7921574902bbd4)So maybe we come back to your original question. What is it we need to do, and what do the two ways of doing it look like?

Respectech

[19:14](#msg603402a547585464db95ef12)The way I see it is something along the lines of `func` and `function`, but in the context of a page. When authoring a page, the author decides whether any defined words are part of the local (to the page) or global (to the browser) context. That way, a single author can have multiple pages interact with each other without jumping through hoops. Also, multiple authors can work with other pages to pull in state.

greggirwin

[19:19](#msg603403ba4c7921574902c28a)Got it. There are a number of ways it can be done. Most importantly, a page can't "go global" for security reasons, they need to be sandboxed. But pages should be able to talk to each other via IPC, and even set up secure channels and storage for doing so.

BaronRK

[20:36](#msg603415e59337c51bc6a36566)Stateful/Stateless are nebulous words ensured to cause arguments between even smart people trying to agree with each other sadly.

https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/stateful-vs-stateless

So anything I write next is not an argument, but a clarification of my opinions.

I wrote BOTH above because:

\- Cookies ARE a state (IMO). That is one of many tricks to transfer data between pages.

\- I think (IMO) that sites should have certs to allow them to be part of other sites and treated as such. This concept of every site is a silo seems silly to me (and an illusion anyway). So 'for security they need to be sandboxed' is agreed in sentiment. But if Prolific wants to allow you to access Googles API or save your files to AWS you can't stop us, so security is an illusion anyway. Why not just allow us to Connect to AWS and let the user know this?

\- Func/Function - Agreed! So we should have shared Context, of we could just think of this as a shared storage. That simple. I badly want this. I want every website to know I hate Time Roman Font, so unless they have a damned good reason to show me, DON'T. THis is a perfect example of shared settings and if we work that out, we can work out almost everything (I'm a fan of REAL WORLD examples).

greggirwin

[21:05](#msg60341c944c79215749030acd)In the context of a Red browser things can be very different. When I talk about sandboxes I'm thinking in terms of how processes on an OS are isolated from each other and a `secure` dialect that works in conjunction with capabilities (in the E lang sense, much like phone apps work). So your "page" can't poke its nose out into the browser context and sniff around \*unless* you specifically give it rights to. It can't access the net unless you say it's OK. It can't access your file system outside its own area, get your contact info, or use all the CPU or memory.

This kind of granular control will be a real pain to manage, especially when you talk about services that are abstracted away from you. So we'll need ways to say "I trust this vendor (cert holder) and grant anything \*they* give me the following privileges: ..." They, in turn, have granted rights to other services, libs, etc. and you should be able to see that as a tree and check off, like an installer with options, what you want to allow. Maybe some are required and others are optional and you lose functionality by turning turning them off. Eventually it will be like a EULA nobody reads.

But this also opens up new avenues. Here's our free version, but you MUST allow ads. If you want to turn ads off, or other ways we monetize you as our product, we'll give you a RED/BTC total at the end of the setup process.

[21:11](#msg60341dfa9ba13e72e4483be0)This can then all be viewed like site settings in a browser, cookies/certs/access, but adding those contexts like channels and shared storage which allow apps/pages to collaborate and better leverage resources, not to mention creating workflow and dataflow possibilities that are so painful today.

[21:20](#msg6034203a7ba8124e54816628)On the other hand, state is useful. I do remember Rebol IOS and the problem that while the system was nice and dynamic, it missed the ability to have some simple cross-widget api.

AWS has eaten everybody's lunch for a long time, but at the end of the day they still need to run code, and code is written in languages. What happens when you deploy on AWS and every package being pulled in makes MS money? It's brilliant, if they can pull it off.

Windows gets undercut by Linux and open source, then containers reduce Windows VM use even further. It looked like the king of dev tools and OSs got undermined, because how do you get underneath the infrastructure? You do it by realizing it's a big circle, and everything that's been virtualized was done so with software. The \*really* brilliant thing is that by making AWS et al be the "last mile", they carry the heavy load. Running a package registry, by comparison, is a drop in the bucket.

[10:16](#msg604de28095e23446e433ad5c)I don't see how anything from that article kills JavaScript. If JavaScript dies, it's because despite being one of the three standard languages of the web, it is unable to serve the needs of its community. It just seems like an outlandish claim to me. If Microsoft starts charging for free software packages on those platforms, that would be the surest way to kill the platforms and cause users to migrate away. I don't think they really care anymore about being undercut by open source software. They just want to charge rent for the machines that run them, but with Amazon having such a huge first-mover advantage, it's the de facto standard. It's not hard for me to believe that they mainly see GitHub as a way to push developers toward Azure rather than AWS.

In Carl's original demo of REBOL (then called LAVA) I recall he made a Recipe for some food. It looked like a recipe too, but in fact contained just enough code to execute and convert English measure to Metric.

I've been complaining about the 'round trip' lacking in data since I delved into iCal protocol (which was really lacking).

[22:35](#msg60591ba43a9448256c22ccd2)@oldes  
I can understand why but what you think stupid is the most strong move that can be done: Carl has dressed Rebol with JSON paraments. The world could be attracted from the JSON like appearance and concepts and then embrace to undergoing language which, I repeat, is Rebol... with some new workings.

Oldes

[22:36](#msg60591bf588edaa1eb8d3fc97)I like the slogan \_Write Data Not Code\_... but I'm not sure if I like some changes in the comparison with Rebol... like `##"..."` for base64, `''...''` for long/multiline strings, `@false` etc. I'm also missing a specification for making comments inside the \_data/code\_. Better to wait for making any comments. As was already mentioned in the main Red chat room.. it may be years before something else bubble up from it.

[22:42](#msg60591d4a68921b62f47d04db)Also I have a feeling, that world is now leaving JSON for YAML. But that is just a proof, that JSON is not the best format and there is a room for other... but I'm not sure, who will write ASON versions in Python, Ruby, Rust and other languages, so it could be better adopted.

GiuseppeChillemi

[22:46](#msg60591e3588edaa1eb8d401da)I have asked myself the same thing. The reason could be simple: the author has not understood Rebol, while he could have liked the arrays/objects structure.

greggirwin

[22:47](#msg60591e76ac0fd631ca85c3a5)Douglas Crockford understood Rebol, and still does. He also made firm design choices and was limited in making JSON a strict subset of JS.

GiuseppeChillemi

[22:48](#msg60591ebfc1e10242c5b85a07)@greggirwin Is this the same reason why we have `{"element": "something"}` with double quotes around the key?

Oldes

[22:49](#msg60591edead83ec3d7d4904ec)I also believe that D.C. understand Rebol very well... but \*\*JSON was designed to be easily parsed\*\*... in comparison with Rebol, which is quite complicated to be parsed.

GiuseppeChillemi

[22:50](#msg60591f272beb1e1da3c4042d)The Rebol way is much better: `{element: "something"}` and also the parser would be not so complicated.

Carl once stated something like - concentrate upon your target and don't listen to the nay sayers, as it is never too late.

[05:50](#msg605981902beb1e1da3c4e941)In fact, I find Carl's idea brilliant. I do remember the bold era of XML dominance, and how rudiculed attempts like JSON were. JSON is a great proof, that ppl actually are for the simplifications. And Rebol is a proof, that declarative languages have some merit. Explain Java FX and Qt quick, being mostly (especially JAVA FX) rip-offs of View/VID.

[05:52](#msg6059820dc1e10242c5b945e7)So if you can't dominate the world with the whole langage, give ppl the taste of the top concepts. For me thy were always be dialecting, hence parse, View/VID and ports/schemes concepts. I have suggested RT some 15 years ago to create a CLI version of Parse.

Having only needed to touch it a few times, YAML has tripped me up with things that look the same, or seem so to me, but aren't. It's the same for those coming \*to* Red. Hard at first because it's different. What matters is long term pain, ease, and clear communication in data.

There is something to be said for formats that impose structure. It does have benefits. But it also comes with a cost.

dsunanda

[20:37](#msg605a516cac0fd631ca890acf)Before XML and JSON for config files, we had CSV and INI.  
Of all those four, INI is the only one you could just about trust an expert user to edit without messing up (on a good day that is).  
ASON looks like a good evolutionary step upward from INI - so it can have my vote :)

Respectech

[21:03](#msg605a578ff07ffa1eb55ef2f9)Regarding @greggirwin 's comment on structure being good sometimes, I've been programming advanced 3d objects in OpenSCAD for the past year or two, which I understand is akin to Haskell in how it imposes structure. Hate it. I hate it enough to want to write a replacement for OpenSCAD in Red (but I don't have the bandwidth for that). Also, the syntax drives me crazy.

greggirwin

[21:21](#msg605a5be03a9448256c262416)What's interesting WRT syntax and punctuation is that we have necessarily force-fit things for our purposes. Punctuation helps structure prose and denote groups in natural language, but what we think of as data structures (key-val or table) are hacks to some extent and there is no real consensus.

I thought braces were a good choice in Rebol, because of the hand-written use of them for grouping lines of text. Using them for objects is still a grouping, so isn't an unreasonable choice. But replacing that with multiple single quotes for ML strings is a harder sell for me.

INI files are a great format (we should have a codec even though their largely out of fashion), and are like R2 VID; easy to use for many common cases, but also not hard to run up against their limits.

[21:24](#msg605a5c7ef07ffa1eb55f0443)Looks like there were a few INI parser in the old rebol.org library, one of which was @dsunanda's.

[21:29](#msg605a5dae9ebdfd164093a58e)@Oldes and Marco Antonazzi both have parse based versions from the library as well, for comparison.

[21:31](#msg605a5e262beb1e1da3c75278)We have a TOML grammar in DG, which should also be considered for how the output structures line up, as well as with how JSON is used in config contexts.

dsunanda

[21:32](#msg605a5e5ac1e10242c5bbbc92)@greggirwin My one in Rebol.org needs some changes to run in Red (I have the Reddified version if anyone wants it).  
Also, for flexibility, it breaks the INI standard - if a keyword occurs multiple times, each line is collected in a block; otherwise it returns a string

greggirwin

[21:33](#msg605a5e99c1e10242c5bbbd15)Those are some of the design choices. e.g. collect, strict, `transcode` values, etc.

[00:30](#msg605a8818ac0fd631ca899adb)@greggirwin The good thing having braces for objects is that you do not need the MAKE constructor, which makes things a lot easier and nicer to look.

Shelly has no way to select a specific one, a frequency or a max address, or select the strongest signal. So you never know what it will be coupled during setup. This is a major drawback of a device like this which can be used in large areas.  
Another problem was the sudden heavy drain of the battery when the device is distant. My hypothesis is that the device tries to connect to a distant access point when it activates and it fails so the connection hung or keeps failing forever. Se I have from 50% to 0% in 24h.

[23:29](#msg6063b46847b0403241acb0ca)&gt; We must always be on guard.

Our chat has been prophetical, after our talk something happened to me, I was hacked! Here is a the story:  
After the chat I have continued working into my company, where I have set up my Shelly devices up to 00:15 AM. Then I have switched off the office lights, closed the doors and moved home. This morning I have connected to my PC via AnyDesk. When the screen has opened I have found something strange: the remote desktop was black with a browser window opened at its center and the site was my bank institute. I have not made any action on that computer! Also, there was a server error on it. I have closed this browser and realized a console with PROCMON was the window making the screen appear black. I have started to panic! What was happening? Was someone inside my machine? The answer came just after: another browser window was open, inside it I have found a bank transfer was stopped at the second authentication, that one connected to my phone device. The one no man could pass without hacking my phone. Another quick view on the second monitor and my password manager was open, four password tabs open, and also Microsoft edge open and used. The heart was pumping loud with my body and mind full of adrenaline. I have closed the phone call with my secretary telling her "my blood has frozen, there is a problem, I will call you later". I have then thought at max speed what to do, which information could the hacker already have in his hands after having accessed all my passwords. I have thought that he could still have not changed the most important password: the one of the email account where I receive my confirmation email for password changes and the one of the passwords manager itself (that I have never written anywhere). I disconnected because that machine was unsafe, and tried to access those accounts via my local machine. The password manager was either not authenticating me and after a successful attempt, it has frozen multiple times! My hypothesis was the attacker could have changed the credentials and some sort of erratic state could be between the remote password manager state and the local one. Ok, I will try it later. With just the passwords in my local browser cache, the password manager was still able to let me log in to my email account. It could be a matter of time, seconds before the attacker could have changed the password, so blocking me from everything and having full power to change the credentials.... heart was racing...  
(next part of the story will be tomorrow, it's very late here...)

¬†\*It could be a matter of time, seconds before the attacker could have changed the password, blocking me from everything and having full power to change the credentials.... heart was racing‚Ä¶*

I was able to login into my email account and I have changed its password. This was my greatest fear: the hijack of the email I use to register on all sites. Being able to get its full control, I have felt a sense of safety. Now it was time to understand if the company site has been fully compromised or just my machine. I have checked for the antivirus but I have not found it installed and this was strange, I didn't remember having removed it. I have reinstalled Kaspersky and also, other tools to check for possible backdoors and suspicious activity. Before leaving I have begun a deep scan.  
I have then move to my company location...

I have traveled 30 minutes depicting in my mind all the steps I would have to do. Sunlight was strong as in Sicily, the last 2 days were very hot days, spring is here in its full power and birds, butterflies and gnats are flying around, also flowers and trees were covered of colors!  
When I have reached our office, the second round of my work has begun: I have seated in front of my PC and I have started searching for other signs of activity on the security register of all of my servers. I have changed the remote access tool password, added a 2FA as OTP, and removed a couple of those RA tools used from our ERP seller. In the meantime, the antivirus deep scan has ended with few low threat warnings. Still no sign of activity, maybe the hacker will return later to complete the work. In the meantime, I was able to access the password manager GUI from my mobile, so my safety sensation was higher! Having done my best and needing this machine for some work I have set up a personal work policy for the day. After having taken other security measures in the remaining computers of the company, I have started using the compromised one. The policy was to never enter any password, no login to any site, do only simple jobs where no data could be taken to perform further breaches or facilitate them.

[22:03](#msg60664338ed315705c2912d4d)\*\*\[Hacked, 3/3]\**  
The remaining part of the day has passed quickly. When has been time to leave I have closed the windows, turned off the lights with my monitor being the only thing emitting light in the dark. I have cleared all the servers' passwords and moved to my home. My intention was to let the target machine available to the hacker while being able to access the whole site and this machine remotely. At 22:30, when a thief could suppose nobody was in the office, I have connected remotely and... \*surprise!!!* All the windows were open again. With my heart racing, I have realized there was a remote RDP session open. Maybe I have forgotten it or the hacker has had access to it. Windows were still opening, the task manager was in front of everything, and there were mouse activity on the taskbar. I have caught him! Here is the video of the hacker in action: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-upP2wlCWQ5qNUIuiE\_4k9zOzSWTEArF/view?usp=sharing on the bottom you can sport a circle that corresponds to his mouse clicks. Few seconds and I have realized they were the same circles I have seen about 1,5 ago in this story: :point\_up: \[october 2019 15:25](https://gitter.im/red/chit-chat?at=5da1d42fc87a1d28ac9869b9) ‚Ä¶. The circles, their slow-moving, strange clicks patterns like small sudden jumpings, too many windows open, circles instead of mouse pointers, the sunny days, insects everywhere, the PC screen being the only source of light in the room and I have realized what was happening! Some butterfly or gnat was jumping on the touch screen! And it was opening applications and windows randomly, including the task manager! Oh my God, everything is now clear: some bug should have clicked on the monitor for the whole previous night! The most incredible thing is that the insect was able to open Procmon, a console, Chrome, retrieve my last bank session that could have been minimized and not closed, initiating it, and stopping at 2FA! Also, it has opened EDGE (I have never used it) changing its configuration to tabs minimized above the address bar as miniatures, and also activating the last password manager window. Of all the possible windows/programs combinations the destiny, incarnated under the tiny pawns of the gnat, has chosen to let me find open the only one capable of triggering a big hacker alert, Including starting a bank transfer on the most hacked institute in my country. Before leaving with this incredible story, I have had to look at only one piece of information capable of confirming this is what has really happened: the last login record of my account on the bank portal (I have not opened it before because I was on the compromised machine). It reported 3 days ago and not yesterday. Horray! Now I could relax and sleep.

https://stationhq.com/blog/a-new-era-for-station

Station was an application, built on Electron to group common webapps and make them searchable. Using Electron turned out to cause so many bugs and so much resource hogging, that the developer simply gave up.

Imagine if common webapps were built in Red/REBOL and Station was a Red/REBOL application. It would have consumed 1/100th the resources, while being able to perform the same tasks.

I'm still greatly in favor of having Red/REBOL in a browser form factor, one that people understand. I think that could make Red popular if it directly attacked the web application space.

Once you have more than one moving part and compromise in that vein, and none of the other solutions know or care about each other, you end up with a hodge-podge and no conceptual integrity. \*But* you can still say you architechted and designed it. :^)

[15:57](#msg606c84e41dbd860a233589bc)There are MANY parallels between building houses and software (more than between building hardware and building software in my opinion, which is what most would think).

I'm always fascinated though in building houses (which I do often as my own hobby) how many custom parts are needed, and there is no way around it. How many standards there are, and how things that look similar are in fact not.

Consider just pipe fittings. There are a dozen isles filled with what is basically the same almost identical shapes, but firstly made of different materials. Schedule 40 PVC pipe is a great example, because they are so identical you can even fit most of it to each other from Electrical Schedule 40 (more expensive, and gray) to Water Schedule 40 (usually white, sometimes purple, etc.). But, they are in fact not the same, and while one can use electrical for water, the other way around is very much not advised (although, technically it would be mostly fine for the record). Due to wall thickness, UV protection, etc.

Should we make it such that it can be used for either?

https://www.commercial-industrial-supply.com/resource-center/difference-between-plumbing-pvc-and-electrical-pvc/

Same for Metal pipes for water and gas. Again, they look the same, but the fittings are slightly different.

I view file formats this way. There are reasons and advantages to having data stored in formats specific to what you are doing. One size does not fit all. XML sucks/ed for storing 3D information (VRML). I'm not even happy about HTML for that matter.

Rebol blocks are still much nicer than JSON, can do everything JSON does, and also be executed (and easier to type).

We all want one size fits all, simpler, etc. But the right tool for the right job is important, and it takes a lot of engineering to make one tool that does many things.

My favourite physical tool that only came into existence in recent years is the https://www.allfasteners.com.au/news-articles/the-unlikely-origins-of-the-oscillating-multi-tool

It changes how easily and fast I can do many things, and I use it about 30% of the time for most problems. I want more like it in fact. And have made my own bits for it to make it do even more things.

It exchanged brute force (giant blades cutting) for simply vibration. It could still be 10x better with a few more tricks (blower, vacuum, light, and gigs).

Some will recall the Roty's, and the hodge podge of poor design and implementation put into the first few years.

Red deserves a cli and gui vote window, on a block chain. Formalized a little with a Chamber or Formal discussion channel.

Conceptually a purposeful meeting at a table, with a chairperson and delegated Mr. Speaker control of the floor (like a Parliment, following Robert's Rules of Order, but looser for internets). I've been calling it BOBLAW, maybe BOBLOBLAW, for Basic Online Behaviour, Logistics and Welfare. Or something something. Anyway the goal is to provide for purposeful, legitimized decision making on motions of community business and interest. Taking place in a formally light hearted (and/or hostile) virtual environment, where everyone gets a chance to raise motions and be heard in order, following a rather strict and regimented set of rules, with frequent democratic motion votes (full table, with extended internet timelimits and \*who's in the room at the table* quorum requirements), etc.

[18:22](#msg60903f6393ac573bba806edc)Well, the simplest thing you could do IMO is replace init patterns like

```
output: clear ""

with

```
output': output    ;) save the initial index (should be /local)
output: tail output
<code here>
output: output'    ;) restoration

[18:24](#msg60997a5f98ee821821bed41a)Side note, there is a web service called NextDoor. In case you don't know it, it is a social network for people you live next to.  
Clearly it needed to happen. The format sucks, it is just another copy of everything else out there of course.  
'If you want to make an apple pie from scratch...' should be the slogan of every software company.

But, that all aside...

One small thing they do that I appreciate is they 'try' to scan your posts before you post them and help you make them better. Something I've been doing in Prolific almost since day one.

I wish Gitter did. For example 'I see you are posting about a new language, would you like to move this conversation to a thread dedicated to this?'

That, would be awesome.

NextDoor noticed I mentioned gov agencies, names of business, rude language (it got it wrong, I was LITERALLY talking about 'crap' as in sewers LOL).

[20:10](#msg609ae4bb3f08296a0297a6cc)Some notes from the guy mentioning Zig to me ( he knows of REBOL and RED, which was nice)

{Yeah, that's exactly right: the "honeymoon phase" of every project is  
the fun part. The Zig folks are very pragmatic, though, and they're not  
afraid to put nose to grindstone and do the "sucky parts". I've been  
really impressed.}

{I probably will end up doing some Go at some point just to try it out. I  
expect it to be excellent for creating Web-based backends.

I also use some command-line untilities that are written in Go, and  
they've been really good. Same with Rust.

Zig attracted me as being capable of 100% replacing C in ways that  
neither Go nor Rust can, like embedded development. I really enjoy  
low-level programming as a hobby, but every language I've learned has  
gotten me just 95% of the way there. (I could never force myself to just  
go ahead and go all-in on a project in C because it's so painfully hard  
to write correct C - there is so much undefined behavior and implicit  
behavior.)

I've jumped from language to language so many times that's really been  
quite wasteful. A great learning experience each time, yes, but not  
productive. I want to settle down with a language with NO BARRIERs,  
learn the crap out of it, and then just build stuff. :-)}

Side note, he wrote an ICS filter I used online to Lint an .ics and I reported some bugs to him in his code. He was really appreciative, and I explained some stuff we had learned about .ics files to him, so we've just been talking. His dream when he was a teen was to have an Amiga. Sadly, he was stuck with Radio Shack :(

Awe.

[18:05](#msg60ce31d8b60c3137c37facac)Exactly the questions I hope to address. As you know, we get into religion when programmers pick their tools.  
Personally, my religion only includes Programmer pain, time, and money.  
But for some it is all about philosophy, pedantics, first principles, etc.

Everything is easier in Flutter, even with less support and being early in its life.  
It is more the WAY we think and do things to start.

But, the fun here is Will and I started with React, I spent good money to build a living app, and then, threw it away because I can't argue, Flutter is better.  
We will write up answers with real examples during and after the first mini-conf.

I'm still working out what I want to do in that. It will be a mixture of what we are working on, why we are working on it, and what we are learning as we work on it.  
I have a LOT of info I want to present. But I want to keep the core event to 1h (it will be recorded)

We did a little mini-conf a while ago just to outline things (Nenad even joined) . For me, I consider such a thing a success if no one hates any of the ideas being presented LOL. We did well.

[20:51](#msg60d24d6e368d0e1d9a1ebc0b)I thought I‚Äôd try to raise a discussion about design priorities, following today‚Äôs comments by Nenad to issue #4532.

It‚Äôs interesting that while I wished for more HELPFUL error messages, Nenad focused on how ACCURATE an existing message is.

I‚Äôd rather have (let‚Äôs go completely hypothetical here) the message:

```
Math error: near SQUARE-ROOT (a / b)
```

Than:

```
Math error: cannot divide 45.973464664 by 0
```

The second message is completely ACCURATE. But the first is way more HELPFUL in finding an errant line of code in several thousand.

(Of course it‚Äôd be more helpful still if it did mention the divide by zero; and the line number in a named script file; etc. But it still gives me a better shot at finding the problem than the accurate message).

Red is a full stack language, but it sometimes seems that the stack has been loaded into a black hole ‚Äì there are very few built-in tools to debug code. My rough guess is that makes Red (as it currently stands) about 25% more expensive in developer time when debugging.

Which is a pity ‚Äì quality debugging tools are a killer app in many successful languages.

If the Red development team have usage cases in their business plan, I would hope that one of the cases is a maintenance programmer in ten years time. That person should be able to debug an ancient, legacy, Red application with ease because the debug tools are worldclass. Let‚Äôs not be PERL :)

[18:20](#msg60db647824f0ae2a2434aee3)Certainly interesting. Part of my own Funcology idea (I considered FuncUniversity, but FuncU...) is based on pattern matching, but also a corpus. So it's really more of a search and learn tool. e.g. find funcs that take two strings (`user` and `host`) and return an email address from them, or all funcs that take a `block!` and a `function!` as args to find HOFs. If the results are part of a package system, people can rate them, comment, etc. It's similar in ways, such as being able to use keywords that match in doc strings or func names.

Copy and paste coding is often derided, but it can be effective. This just automates it a bit, for those who copy other's code and not just their own.

CoPilot will open questions, and they have a lot of disclaimers in their FAQ. It has the same problem as Red/Pro will face, in that it's a service and people need to trust the company with their code. For us, the obvious way around that is an on-prem version, but if it's closed source, as a commercial product, they still have to trust you.

[18:42](#msg60db6989bef0c66d9d2f2516)In terms of value, we see the power of DSLs. Their power comes from being specific and knowing about a domain. CoPilot talks about using context, but only for a single file (so far). The interesting question for me is: What makes human programmers effective, and how do we learn? As @hiiamboris notes, it can generate boilerplate faster than a human. Autocomplete, in contrast, is concerned only with the insertion point; a single, very specific context in an expression. If the value comes from leveraging knowledge of data structures and common operations, this is perhaps the opposite of a low-code tool, where you can tweak the boilerplate, but everything is included by default.

For us, perhaps it's about the models, frameworks, and dialects we use to describe a system, from which most of the behavior (given common application needs) can be derived. I've written plenty of code generators in my time that did basically that for CRUD-oriented LOB systems.

Thus enforcing correctness at the expense of development speed, which is a good thing, but totally not possible in Red, and is too high-level for R/S.

\- API -¬†What is the future of API?  
\- Flutter -¬†Why Flutter over other frameworks?  
\- DB Truth -¬†- A different way to think about DataBases  
\- Quilt 3 - Currently a full-stack = Front end and Back end.¬† There might be something much better.

[00:01](#msg60ea34bf17929c14e67e006d)The V Programming language transpiles the code into C first. Their default C Compiler is an Open Source Tiny C Compiler TCC it is a very fast compiling cross platform C compiler. Since as I understand it the only parts compiled in a Red Compiled program is the System Code and the rest is still interpreted. So I was thinking that if the new 64 bit Red compiler started off with transpiling the Red System code to C and embedded the Red interpreter in a 64 bit TCC C program along with the transpiled C code from the System routines. It could then copy the Red source into the .exe as a resource and the compiled program could then execute the Red code as interpreted code until it can to a call to a Red System call and then the interpreter would do a callback to the compiled System function. If that would be doable then it would seem to me to limit the amount of new code that would need to be rewritten.

[09:45](#msg60eeb2577b5a415e65e5ccf3)I had a DAS Keyboard until recently, which are (or were) supposedly renowned for their mechanical keyboards. It worked ok, until the A, B and D keys started having some kind of delayed registration of a keypress, causing characters to be swapped or come in doubles. It looked to me to be a keyboard controller problem, rather than directly with the keys. There seemed to be nothing wrong mechanically with the keyboard. Nevertheless, that little thing made the keyboard insanely slow to type on, since I had to do far more corrections than usual.

I then bought an Indian RAPOO keyboard for 1/5th the price of the DAS Keyboard, and it's better than the DAS Keyboard.

I don't know if there is a point to that story, maybe except that good keyboards need to earn their reputation over years and years of abuse. Being mechanical, being made of steel and having the crisp keyboard click sound isn't enough.

greggirwin

[19:14](#msg60fc66a9926ce249e582390a)There are many ways to build games. Because they generally don't use native controls, you have more work to do. I suggest looking at @hiiamboris' \[Red-Spaces](https://gitlab.com/hiiamboris/red-spaces) project. It's still very experimental, but may give you a good starting point, rather than doing everything from scratch with `base` faces, or using images and hit testing as I believe @planetsizecpu does. It will be a great learning experience in any case.

[20:19](#msg60fc75e736b0b97fa2c759bf)@abdllhygt it's all related to moving faces and hit testing as @greggirwin said. You can check if two faces are on touch with `overlap?` word, easy in theory, but things go complex as the game grow.

planetsizecpu

[20:33](#msg60fc79083a178069da849be4)@abdllhygt I believe you could do a game like tradewinds in Red using faces, but first you'll need to learn a bit about VID &amp; View.

BaronRK

[21:42](#msg60fc893a36b0b97fa2c78114)As one that has made a lot of video games, I'm going to step in here.

It is interesting to be thinking of doing 'hit testing' (let's call this collision detection) from a graphic (or worse HTML) point of view.

This is not a VID VIEW issue, this is pure clean simple maths.

And your first check is just to see if anything is in the viewport to be rendered in the first place. After that, it is down to the most primitive/simple calculation you can make.

i.e. if (distance &lt; circle1.radius + circle2.radius) {touch, yay!}

In 2D, it is rare there is more than a dozen things actually moving around.  
And any given object only needs to do a simple test to check for collisions with the background.

But images you see on the screen don't need to have anything to do with the physics model for collision. And, you can mix and match models to get the most speed and accuracy.

Also, you can add them together. So you do a single quick check (radius) to see if you even want to do a deeper check (down to the pixel or intersecting vector lines) if need be.

greggirwin

[22:02](#msg610b0e898fc359158c52e537)Sustainability is our goal. Until you reach a critical mass, it's fantastically difficult. That's why the vast majority of "products" in this space fail. That said, we don't \*need* to reach millions. Pros and cons as your user base grows. We need X customers times Y dollars divided by team salaries - minus cost of developing stuff that doesn't pay. It's not a huge number by any means, but still large enough that it rarely works out.

Another possible approach is to find a patron, as \[Cognitext did with NuBank](https://cognitect.com/blog/2020/07/23/Cognitect-Joins-Nubank). For that to happen, we need to grow and have value in their eyes. If Clojure didn't run on Java, they \*may* have turned out to be just another Lisp. Go and Rust came at it from the inside. But you still have to sell it to your employer and keep selling them. e.g., Dart is still alive, but lives deep in Go's shadow now. If not for Flutter, my guess is that it would have been retired.

That brings us to the third leg of the stool: a killer app. Spin the wheel, roll the dice, say a prayer. You can't force or predict them.

So commercial products are the plan. We have 2 openings and can justify a third if the fit is right. Paying in crypto is also a blessing and a curse, but that's where we are right now (for the most part).

Compare the size of %string.reds and %integer.reds in the viz. They look the same to me, but one file is 70K and the other is 18K. Not to criticize this project, but the fact that there are granularity issues we face for human presentation. What information we gain in one facet we may lose in another. When I looked at it earlier, one of my first thoughts was what it would look like as a treemap. Does anyone know if there's a tool that does that? Time to revisit Edward Tufte's work.

greggirwin

[18:13](#msg6127d9c6fd7409696ed98f35)I've written a number of code generators in the past. We don't generate C as a back end with Red because then you depend on them, and they are often large and complex (GCC, clang, etc.). The leading alt back end target right now is LLVM, but that's also a lot of work and we have to weigh the value.

abdllhygt

[18:25](#msg6127dca55739ab2df8bc6e60)but a generator can make faster development of red, not? and c is already main lang of computers.

greggirwin

[18:28](#msg6127dd674c7be06b79843090)It really just pushes problems around. It doesn't solve them. And while we may consider it, or others may do it, it doesn't fit with the idea of reducing complexity overall. We also have to ask \*why* C is still dominant, what it was designed for, and what it's used for.

abdllhygt

[18:40](#msg6127e03399b7d97528d757d0)the question of c is large, we are talking about smaller things, like why red doesn't have a 64bit compiler. i think red should have a framework like flutter for living. it can be with a generator or like a raylib binding.

[19:17](#msg6127e8d67cd57813a88fccf6)Ah, I see, thanks. This raises an important question. Note that we've moved to D2D, and will move to SSE. These are modern, fundamental elements in Windows and CPUs respectively. Flutter, however, is likely to come and go like other transient technologies. So the better way to integrate with it (and Flutter is on our radar, make no mistake, as is Material Design) is for someone to champion it, and then let us know when something is needed in Red to facilitate interop. We can't afford to follow too many trends, but have to choose them carefully, regarding what will help Red succeed.

[19:34](#msg6127ecb467e789189cc44482)Glancing at Flutter I found https://flutter.dev/docs/perf/app-size, which has a treemap view for app contents, which aligns with what @zentrog:matrix.org was talking about recently. Cool idea. It makes me wonder if there's a way to blend the ideas of 2D/viz and sorted columnar data that leverages both. Some researcher must have done that somewhere. Navigating a new world/project/system is \*hard\*. A single view may not be enough, but the ability to switch between 2 or 3 of them that are each tailored for a specific mode of learning the landscape.

@BaronRK might have thoughts, based on his knowledge of dead reckoning, and @toomasv or @GalenIvanov might be interested in how pathing through diagrams or simulation explorations apply to this. For example, if we have a universal system navigator, could it apply to file systems, code cross references, data structures, and distributed systems? If we track and collect the paths people take, what can we learn from that? Can we draw a diagram that highlights paths others have taken (shortcuts)? "I see you're coming from S, here are paths others have taken from there, and those that spent time at a destination (meaning they found what they wanted, rather than backtracking and going somewhere else) ended up at Z." Sort of like a Recently Used list, but showing the connections.

Or maybe a search feature where, like Everything or grep, your file view narrows things down, but a treemap would highlight the boxes where a result occurs, maybe with a badge for the number of occurrences.

[19:34](#msg6127ecddfd7409696ed9bba9)D2D is for Windows only. Every platform has its own back end.

[19:38](#msg6127eda65cfd665e52f01eb2)On dead reckoning, my mind must have thought about the \[Path Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path\_integration) attribute.

[19:42](#msg6127eeb37cd57813a88fd994)Is there a browser extension that tracks your back/forward moves, so you can see a map of that?

BaronRK

[20:52](#msg6127ff2ad206b85e4f653db0)You're hitting on the core issue, one view of data is so 2020.

For example, what is the difference between a report, and dashboard, and therefore, UI itself?

What is the difference between Search, and Filter?

There are differences, but should there be?

Why can't reports be Printer TO Calendars?

Assuming temporal data, or even not. A real example is if you have a list of tasks, no exact dates or even times. Still, it can be displayed on a calendar in terms of assigning each task 1h, and filling the calendar 8 hours a day. This is useful.

TreeMaps rock over pie charts in many places. Even for a calendar. Seeing your days as equal is silly. For example Sun might be very thin. That would tell you way more.

[21:00](#msg612800d999b7d97528d7a5b7)@zentrog:matrix.org yeah, TreeMap is a sucky name. I use them, and can never remember their name. I think a better name would be like VolumeGrid.

The other report graphing name I can't remember is the one that makes lines of different thicknesses from node to node. These should be called Raceways (just like the things used to carry wires).

greggirwin

[22:57](#msg61296df167e789189cc79adb)I think what @rebolek meant is to transpile from R/S to C, rather than generating C from Red. Transpiling is a somewhat modern term for tranlating/compiling to a language that is roughly the same abstraction level. e.g. from Typescript to Javascript. Since R/S and C are both low level system languages, translating from one to the other is generally much easier than a high level to low level compiler.

[10:02](#msg612a09ccfd7409696ede28b1)@greggirwin thanks, that's what I menat. @abdllhygt tranlsating Red/System code to C is much simpler than translating Red to C. And because when you are compiling Red, it gets translated to R/S anyway, once you have R/S-&gt;C transpiler, you get Red-&gt;C transpiler for free.

[10:06](#msg612a0a945cfd665e52f4aace)Could such a scenario help the transition to the 64 bit support? I mean - with C compilation, you can select new targets, configurations, etc., but would such scenario support that, or R/S itself would have to support 64 bit in itself?

rebolek

[10:09](#msg612a0b651179346966e7a53f)If you have this transpiler, you can build 32bit version for 64bit OS. But to get full 64bit support, you need some fundamental changes in Red.

[10:10](#msg612a0b8c67e789189cc8c3f3)I.e. you could build Red for newer macOS, but integers would still be 32bit.

How they have not worked out how to do this is just really disgusting. Hardware should self identify and allow self-testing.

Software should know what is allowed and keep it automatically updated.

I spent the day yesterday with two of my former team. We hiked, ate, and talked, for 8 solid hours catching up. They are both leads at Apple, one is in charge of Sec, other is Art. I gave both of them their first jobs in the business.

They are done. Meaning: fed up there. It is sad. I'm actually a fan of Apple (even though I don't like their products personally). meaning, I'm actually unbiased. I want them to win (I want everyone to win for the most part).

I often note (and this group perhaps they can recognise this) America has become more like England, and England more like America over the past 100 years.

[01:36](#msg61414e215cfd665e52269829)I concur with @BaronRK . However, I would be extremely surprised if it had any benefit. I find that due to a person's foundational worldview and related confirmation bias, those chit-chat2 style discussions are rarely productive and most often divisive. There are a sparse few who are willing to look past their assumptions of what is true about reality and discuss with an open mind the merits and folly of any of those ideas. But those few are drowned out by the cacophony of the far more common parrots, the poseurs, and the intellectually lazy or incompetents. And don't even mention the trolls.

[21:17](#msg615a1e03fb8ca0572b9fed71)@gltewalt Fun list. :+1:

also: Perhaps the most clever piece of Redbol code ever. @giesse came up with it, but outside a few cases I think it makes code much harder to understand.

alter: Came up in R2 times, and needs to be addressed (https://github.com/red/red/issues/3190). We should address this before more time passes.

as: Strictly for special case optimizations, though I've thought about how it could be extended to do more. Another word I've used in the past is `cast` to mold one type into another.

decode-url: we don't have the obvious use case in Red yet, but it existed in Rebol. Given a URL you can decode it into a spec, which you can then easily alter for use with ports. The question comes up about why `url!` values don't just have accessors. It's because URLs are not fully parse according to their RFC. For efficiency's sake, they are only lexed enough to classify them by the characters they can contain.

ellipsize-at: Think of how often you see "read more" or "see more". This is part of `help` today, but I think it's more generally useful than that.

exists-thru? and read-thru: All `*-thru` funcs came from the Rebol idea of a basic, user-controlled cache. It existed mainly for use with the Rebol desktop, which is another tool we don't have yet. `thru` needs some thinking, because Rebol only had one, and Red uses `system/options` for it today. That means it's shared "per system" (not per OS setup), so different sets of Red apps can each have their own cache. That's great, but also means a module and package system will be duplicated, and that's where caching could be the most useful.

extract: I was surprised how much I used this in R2. I have old mezzanines, which we also want to consider in the HOF space, for extracting by name. e.g. you have objects or keyed blocks and want `index` to be a name rather than an offset. This also ties somewhat to reflection, which is always a \[fun discussion](https://github.com/red/REP/issues/68).

flip-exe-flag: This is fun because of the body. Talk about magic numbers. :^)

help-string: I'm anxious to see how we extend reflective ideas as we write more tools.

immediate?: Same as for all other type queries, but typesets are one of the things about Red that \*almost* aligns with how OOP people think. How I think of typesets in Red is very different than OOP interfaces or inheritance. Much more how we group things as humans.

scan: A great example of how important helper funcs can be. It's a good name that makes the intent clear. I wonder if the doc string needs fixing. It says "guessed type" but it should be "recognized type" if `/fast` isn't used.

swap: Related to `swap` and `move`, I have old `shift` and `rotate` funcs, which operate on series, which were very handy in some cases. For `rotate` you can do it now with `move` to be more efficient than `take+insert` . e.g.

```
rotate: function [
	"Rotate values in a series."
	series [series!]
	/left   "Rotate left (default)"
	/right  "Rotate right"
	/part
		count [number!] "Rotate this many positions"
][
	if empty? series [return series]
	; modulo the count against the series size
	count: any [all [count  count // length? series] 1]
	;if zero? count [return series]	; MOVE handles a zero /part correctly
	head either right [
		move/part (skip tail series negate count) series count
	][
		move/part series tail series count
	]
]
```

I haven't rewritten `shift`, but now that Red has a native one for bitsets, it will be more work to do in R/S.

transcode: Controlled loading. So much power.

I will add `unless` to your list as well. When we start collecting more than reference docs and basic examples (as red-by-example does, falling under ref's IMO), we'll have a lot of rich language discussions.

greggirwin

[19:10](#msg618c193bd3ae402e479ed1e6)Their summary about what it is:

```
Htmx extends and generalizes the core idea of HTML as a hypertext, opening up many more possibilities directly within the language:

- Now any element, not just anchors and forms, can issue an HTTP request
- Now any event, not just clicks or form submissions, can trigger requests
- Now any HTTP verb, not just GET and POST, can be used
- Now any element, not just the entire window, can be the target for update by the request
```

@gltewalt:matrix.org "worth it" for what?

It's been around since 2014, and has ~5K stars on github (about the same as Red, coincidentally).

A key point they make is that the "calls" will likely return HTML, not JSON, so it's not really about APIs in the normal sense. In the sense that functions are like APIs, then yes, it's about triggering a request and getting a result, with that result being applied implicitly. That is, rather than getting data as a result and then doing something with it, the result immediately gets "merged" into the global state (the DOM).

What I'm missing is where the \*rest* of the state comes from. If all the information for the call is based on the HTML element attributes, how do you send data. Yes, it adds options for making HTML server requests, but they don't say \*why* or \*when* to use it. They do note HATEOAS as the foundational model, so my take is that it is "more event triggers" and declarative application of the result. That may have a lot of value for web devs. I can't say. But it strikes me as another case of pushing something (HTML and links) into an area it wasn't designed for. But I can also see cases for it. They don't have full examples that I see, but I can think of at least one specific model of UI where it might help.

Seems designed to work well with the author's other project: https://hyperscript.org/

[19:31](#msg618c1e2aee6c260cf76f77ef)I really, really don't want to have a web front-end for my back-office software, but I also need the interface to run on many different platforms, from tablets to phones to desktops (primarily Windows and Linux) to SBCs. Red isn't at the point to offer this in the near future, from what I can tell, so we're going to have to move forward with a web front-end on our rewrite. Our back-office software was developed in 2003 in R2/View and has gone through a number of revisions, with the latest major revision coming in 2014. I've been putting off the rewrite for a few years while giving Red a chance to mature more, but we can't put it off any longer. At this point, not rewriting it is costing us every day in lost productivity. That's the long way around to saying that tools such as htmx and hyperscript may be useful in our project.

[22:26](#msg618c47003f09d85736670796)@Respectech I have stopped my projects too because Grid View, DB, and Connectivity are a very high priority to me. While Ports are coming and I can use SQL Server with Munge, Grid View is a major issue. But as I want to be a man of solution and not a man of complaints, I can say the following:  
1\) I can replace Android Tablet with Windows ones. I have already purchased many second hand Dell Venue where Red GUI is fully working and can do most of the work.  
2\) I can use SQL Server with ODBC, yes, it is not open source but you can purchase a full working old version for few bucks and use Munge and ODBC. Then we could wait for MySQL: @rebolek is keeping a secret which is now no more a secret because you are leaving and it is an emergency situation: he has already made some experiments with a conncter for this DB engine. He has a great experience as he has created Redis interface and his secure Red server has good progress. Also Ports will be released in december/january.  
3\) Grid view: last year nothing was created but now @hiiamboris has a made a great work with RedSpaces, a project created to develop Red native styles using Draw. Also a Pinky demo thas shows a draw based Grid  
So, it is not 2019 anymore, we are in 2021 and 65% of work has been done, we miss the remaining 35%.  
I think the experience of creating new back-office software for your company, could give Red a boost towards the completion of those parts. I suppose you could recuperate the momentary productivity loss in the future, where you could benefit from all the past experience you on Rebol in Red (which is 98% Rebol), and all the skill your company has. I think Red, represented here by @greggirwin will keep great attention to this situation as the needings of companies like yours are the winds a software company should ride to reach top levels.  
So, apart from those mentioned, which features are you missing in Red?

I just have to find a different front-end as I cannot require all my employees to carry Windows tablets around with them. However, they all already have Android phones with them at all times.

I already have a solution for Red and MySQL: That is, to use R3 as the MySQL intermediary and communicate with Red. I was going to have a MySQL intermediary anyway as I wanted robust logging and custom clustering capabilities.

What I am missing at this point is the ability to compile Red with GUI for different OSes on different architectures, which is why I believe a browser is perhaps the only good solution. A recent implementation of our back-office software was done in 2014 using R3 as the server side and browser as the front-end, so it isn't much different than that.

[06:31](#msg618cb8ddfb8ca0572b15f98a)I remember Carl once telling me something like - why ppl did not swith to R3 already, it is internally so much better than R2. My answer was easy - ppl wanted their DB schemes, shell acces, easy library access, nice console, etc. So in fast, R3 was far from being on-par with R2 and provided ppl with little incentive to switch over.

I can see similar scheme with Red, and no, it is not a complaint, just an observatin. We can see ppl here or ther asking for 64 bit, IO and grid-view. Accelerated GUI might be nice, but if ppl are missing a grid view to display a columnar data, then it might be problematic to most. Remember - only a skilled person can write a grid-view, but it could be used by many. And yes, I can imagine (well, maybe I even can't), how hard work it might be to get to 64 bit.

So - I think above 3 priorities might not be far from top3 community wishes. Pity it does not seem to align with the Red Team priorities, or so it seems without me actually having access to any Red Team internals. Once again - it is an observation, not a complaint.

[07:57](#msg618cccdfd78911028a30bcc3)@Respectech, @GiuseppeChillemi I wonder, if SQL servery like MS SQL, mySQL have a command line tool too? I do remember one of the R2 SQLite drivers, called something like "a poor man's driver", which basically called a sqlite.exe and parsed out the result using `call`. I think, while not being ideal, it still could kind of work. Because, and in my opinion - the exchange interface is not going to be a bottleneck. Most of the heavy lifting is going to be done on SQL server side anyway.

[07:59](#msg618ccd7738377967f4a662d8)As for the frontend, we would need either the VID-2-x converter, or full WASM Red release, but I am not sure how/if WASM is ever used in an online world effectively and supported by a mobile browsers?

[08:14](#msg618cd0eb98c13e75502b1851)@pekr Munge uses SQLCMD and it does to SQL Server what "ppor man's driver" does to sqlite.exe, so yes, it could be a solution.

[09:13](#msg618cdeae29ddcd029376fe16)What I really will love would be a native DB dialect, giving the fact that Red is a dialect power it seems the next logical step, I recall some word from @greggirwin on that direction.

Just as an one minute example of what I mean:

```
needs 'dbconn
.
db: DB_conn/mysql ["orders" "passwd" 3306]
if none? db [alert "DB Error" quit]
.
result_set: []
append result_set db/select [cus_name, cus_last_name from "customers" where cus_last_name like "Smith"]
either empty? result_set [
	print "No records"
][
	print result_set
]

Oldes

[09:38](#msg618ce4b2a41fd20699384292)@planetsizecpu writing own SQL syntax in a nonsense... you are just reinventing a wheel. I think that better is to use the mentioned preprepared statements... it could be used with my extension like:

```
;- prepare resusable sql statement for getting list of customers...
customers-with-last-name!: prepare db "SELECT cus_name, cus_last_name FROM customers WHERE cus_last_name LIKE ?"
;-- use it in custom function...
all-customers-with-last-name: func[name [string!]][
	; step collects all rows if not specified limit
	step/with db customers-with-last-name! reduce [name]
	; I should probably allow single value and not require `reduce` above
]

; list all customers with the last name Smith
probe all-customers-with-last-name "Smith"
; or who has last name starting with S
probe all-customers-with-last-name "S%"

I can't believe we are all talking about widgets still (30+ years)

It is clear what all the small widgets are (radio, checkbox, etc.) and yet these are still amorphous, and still missing things:

\- Still want a standard Rotate button (like Amiga). This is even more useful with mobile touch interfaces. I want to tap, and go to next option all the time all over the place.

\- 2D menus, why are vertical single lists inside small windows that require scroll bars even legal?

\- Filter list - no LIST should ever be presented without a filter (search even) at the top. Gmail still does not offer this when selecting a Label, you are forced to scroll down through hundreds of words. INSANE.

Moving up to a higher level:

\- Grid view, or simley a dynamic Table: columns that can be sorted, grabbed vertically or horizontally, exported to CSV, printed, by default.

\- List to List boxes

\- File management

etc.

We all use the same stuff over and over again, and yet everyone has to roll their own. INSANE.

1\) Keeping the FLWOR model in mind when designing HOFs and the markup codec. C# calls it LINQ (Language Integrated Query). I don't see it being standard, but an optional module.

2\) A simple native record manager. Not a full blown DB, but the core of one. Just the data, indexes for speed, and a small and simple ISAM-like API. I have done some tinkering on this. This is something that could be optional, but I think it's worth making standard. One reason being that we can create APIs that work either against local or remote datastores, as well as syncing entire datasets or subsets of them.

I also think there is value in having a dead simple SQLite option for those who want it.

BaronRK

[19:12](#msg618d6b0cd3ae402e47a1bd98)This gets to the heart of it:

\- One might ink of a DBs scheme and usage pattern as a goal. NEVER CONFUSE GOALS AND TASKS.  
\- When you start, there are lots of changes. But the system lets you do that. EASY TO PROTOTYPE,  
\- Over time things calm down, and the system helps you by reworking how things are stored, building key index lists, etc. IT CONSTANTLY FIXES ITSELF.  
\-

greggirwin

[19:22](#msg618d6d5efb8ca0572b1791e8)By being able to hook functions, back to instrumentation here, you can add higher level tools that track calls (HOFs and aggregates used here), notice what fields are queried or iterated over the most, and dynamically modify the rules so new indexes are added.

Schemas can be supported at a higher level as well. There are always tradeoffs. We can use blocks/maps/objects as the store elements, and do everything dynamically. It's less efficient, but is \*great* for simplicity and data longevity.

[19:31](#msg618d6f9f29ddcd0293785509)@BaronRK totally agreed that every list should be filterable.

planetsizecpu

[20:49](#msg618d81d6fb3dcd4e887f0552)Thanks for the insigths Gregg, a ISAM record manager is a great tool, same as SQLite. My thoughts where in the big data direction, concurrent access, etc. We would need tools to figure on that picture IMO.

[15:48](#msg619d0d56197fa95a1c88db67)Difficult to explain, when I know about OpenWRT just from screenshots. For me, it is a complete ecosystem. I can upgrade devices from ROS 2.x to the newest 6.x. All devices, including switches, use one system. Winbox console, mobile management apps, scriptable, you can see each packet going thru rules, so you actually know, if it works, or not. But also - MT is behind in wi-fi area, no wi-fi6 support yet, etc. I can configure home device the same way as a corporate CCR router, which we use for the 700+ of our wi-fi clients.

OTOH some ppl find the Winbox interface being complicated. So for the home users, there are Tenda, Dlink, Tplink cheapo devices, easy settable as a mesh. Some ppl prefer Ubiquiti radios, because nice apple like management interface. Depends upon what you really need.

Respectech

[15:57](#msg619d0f81197fa95a1c88e148)That sounds good. From what I understand about OpenWRT, it uses the same interface across devices and is also upgradable. I'm not sure how granular the packet filtering is on OpenWRT.

What I want (literally right now) is a 'simple' way to plug a thumbdrive into an existing Amiga and treat it like a harddrive.

By 'Simple' I mean: just plug it into an existing port. Best would be the D23 Drive port, so it just thinks it is a big drive. Thus, in theory, no software needed.

The PAR port on the Amiga was bidrectional, and could do impressive speed if I recall.

It is strange to me this is not a common device.

It also speaks to the failure of standards to solve this long standing problem.  
We need a way that survives into the future.  
Epson did this with their printers.  
There is (was?) a MODE you can ask of an Espson that is basically: Take this DUMP of B&amp;W data and shove it into your internal buffer and print it.  
You just needed to know the Width and Height as I recall.  
This meant you did NOT need an actual print driver to print to the Epson.  
Just send raw data out to the PAR (or SER) port and it would just do the expected thing with it.

Looking forward to MMXXII

[total side story. I'm sure many here that speak multiple languages, or interact with more than one culture, can relate.

When we had a brick and mortar, we had a Pun of the Day award. To acquire this award (have it on your desk, since it could be won by someone else later) you had to use a pun in such a way that someone noticed it, and also, someone did NOT notice it. This cut down on the number of puns, and, improved the quality of them. I've always enjoyed this concept of duality. As I lived in many places, including UK, US, AU, and NZ, I've always enjoyed the rare times when I can say something in English that hold no meaning to one person, but a great deal of meaning to another. And so it was, that one day on a hike in the US one of our group invited their professor to join us. They wanted us to meet. He turned out to be of the pompous Cambridge genus, and so, accordingly, I would pepper my replies to him with subtle British colloquialisms and turns of phrase that all who heard me would not register for what it was, as I also would say it in a tone not matched to it's usual usage, but that he heard loud and clear. Yes, I was being an ahole. But he started it (the British always start it). At the very end, as we were all leaving, and people were saying their goodbyes, I added my goodbyes, with smiles, and waves, 'and good riddance' - to which the look on his face was quite priceless. He did not return for future hikes. Hey, we all need hobbies]

The key is an integer from 1 to 25.

This cipher rotates (either towards left or right) the letters of the alphabet (A to Z).

The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A).
So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC".

But that doesn't tell me much, does it? What exactly failed in that mess of expressions?

Turns out I can answer that:

```

          s                         => "x"                                  
        find a s/1                  => true                                 
              s                     => "x"                                  
            x: % s/1 32             => #"^X"                                
          k                         => -25

*** Math Error: math or number overflow
*** Where: +
*** Stack: buggy-caesar
```

Okay! Now I see that `(x: s/1 % 32)` is `#"^"X`:

```
>> to 1 #"^X"
== 24
```

And I'm adding `k = -25` to it, which overflows it before we reach `+ 25` part. So what if I put `+ 25` before `+ k`?

```

It's fixed now yay!

[19:45](#msg61ccbad45ee4df335abc8030)Yeah, it's more for golfing. Not very good for Rosetta.

[19:45](#msg61ccbaec5ee4df335abc804f)Though if you add labels before each sub-expression.. :)

[07:38](#msg61cd62105dc6213cd4b928ac)Ah Y2K38, I would be retired (I wonder if alive) but I hope to see it working. I would like to see the 128 bit computers age too.

I have once commented with my daughter (who studies maths and telematics degree) that she will surely be able to handle 256-bit computers in the distant future, as I had the chance with 8/16/32/64 bit machines üòè

[08:00](#msg61cd671246529077f55daf7c)I am not sure it makes much sense to go beyond 64 bit world. Maybe CPUs will use some wliv principle (RISC-V) or we will see some leap in quantum computers area. Last week I have read an article about some quantom advancements, where the whole movie era would be stored in a storage the size of a sugar lump :-)

planetsizecpu

[09:38](#msg61cd7e07526fb77b31557a0b)Well I hope we can see those advances in stores. By now we already know that there are 256 and 512 bit wide bus graphics cards, so who knows. How about a 256 bit OS and Red 4.0 ? üòÑ

[15:45](#msg61cdd41f526fb77b315618dc)@pekr 1g of DNA should be able to store about 2 petabytes of data: https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/g201312/storage-capacity-of-dna/

[15:46](#msg61cdd45cbfe2f54b2ef44072)IBM also has recently made an advancement in chip design where they stack transistors vertically as well as horizontally. This is supposed to increase performance and reduce power consumption by a significant amount.

[16:21](#msg61cddc85526fb77b31562ab9)One of my tenants is a chip engineer at Nvidia. He builds error correcting hardware from the inside out.

It is truly fascinating how chips are made now, on par with an entire aircraft carrier of thousands of engineers, and support staff. Truly amazing.

[18:57](#msg61ce01315dc6213cd4ba53ad)&gt; I am not sure it makes much sense to go beyond 64 bit world.

Someone else once said

&gt; 640K should be enough for anyone.

Well, I don't know if he really said it, but I do remember him saying at a conference (this was the early 90s) was "I have 256M of RAM in my computer at work, but nothing can use it all." I think that's what we'll see in the future too.

For Red, and for hardware, I think it means more disparity and more types of systems. Imagine a "1 bit" IoT device. Just sensors that "set" it to an on/off state that can be accessed. 8-bit devices that do something similar, but the 8 bits are interpreted as 0-100% (using the last 27 for metadata). 32-bits is far more than enough for swarms of very capable agents.

Old systems sometimes had things like 11-bit words. The point being that things can be "right sized" as needed. If the smallest thing you can represent is 256 bits, every 1-bit value wastes 255 of them, and that's at the native level. HLLs, and things like Red datatypes will "waste" much more. (lots of quotes, I know) So we can get value \*from* them, but pay in a different way. We are still deeply aware of bitness when we write code. Someone always has to be, but picture a day where you write some code, lay out metadata that says how much data it needs to handle and, given examples, how fast it has to process it. Fire up the constraint solver compiler, and it gives you a list of hardware options and their tradeoffs. From there, you select the target, it builds for that (ordering the hardware if it's an embedded system), and the fully automated system burns the chips and runs the tests you spec'd.
