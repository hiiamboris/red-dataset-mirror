[22:14](#msg5ffe1f56d5f4bf2965e1890b)In 2018, the red language group started at about US $1000. The price of ICO's red token is about US $0.25. I would like to ask you why the price of Ethereum's red token is still about US $0.002. Can you tell the investors where and how to use the ETH raised by ICO at that time?

[22:16](#msg5ffe1fc2787d8f79c8fa650e)Don't answer what I said about value investment. I don't approve of short-term speculation. As an investor, I have the right to care about where my money is spent. Do you think I'm asking too much?

[22:26](#msg5ffe22205562a61e9aa03820)For those who missed our sales, the token sales process took place from January 8th to January 31st 2018, in three stages:

\- Private Investors (Jan 8th - Jan 11th): 1 ETH =&gt; 3400 RED  
\- Early Birds (Jan 12th - Jan 15th): 1 ETH =&gt; 2750 RED  
\- Open round (Jan 16th - Jan 31th): 1 ETH =&gt; 2500 RED  
The total amound of RED created will be allocated in the following manner:

\- Red Foundation: 35% (70,000,000 RED)  
\- Red Team: 15% (30,000,000 RED) with a 12 months lockup period.  
\- Private Investors: 10% (20,000,000 RED) with a 3 months lockup period, unlocked on May 1st 2018.  
\- Open Sales (earlybird + open rounds): 30% (60,000,000 RED)  
\- Marketing/Strategic: 10% (20,000,000 RED)  
The total amount RED sold was 28137 ETH. We will use the ETH for the following purposes:

\- 60% for team recruitment and operations in Hong-Kong and San Francisco offices.  
\- 20% for RED token sales expenses.  
\- 10% for marketing operations.  
\- 10% for outsourced software developments.

Those allocations will change depending on the conversion ratio of ETH with fiat money.

We are working on building Red software stack since many years and have a solid tech community to support it. Now that we have the funds to develop Red further, we are expanding the teams and can push Red further than ever. Red is there to stay and continue growing.

We are so grateful, more than we can say, to have such a supportive (and growing) community around us. On behalf of the entire RED team, I want to share our appreciation for you all, and I personally want to thank each of you for loving and believing in Red.  
To Red's future, our future!

[17:53](#msg5fff3387252c0a6ded0a80fa)&gt; I would like to ask you why the price of Ethereum's red token is still about US $0.002.

How can we know? We have no control over the state of crypto fluctuations beyond what we do with Red to bring value to RED tokens.

&gt; Can you tell the investors where and how to use the ETH raised by ICO at that time?

Just as we said in the message you quoted:

&gt; ...develop Red further, we are expanding the teams and can push Red further than ever.

Along with things @9214 nicely detailed last November, the progress page we linked to in various messages, and all the public chat here on Gitter. This is where we direct people who ask on Telegram as well. In addition to the public rooms we have private rooms, and other channels we use for internal development chat.

If you haven't seen in the main rooms, we released a tool called DiaGrammar, which is a huge milestone for us. v1 doesn't have sharing features, but those are planned. We have a long list of tool and product ideas, and collaboration aspects are always considered from a blockchain perspective as well.

In DiaGrammar's case, grammars are at the core, and can be used for languages, data formats, APIs, and even protocols and business processes to some extent. Say your business depends on any of those, or if you work with another company and you depend on \*their* language or data format. If you put those specifications on the blockchain (more realistically as hash or checksum of the specification), you can start long term development against that spec, including writing legal and programmatic contracts knowing that it won't change out from under you without somebody knowing and being accountable. That doesn't solve all the problems of course, it's just one piece of it, but it can be an important one.

[06:13](#msg5fffe0f65562a61e9aa48ea8)If the price of the red token continues to maintain this price, most people will not be able to buy the red token, because the service charge for cash withdrawal to the wallet is too high, and ordinary users will not be able to pay such a high service charge for cash withdrawal, because the price of Ethereum is too high compared with the red token.

[17:49](#msg600084174498e01bbfa9b4e7)All we can control is the Red technology that we \*hope* will add value to RED, but even that is not a guarantee. We \*cannot* control anything related to the price of RED beyond that, and certainly not things like exchange service charges.

[01:52](#msg602099625500a97f82f2c813)Hey, friends, can you think of a way to make red token work?

greggirwin

[04:13](#msg6020ba5055359c58bf2c1a18)Until Red/C3 is available you would have to write in Solidity, or Vyper if it works for you, as with any other token.

15926222352

[06:09](#msg6020d5b29238c531ad3017a1)When will red / C3 be officially available? @greggirwin

greggirwin

[19:13](#msg60218d519fa6765ef807ee63)We will certainly post here when it is. You've probably noticed that we don't generally pre-announce delivery dates.

[07:48](#msg60e40ac7effd491d8ca24d81)Hey folks! I’ve started to learn Red again recently and found one interesting statement here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12sTu7RT-s\_QlAupY1v-3DfI1Mm9NEX5YMWWTDAKHLfc/edit#gid=0

\*A very concise notation, with great combining power. Special attention is paid to producing Crypto contracts*

Is there any info about producing crypto contacts? I’m very interested in an alternative to solidity (both creating and using)

[08:37](#msg60e4164e24f0ae2a2447018f)As well as targeting some other runtimes, as Cardano’s Plutus, which I believe can be pretty easily generated

greggirwin

[17:27](#msg60e492819cf3171730132101)I hadn't seen that sheet. Nice find @tmphei:matrix.org. It's not quite accurate about Red though. Red/System is the system level language while C3, in development, is the blockchain DSL. Some other infrastructure pieces needed to be done before continuing on C3, but we'll make announcements soon on a new roadmap.

[01:21](#msg61356d3599b7d97528f41dbd)RED works like any other ETH token. If you use a Ledger device, Ledger Live is good.

[20:45](#msg61c8d4799a33545406f286c1)I feel nostalgic after remembering the post about Red and blockchain back around Xmas of 2017.

[20:45](#msg61c8d47d526fb77b314d657e)What is the situation regarding Red/C3 ?

[18:50](#msg61ca0adfe1a1264f0a2a885e)We'll have a blog post out soon that talks about our roadmap. The plan is to revive C3, near the top of our priority list, but Q4 delayed a few other tasks.
