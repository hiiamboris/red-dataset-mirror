[12:00](#msg633588f6443b7927a738a20c)Hi! What is the status of RED token? How can I buy some? Is buying it (and raising price) helpful to the project in general, or only to Red/C3 and DAO? What will be a usecase for the tokens in the future, do you plan to use it as governance tokens or something else? All plans made during ICO in 2017/2018 still hold?

I have a plan to offer some RED tokens as a part of reward in my project crowdfunding on Patreon. What do you think about it?
