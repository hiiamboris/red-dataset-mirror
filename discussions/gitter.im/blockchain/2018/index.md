&gt;I am not 100% sure where does your project value proposition stand. On the crypto side you'll need to deal with many exchange API, including ICO platforms, hardware and software wallets.

The value proposition is, that it's using Red :smile:  
No bloat, fast, light on resources, cross-platform, easy updates, stable and fast data feeds, integration of various brokers/exchanges, multi-asset, wallets, possibility to changed everything from UI, logic, plugins in an easy, flexible and human readable form.

There are some existing and upcoming exchanges, which support various exchanges, ICOs, hardware and software wallets. But sure, the API fragmentation is a problem, that's, why I want to use services, which don't go this route but an open, free and a common protocol/interface.  
As long as there is an open API, there is the possibility of an integration. It needs more work, but doable. Plugins are easy and natural with Red.

&gt;Sounds like a job for an open source project. If you'd like to be the Bloomberg of crypto then integrate news.

The idea of implementing something like this was born, after I searched for trading platforms, which are Open Source and offer the same features as the common free/commercial ones. Well, there was not really one. The majority of the platforms have their UI stuck in the 90ties, have wrong or inflexible implementations of time-independent chart-types, are bloated, slow or inflexible.  
Yes, this maybe some job for an open source project.

&gt;Such Red open source layer covering the scope of crypto space, connecting exchanges and wallets, would turn Red into a major contender in becoming blockchain lingua franca.

Not only the crypto space. It should be a multi-asset platform, which is secure, flexible, fast, non-bloated, easy extendable, nice looking and easy adaptable for everyone and every asset class.

&gt;Such library can justify a Red coin reward sized to incentivize contribution.

Yes, I'm really curious about the C3 project and the coin rewards. A trading software like this would need a lot of components like charts, DSLs for trading and indicators/strategies, wallets (software and hardware), easy code sharing, trade copying and much more.

[17:01](#msg5a4a6952b48e8c35668a7fa2)If those who know this domain well would like to start a wiki page, that would be great. Knowing what the biggest pain points are, what features are most needed, etc. is helpful. The core team already knows a lot of this, as they've done their homework before deciding to go this direction, but if we can leverage domain expertise, that's what Red is all about.

BeardPower

[15:02](#msg5a4e41eb0163b02810b0760a)@dockimbel There are platforms to launch one's ICO campaign. They take care of whitepapers, marketing, wallets, tokens, contracts, KYC, AML, audits, token distribution and so on.

[01:09](#msg5a4ed0450cef4fed2ebeedd9)@BeardPower Just curious, could you list some of those platforms?

BeardPower

[03:12](#msg5a4eed1aedd22308111416e0)@x8x sure. There are some, which are having their own ICO at the moment. Prices are not cheap ;-)  
I will use a quote:

&gt;The ICO process does not require a platform in the SaaS sense at all. It is, however, a collection of service assets that support the increasingly complex ICO process which is becoming very difficult to navigate successfully for both the advisor and the founding team with a great project. And yes I have come across some amazing projects unlocked by the genius concept of the Token itself.

https://coinlaunch.co/  
https://tokenmarket.net/ico-professional-services  
https://icobench.com/services  
https://icobox.io/  
https://cryptorated.com/icopedia/top-platforms-for-launching-an-ico/

Maybe there is some value for the Red ICO in these links :smile:

[03:20](#msg5a4eeeeab48e8c3566a080be)As you can read, some are just calling those the "platform": Ethereum , Waves, Nxt, Bitshares, NEM, etc. and the service companies calle their products ICO "platforms", because of their one-stop ICO services.

It's very hard for US residents to participate in ICOs because of strict regulations. Most ICOs do not care about this, and get into big problems afterwards.

CryptoGaston\_twitter

[09:33](#msg5a5097cdce68c3bc7485727a)@PeterWAWood The organization DOES have “an idea of the nationality.” Some ICOs use geolocation to block US Citizens. Yes, it can be bypassed if someone was really determined... but generally, the token issuer makes an assessment regarding their token sales ability to comply with US law and proceeds one way or the other. ICOs are not “forbidden” in the US, but if the token is considered a security, additional steps need to be taken by the issuer before US citizens can buy. This is way more nuanced than you’re making it out to be.

BeardPower

[13:41](#msg5a50d2106117191e6131cfd3)@CryptoGaston\_twitter @PeterWAWood  
First, I'm not a lawyer. I just want to tell you, what I know out of experience and working in this field.  
When I said, @dockimbel has to be asked for this, I did not state, that he has the authority or knowledge himself about this topic (as he is not a lawyer), but it's possible, that he can provide an answer (through knowing or working together with lawyers/people, who have this knowledge).  
I'm sorry, if there was some misunderstanding on this!

&gt;It’s usually either allowed or not allowed, by whoever is holding the token sale.

There are two groups of ICOs: ICOs, which do not care about to be compliant with the laws and ICOs, which do!  
Regarding the US, the regulations are based on residency, not citizenship. If you are an accredited investor, there is no issue with participating in an ICO. There needs to be a legal council involved on a case to case basis, getting an exception, that US residents are not classified as accredited investors.  
Another issue is allowing fiat currency for the ICO. The company behind the ICO would need a money service license for that. Every country has different regulations. The reason, why the former group of ICOs accept everyone and offers to contribute in fiat currency is, because they are fully compliant with the law, don't know better or they just don't care!

So, the foundation behind the RCT ICO being one of the latter ICOs, can play it safe by not allowing all these kind of things in the first place.

@PeterWAWood  
&gt;The organisation making the ICO has no idea of the nationality of the purchaser so any statement as to whether a citizen of county X, Y or Z can purchase is only advice.

As this is being a part of KYC (knowing your customer) and AML (Anti Money Laundering), it has to.

&gt;The organization DOES have “an idea of the nationality.” Some ICOs use geolocation to block US Citizens.

You are correct on this, but regulation is way more strict on that: KYC and AML!

If an ICO is not complying with all this, they company behind it can get in a lot of trouble afterwards.

&gt;ICOs are not “forbidden” in the US, but if the token is considered a security, additional steps need to be taken by the issuer before US citizens can buy. This is way more nuanced than you’re making it out to be.

Absolutely, but these additional steps are very complicated and time consuming, need a lot of time and money. By not allowing US residents and fiat money as contribution form, you can minimize risk and be compliant.

[13:48](#msg5a50d3a66117191e6131d62a)Thanks! I’m not advocating for any particular outcome re: allowing US residents. :) I interpreted Peter’s earlier response as, “Well, it’s up to US residents to decide if they can participate or not,” which didn’t really make sense to me. Maybe I misunderstood. Anyway, thank you for the information!

BeardPower

[11:10](#msg5a5351b3290a1f4561618d63)@dsgeyser Most people think of BTC, mining coins and the blockchain, but this is not really the idea behind it. The idea was to have a transparent, secure and decentralized ledger. A blockchain is just one of many data structures, how such a ledger can be implemented. As @dockimbel pointed out, there are many different implementations with a different feature set. Some don't charge fees, are faster and more flexible or don't even have the possibility of coins to be mined.

@9214 As @rebolek already explained, most people are in for the fast money. They want to get into pre-token sales to buy a new token for 0.01 cents and speculate on a rising price to sell quick, There are a lot of examples, where an ICO ended in a profit factor of 1600 (no, this is not a typo) after half of a year.  
There are speculation tokens and utility tokens. The former are just listed on an exchange for trading, you cannot use them for a service or to buy anything with them. The latter have actual real value, as you can use them to buy a service, vote with them or trade them. The RCT token is a utility token, which mints the "RED" coin.

&gt;how is your list of learning resources coming on? It's not that I'm pushing you, just deducing whenever I'll have a chance to understand blockchain/crypto niche in the upcoming week or two.

No worries. I hopefully have the wiki entry finished this week. :)

@KimRoach143\_twitter It depends on your usage and the balance between security and usability. Hardware wallets support other nice services as 2FA, PGP or SSH. You can also create a free paper wallet or generate your keys offline. As long as you keep your private keys safe, you are good.  
This questions will also be covered by my wiki entry.  
Just keep in mind, that your wallet does not keep your Ether, these are stored on the ledger, but just your keys!

[11:43](#msg5a53595b03838b2f2a84b26b)@AmurLisp\_twitter I see your question on Telegram. Well, Red/C3 branch is aimed specifically at smart contracts niche, as of now team working hard to present working prototype later in Q1 of this year. Read \[recent announcement](http://www.red-lang.org/2017/12/leaping-into-future-red-goes-blockchain.html) and \[QA session](http://www.red-lang.org/2018/01/answers-to-community-questions.html) for more details.

Red is successor of Rebol language, which itself could be described as "Lisp, Forth and Logo hybrid on steroids". (first version of Rebol compiler was in fact written in Scheme ;)) Lisp and Red share powerful metaprogramming capabilities, homoiconity and ease-of-use for DSL creation (as you may guess, Red/C3 will be a DSL for programming smart contracts).

What Red takes from Forth is insanely small size and language-oriented approach to solving problems (i.e. instead of programming directly in Red you might end up creating your own mini-language which is closer to the problem domain, that is, DSL).

Idk about Lisps, but Red is feature-packed from the ground up and comes with a lot of batteries included - we have built-in TDPL parser, (almost) cross platform GUI system, DSL for graphics drawing and for UI description, low-level DSL for system programming (Red/System), 50+ datatypes, experimental macro system... all of that and more is packed into single \*\*1MB\** executable.

If you are an accredited investor you could. You would need to answer a questionary from the ICO company, to prove that to them. Additionally they would need to get a statement from a legal team, which states, that the ICO is not a security. With this letter, they can ask for an exemption letter from the SEC.  
As this is very costly, they decided to play it save and don't accept US residents.

It's not about citizenship, but residency!

[17:46](#msg5a565179ba39a53f1afd015d)@greggirwin RED does not need to be a registered security. If the ICO would get an exemption letter from the SEC, the ICO would not be treated as a security and so there would not be an issue with accepting US residents.

[19:56](#msg5a57c153b48e8c3566cbd558)On privacy, this is a very new world, and we will be inventing it to some extent. In some cases, the goal is to acknowledge others publicly. But sometimes also privately. And "others" may not mean a specific person. It may mean an organization, a module, an article, a performance, an invocation of a function, etc. Ideally, we'll be able to choose what we want to be searchable and analyzable, and maybe we can even monetize our own information, but keeping some things private.

I haven't had time to think deeply through it all. Nobody has. But @BeardPower or other experts might have more informed views about how this will work, how some chains may be private, and inter-cha(i)nge can be made to provide anonymity, but not be easily exploited for misuse.

[19:59](#msg5a57c21183152df26d5d225a)A (nearly) complete list of dialects, where blocks of data are interpreted in a specific way by the compiler/interpreter is the following:  
\- the preprocessor dialect,  
\- the parse dialect,  
\- the visual interface dialect (VID),  
\- which also uses the draw dialect  
\- and the shape dialect,  
\- the various spec dialects involved in defining vectors, images, bitsets, objects, errors, maps, functions and routines,

9214

[20:00](#msg5a57c25fb48e8c3566cbd96b)@meijeru wow, thanks for clarifications, I didn't even thought about some of them. The questions is - what's the definition of a \*dialect\*? Any `load`able data that is treated differently from normal (`do`) evaluation rules?

[20:01](#msg5a57c2876117191e615494dd)why `compose` is a dialect though?

greggirwin

[20:01](#msg5a57c29a290a1f4561796d48)@9214, I'm not speaking from a position of authority or inside information here, but have some thoughts on your questions.

&gt; Do you expect any kind of opposition from Solidity / Electron / webapps experts (since they occupied the niche you're aiming to take over)?

Sure, until they see the light. They'll call us crazy, liars, black magic, "can't work", etc.

&gt; Will /C3 give user an option to create so-called "template contract" or "non-programming" contract or it doesn't make much sense, since it's just a trade-off?

C3 will be a high level contract language, but there may be a lower level language as well, and surely then you can create templates that use C3..

&gt; How /C3 source code (or any other Red or Red's dialect code) could be audited and proved? Isn't language too meta and dynamic for that (though I understand that /C3 won't be turing complete and it will ease the process)?

All of Red can't be formally analyzed, true. But it can't be compiled either. Still, we have a Red compiler today that can compile a \*lot* of Red code, even if not all. Part of the design process is just that, how safe and provable can we make a language while still providing the capabilities needed to make it useful. C3v1 will help us learn that, and we can build over it, so you can choose power versus safety as your needs demand.

[20:02](#msg5a57c2c3ce68c3bc74a819b7)@dander, bingo! It's the func \*spec* dialect.

[20:04](#msg5a57c33c6117191e61549835)@9214 I think your definition is fine, and one could even go so far as to state that "normal" Red is the "do dialect". Compose is a dialect because parens are treated differently from other values inside the block.

9214

[20:05](#msg5a57c37983152df26d5d2bec)so, dialect is any valid value that has special treatment?

The goal of tokens is multi-faceted and means a lot of R&amp;D, but consider how we pay for tools today, e.g. Visual Studio, and how that might be different. If you want more commercial power tools, those may use tokens. If you want to use a Red-based SaaS, it could run on tokens. If you want to tip or be tipped with tokens, you'll need an account. It doesn't mean you would necessarily be locked out of a community chat program, but tokens might open special features, like github making you pay to have private repos. And you don't have to pay money to get tokens. You can be tipped for helping others in chat, for writing articles or documentation, or submitting PRs to the code base. And those are just a few basic ideas we know of today.

BeardPower

[22:18](#msg5a5934371dcb91f17743adf1)@dander The RED token is an ERC20 token. ERC20 is a specification of tokens on the Etherium Blockchain. The ICO is using smart contracts, which is code running on the Blockchain. E.g. distributing the RED coin, once the ICO is over. The RED foundation will use more smart contracts in the future, based on the coins/tokens. Such smart contracts are a feature of the Etherium Blockchain. Other distributed ledgers don't support smart contracts, so they chose to use Etherium. It's widely adopted.

dander

[22:33](#msg5a5937d2ce68c3bc74af37f8)@BeardPower Thanks, so suppose you want so send someone 1 RED as a tip, would there be an Ethereum processing charge associated with that? Or how is that gotten around? Are the ERC20 tokens running on some side system?

BeardPower

[22:39](#msg5a59391583152df26d6492ee)@dander  
&gt;The ERC20 token standard describes the functions and events that an Ethereum token contract has to implement.

There other specs as well, but they are all running on Etherium.

&gt;would there be an Ethereum processing charge associated with that?

Yes. The token has specific digits. Once the coin is released, you can add a custom token on MEW, where you have to specify the params of the token, including it's digits. These are used to calculate it's value compared to Ether. When you send a tip, you are sending the coin of this token, which has a value (as it is traded on an exchange). This value will be compared to it's Ether value and the transaction fees are calculated in Ether.

&gt;Are the ERC20 tokens running on some side system?

No. ERC20 is only specific to Etherium.

[22:41](#msg5a5939915a9ebe4f757df1a1)A token is just the vehicle to carry specific assets:  
&gt;A “token” by definition is a representation any fungible tradible good such as currency, loyalty points, gold certificates, in game items and more.

[22:41](#msg5a5939a7ba39a53f1a0be61e)So the RED coins is an asset, the RED token carries.

[22:42](#msg5a5939d161a861c927080eb3)It could also carry voting rights, voting power, code, anything you specify through the smart contract.

[22:43](#msg5a593a0ece68c3bc74af42c9)Other distributed ledgers also have tokens and smart contracts, but not ERC20 tokens.

[22:44](#msg5a593a6bba39a53f1a0be98a)If you are interested in how you can add ERC-20 tokens on MEW watch this video: \[Adding custom ERC-20 tokens in MEW](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/tokens/adding-custom-ethereum-tokens.html)

[22:47](#msg5a593b1b5a9ebe4f757df803)Software wallets like Exodus or hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano S, can handle ERC-20 tokens. To see the asset it carries, you need to implement an app. This app will manage the asset, so it will be manageable in the wallet software.

dander

[22:52](#msg5a593c25ae53c15903df5266)Okay, thanks for the link! The reason I ask is that I've gotten the impression that transaction fees have gone up a lot for the bigger blockchains, related to their own value, and the amount of congestion on the network. So for small things like tipping, I don't understand how that will scale. Especially as more and more applications/contracts are being added onto the network.

BeardPower

[22:53](#msg5a593c65ba39a53f1a0bf1db)To send a custom token, you need Ether on your wallet, as the fee is in Ether, regardless of the token you will send.

The issue with a decentralized exchange is, that you need a high performance d-Ledger/transactions. Every tech at the moment is to slow, but this will change soon.

&gt;Wouldn't it put the other exchanges out of business?

Depends on the big players. Banks, regulations and so on.

&gt; What benefit will they still provide?

\- Atomic swaps (free transactions on a private d-Ledger)  
\- Instant transfers  
\- Free

rickstefanowski\_twitter

[20:03](#msg5a5bb7885ade18be39760f81)Hello everyone, I am trying to understand the economics that affect the price of the Red Token. Since there is no staking/mining, how does the price of the token go up? And how does the change in price affect the usefulness of the dapps powered by it?

greggirwin

[20:19](#msg5a5bbb3d6117191e616578c0)Welcome Rick! It's a brave new world and, for the time being, you should take anything said here as "possibilities". Most of us are Red developers, not blockchain or crypto experts. @BeardPower is our resident guru in that area, but none of us can speak officially for Team Red at this time.

That said, if we consider that RED is a utility token, and we deal in tokenomics, price is something of an external concept. We don't know yet exactly how this will all play out in different areas and Dapps, but the whitepaper and ICO page list some initial thoughts.

For the simple case of tipping someone, or some \*thing\*, it's up to the user. If a token-cost is set for a service, Dapp, or resource, that may change dynamically. The value of tokens will depend on a particular exchange and demand, yes? So if you need tokens to run a Dapp, but only have ETH, the "value" of the token to the holder is how many ETH you trade, and what value those ETH, in turn, have in some legal tender. And if I provide a service or sell a tool, I will need to adjust my token prices over time to stay competitive.

[20:27](#msg5a5bbd176117191e6165820b)Longer term, in the field in general, I can imagine huge potential for predictive analytics, reputation systems, and more being applied to dynamic valuation of tokens in their respective economies.

BeardPower

[20:42](#msg5a5bc0c7290a1f45618a60f1)@rickstefanowski\_twitter Hi Rick. RED is a utility token, which means, that you can buy services with RED, unlike with speculative tokens. The more coverage and adoption of the RED token will be, the more valuable it will become. The RED token will also be tradable on an exchange, so it's basic market economics of offer and demand. The RED foundation is keeping some tokens, so price can be stabilized through buy back programs, vetting and tipping.

[20:51](#msg5a5bc2cf1dcb91f1774d8f62)Regarding change in price and dApps: The RED token is an ERC-20 token (it's based on Ethereum). When the RED token will rise in price, the rate to other currencies will also change. You might get more Ether for it and the transactions will get cheaper, as it's value is higher than before. dApps would be worth more, as they are represented in RED tokens and you have to pay with RED tokens for them. Changing the RED token back to fiat currency, you will make more money, as the higher the RED token is valued over time, the more valuable the dApps will become.

rickstefanowski\_twitter

[21:42](#msg5a5bceb0290a1f45618aa4d4)I would say a lot of speculative tokens are utility tokens that are not yet serving their purpose. The goal is for the speculation to transition to where tokens sometimes serve as equity and as a dapp specific fuel. In ethereum many dapps either collect the fuel and redistribute it to token holders. Others burn the token as it is used for fuel. I assume the same options will exist here? This will lead to a fluctuation in the price of Red so fees will have to priced is something stable and converted at time of use for fuel. This will require a smart contract tied to a dex with liquidity, all done in the background. Otherwise the barrier for use will be too high. Am I thinking correctly about this?

[21:42](#msg5a5bcee41dcb91f1774dc548)Also, what type of dapp development interest is there in this community? What teams exist, and what types of dapps are they looking to build?

rebolek

[21:51](#msg5a5bd0cc1dcb91f1774dce57)As I understand it, the goal for Red team is not to build dapps, but build tools for building dapps.

greggirwin

[22:23](#msg5a5bd851517037a212a7534c)@rickstefanowski\_twitter, as I understand it, the same options will exist for RED, but the general Red community only learned of C3 and the ICO project when everyone else did, so there hasn't been public discussion of detailed fee models. Gitter chat on Red is focused on the Red langauge. This room was added when the ICO was made public, but we are not a speculation based community. Many of us are new to blockchains in general. At this time, there are no public Dapp dev teams or public Dapp projects in the works.

The way I see it, the main barrier, for RED, will be ease of use; can we make it easy to pass tokens around, and start giving them meaning in the context of what we do.

BeardPower

[00:09](#msg5a5bf13bae53c15903e9c488)@rickstefanowski\_twitter Let me rephrase it. There are equity tokens and utility tokens. The former represent a stake in a company, stocks, voting rights, debts... You cannot buy a service from the company, which issued them. Utility tokens are not designed for speculation. There serve as a coupon or represent value to buy services with it. As explained by @rebolek, Red/C3 is a tool to create smart contracts in the Red language. It's a tool to create dApps. You can use the Red token/coin to buy a service (paying a coder to implement a feature in Red you want to see), or use the tokens a a tip or voting right. There would be the possibility to create other tokens on a different ledger, which offers transactions without a fee.

[00:16](#msg5a5bf2c0ce68c3bc74b98c72)It depends on the contract, if tokens will be burned. New tokens could also be minted.

[12:03](#msg5a5f3b88290a1f45619c3b40)Moreover, the current change in China wrt to OTC trading will most probably affect our plans. We'll see in the next days/weeks if a regulation comes or not.

BeardPower

[12:22](#msg5a5f4004ae53c15903fb0c0d)@dockimbel Absolutely. There is a lot going on lately. Regulation has to come and will come. This was unavoidable. It's not about banning Cryptos in general, but banning unregulated exchanges. The majority of exchanges will get bitten for not being compliant with the regulations and the law. KYC, AML, MBL and so on. Therefore it's crucial, that the RED coin/token is listed on a regulated, compliant exchange.

[12:30](#msg5a5f41d7ba39a53f1a2747ea)I don't want to advertise an exchange here, but there is one coming up this year (it's currently in it's ICO state), which will be fully regulated and compliant. It will also offer ETCF (exchange traded crypto funds; just like an ETF), so it would be possible to get the RED token into an IT basket, which would be very beneficial.

dockimbel

[13:35](#msg5a5f51225a9ebe4f759a5583)@BeardPower You think you can land that much at once on a bank account without any trouble? Many banks would just freeze the account once they know that the money comes from selling crypto-assets. Then for the few banks that are whitelisting a few exchanges for such operations, you still have to provide the full KYC for justifying the sources. Can easily take weeks, if not months for them to process it. And I'm not even talking about the countries where once converted in fiat, you'll have to give up half of it in taxes. ;-) So definitely not a simple thing to do.

BeardPower

[13:42](#msg5a5f52baae53c15903fb840b)@dockimbel The exchange based in Austria has a daily limit of 500k, a monthly limit of 5 Million Eur and an overall limit of 100 Million Eur, through SEPA and if you do a video ident KYC. The KYC takes about 5-15 min. You will have to pay some fees, as it's not a trading exchange but just fiat&lt;-&gt;cryto. Well, I just know that the EU court decided, that the exchange from fiat&lt;-&gt;currency is a tax free act, but yes, it's not some simple thing to do. Everyone and his mum want to cash in on it.

[13:57](#msg5a5f564aae53c15903fb9941)@dockimbel I don't see a problem with the bank, if they are compliant with KYC, but of course you would need a bank prepared for such amounts. The funds would not be personal income. but the income of the foundation/company, right? It depends on the country your company is incorporated. There are some countries, which don't have taxes, if you will reinvest into the company, which you will do.  
It's not easy and it's time consuming, but doable.

dockimbel

[14:00](#msg5a5f570b5ade18be3988ce67)@BeardPower Yes, possible, just long and complex, as one has to go through many hurdles.

BeardPower

[14:05](#msg5a5f58215ade18be3988d516)@dockimbel On this, I totally agree on. I really hope you get over every hurdle without any bruises. And, as already pointed out, there is always the option to pay/sponsor in Ether.

Could anyone please tell me about this? I am doing a research work on public permissioned blockchains and came across BIGCHAIN DB. I would like to know what is the criteria or who selects or in what basis the nodes are participated? As far as i know, public means anyone can participate like bitcoin, but permissioned public sounds confusing to me, so permissioned public means there has to be certain condition or rule which the node has to be met to participate, so my questions is who sets this criteria and in what basis this is done? Could anyone elaborate to me this please?  
Thanks you,  
Gulshan

greggirwin

[13:40](#msg5a65e9e1ce68c3bc74eb98ad)@gulshankrish\_twitter, @BeardPower is our resident blockchain expert, but BigChainDb looks to still be in its early days, and their docs indicate that node criteria are based on rules set up by the consortium behind each cluster.

&gt; A consortium requires some form of governance to make decisions such as membership and policies. The exact details of the governance process are determined by each consortium

BeardPower

[14:38](#msg5a65f76498927d57451f86d9)@gulshankrish\_twitter It's not like permission for nodes, but for assets stored on the blockchain. A user can publish metadata and some condition, which defines who has access and how someone has access to the asset.

```
Bob owns the asset X. He publishes some metadata and conditions on how to get X. A simple case would to set the price of the asset.
Alice wants to access and read X. She reads the metadata and conditions about X, and she makes a payment (or whatever is needed) using the required fiat or crypto currency.
Alice transfers her access token (in this case, a payment receipt) for X to Bob.
Bob verifies that the access token is valid, and starts a handshake to create a shared session key with Alice.
Alice participates in the handshake.
Alice and Bob now have the same session key.
Bob encrypts X using the previously calculated session key and shares it with Alice, either on- or off-chain.

[14:44](#msg5a65f8b10ad3e04b1b536c3c)Permissioned public blockchain just means, that the blockchain supports permissions/ACLs like filesystems or databases do. When it comes to access for nodes/adding nodes, like @greggirwin already explained, it's decided by the owner of the ledger. A consortium, company etc. Ripple is not a community project, but a project of different banks, exchanges and brokers. It's the "anti-cryptocurrency".

[18:01](#msg5a6cbe7fce68c3bc740f98c2)@x8x Thanks for your help. I didn’t express me very well. Let me clarify it. To be more abstract, I want to know if it’s possible to develop distributed software on EVM. If it’s possible, I think there is no need to use a server to deplopy it.

BillDStrong

[18:03](#msg5a6cbf084a6b0dd32b555e34)That is what C3 is about. Keep in mind C3 is not complete, or even released yet. And the long term goal is for it to be agnostic, so it will work on multiple blockchain VMs.

[03:13](#msg5a7528d7e217167e2c36f303)Optimizing things will be interesting, because of overhead. We can do side chains, but we could also implement Dapps that accrue local (trans)actions into groups. e.g. every "export to PDF" or "generate random logo" action is logged, and when you hit N actions, it submits a transaction to the blockchain. Or you could just track them, show the user in their free app, and have a Donate button they can click to support you. Or maybe nagware gets more aggressive as the token debit adds up.

[03:22](#msg5a752ae6e217167e2c36f89a)@greggirwin Those would mostly be App specific. But looking at real world App Stores, time units are popular, as well as a full purchase. So providing an easy primitive for those options, then some point or unit system that the app can represent however they want, then provide some default values internally. This can also be used for analytics for usage info. And would allow for "Pay for only what you use." plans.

[03:23](#msg5a752b2898927d57456f894e)This also seems ripe for providing a way for users to be paid for their information, if we think hard enough about it.

BillDStrong

[21:26](#msg5a76291aac509d207db50d24)@BuilderGuy1 Presumably Red/C3 will be a great way to build such a system. Keep in mind this would really only be a view over data contained in the block-chain, so it could present a simple view for totals, a detailed view for taxes, and other views for analytics, or other applications. The chain is immutable, so fits naturally in a single data multi view scenario.

[21:28](#msg5a762992ac509d207db51054)So multiple apps can view it from pretty much anywhere. And choosing a tax provider can become as easy as authoring the decryption of your data, if that were implemented.

greggirwin

[00:27](#msg5a76538fb3c4a0d376d942e3)@BuilderGuy1, the goal is to make the blockchain disappear behind the scenes, because otherwise it will be overwhelming to users, and they will make expensive mistakes. So you just use apps, not concerned with any of it. You have a wallet loaded with tokens, and sometimes you need to top it up if an app tells you there aren't enough to run. Some may be "Free", though, in trade for using your information to resell, or to show ads, like FB and Google do today. One difference being that we can provide an easy option to pay a little in order to avoid ads or get more privacy. The apps is the same either way. It just looks at a smart contract that checks whether you're a paid user, or want ads or to sell your soul for free service.

At the end of the month, you could view an invoice, which may be another Dapp, which looks at the blockchain and shows you a summary of all your charges, for each app used. Each total could be a link that drills down into the details for that service. Not sure why X cost so much? Drill down.

greggirwin

[19:33](#msg5a775ffb6117191e61f3967c)@BeardPower +1. @OneArb, few people here know blockchains in depth, but we're all going to learn a lot, very fast, going forward. Red has plans and a direction regarding blockchain technology, specifically Red/C3 and the RED token that was created for use with blockchains and Dapps. Beyond that, we are trying to imagine how it will all work, and what we'll build.

Building a cross chain compiler will be a challenge, but is pretty much straight tech. Take a language and compile it to different blockchain VMs. Red already does this with OSs, so we can be confident in how that will work. \*However\*, what happens next is like asking what kind of apps people will build with Red. Or asking what the internet might be used for back in 1993.

Controling hash power is only part of the equation.

It would all depend on the intent of the attack, double-spend or chain take over.

For the later, the validating nodes run by exchanges, major payment processors, other miners, collect new transactions in the mempool. They run a full node since they are the main transaction source / processor.

Once a blockchain was forked in order to reverse transactions some view it can no longer be considered as an immutable store of value.  
This is a reference to Ethereum Classic vs. Ethereum. Ethereum rolled back the blockchain to the state prior to the DAO hack vs. Ethereum Classic deciding to preserve the immutable nature of the blockchain at the cost of the hacker keeping what he was able to extract fom DAO investors.&gt;

@BeardPower, I get a little queasy inside when I think about being part of the Ad system, but I feel the same about speculative ICOs. What I see now, and why I'm fully behind the blockchain effort for Red, is that we are focused on the underlying technology. I think BAT and other systems are a layer above where we are now. By facilitating the transparent use of tokens and other blockchain-based assets, we will enable things like BAT, and a lot more.

BeardPower

[20:09](#msg5a9ef58a8f1c77ef3a8e063d)BAT is just cutting out the middleman (the big boys), needed to manage your Ad payments, by using direct transfers to your wallet. This is a good thing. The idea decribed in the article (having a transparent wallet managment) is very nice indeed. There is still a wallet, which contradicts the headline: \[...] doesn't have wallets \[..]. That's what I don't like about the article.

[20:18](#msg5a9ef7a535dd17022e2bc228)My gut feeling is that BAT isn't cutting out the middleman, it's making Brave the new middleman, just at a lower cost to ad publishers, and potentially rewarding ad consumers.

BeardPower

[19:43](#msg5aa040cfc3c5f8b90d45c929)@greggirwin Both of our lists get longer with the hour ;-) The issue with transferring funds quick and cheap is the used ledger technology. Most exchanges are using BTC as their base currency or fiat money in some sort. BTC or ETH transactions are slow and not cheap. Especially BTC! Using MIOTA as a base currency would be cost free and fast.  
Most exchanges are centralized, so they must keep your assets in their more or less secure wallets and are affected by hacks, bugs and scaling issues. Decentralized exchanges are the new king of the hill in the future. They offer atomic swaps and your funds are always kept in your wallet, there is no intermediate, pure P2P. The disadvantage is lower volume and higher fees depending on an involved relay party.  
Using a DEX would fulfill most of your "wish", as you are always moving things to a safe harbor. The rest would need a wallet software/service, which is splitting your keys into a multi-sig wallet.

Great! Ledger just released a new Firmware with security updates and more space for apps.

If so, then the effective volume on those decentralized relays should be way higher than what I can see for now.

Yes, that is correct.

You can settle transactions directly without any middleman, but it's a little hard to find a counterparty. This is where relayer come in. They share their order book with the DEX and act as a liquidity pool. Many relayer can plug into the DEX, each with their own order book. Additionally, relayer can plug into other relayer and share their order book for a even fuller liquidity pool.  
So yes, if there are big relayer working together, it would have way higher volume than a CEX. Orders are matched off-chain and settled on-chain.

This site has a very nice explanation video and information about it: \[Relayer network](https://relayer.network/)

&gt;So I buy eth with Fiat money Use one account with kyc send it to someone else that person exchange it with fiat money somewhere other part of the world does that person need kyc approved account if so. Still bank will know not so private they can track or maybe be I am not getting it right

Yes. The sender needs to do KYC with the exchange and the bank, the receiver has to do KYC with the bank (because he does not buy cryptos for fiat, but sell it).

No, the bank will not know the private key, but the bank can look up the transaction and because of the KYC can link the transaction to the fiat money account.

[12:48](#msg5ab79aa627c509a774a00122)@9214 Yeah, FFT and iFFT are a hard nut to crack because of the math behind it (depends if you like calculus or not) but the concept is really simple.

[12:53](#msg5ab79bc3c3c5f8b90dafec08)@viayuve The private keys is just needed to access the assets, but the public key can be known to everyone. The wallet is derived from the public key.  
Wallet: like your bank account. KYC is needed/done to link your personal details to the Wallet. No one except the exchange and the bank would know that info.  
Private key: like the right to cash-out on the bank account

[13:16](#msg5ab7a14a5f188ccc15f4b615)@BeardPower are there any other, smarter and more effective versions of "Proof of Work" algorithms?

BeardPower

[13:22](#msg5ab7a2955f188ccc15f4bad9)@9214 Yes. E.g. LTC (Litecoin) is using a different hashing algorithm, which does not use that much resources. PoW is always about the hashing puzzle, so you can only tweak the algorithm used.

[13:22](#msg5ab7a2ae27c509a774a01cfd)That's why they call it "Lite"coin :)

[13:23](#msg5ab7a2ef458cbde55773afa3)PoW is abandoned in any newer DLT, as it's wasting too much resources just for solving the hashing puzzle. Newer ones are PoS (proof of stake) and PoM (proof of machine).

BeardPower

[19:06](#msg5ab944bd35dd17022ea1b965)@9214 Well, I'm trying to explain it:  
Imagine you have a car. It has 60 liters of gasoline in the tank and it's using 1liter/km, so you can drive 60km. You want to drive 60km. You pay 1 EUR for 1 liter of gasoline so you have to spend 60 EUR.

Now, the fuel is the gasoline called Ether. You have 10000 gwei in your wallet, it's using 21gwei per calculation, so you can have about 48 of calculation rounds, gas price is the price for the fuel. You pay 21 gwei for 1 round of fuel so you have to spend 10000 gwei.

When you drive along, your car is using gasoline and when you reach 60km you are out of gas.

When a miner is processing your transaction, he is using fuel/Ether and when he spent 10000 gwei he is out of gas.

[21:25](#msg5ad9095c6d7e07082b11df6b)Sometimes dangerous to say things lightly, because Red makes them possible. :^)

In talking about modern UIs, and how to create nice ones, most systems use enormous raster image assets, because...I guess they don't care about size. We can do that too, but how said will it be to have a 1MB app with 30MB of graphics that just make it shiny. Well, maybe not sad, as it add to the user experience, but we should be able to do better, don't you think?

@rgchris did beautiful, small work in R2, and a combination of small raster images, `draw`, and effects pipeline should allow us to build nice looking GUIs without bloat.

[21:26](#msg5ad90980109bb04332de00b8)That said, just using raster images for skinning can be very simple, and is a viable choice. Just with different priorities.

BeardPower

[21:31](#msg5ad90abb2b9dfdbc3aab26fb)@greggirwin  
&gt;I guess they don't care about size.

Well it's a combination of PS skills and lacking Illustrator skills. It's harder to pull of effects with vector graphics than it is with raster graphics.  
Most UI kits are not vector based, Adobe killed SVG and yes, no one cares about size (yes, I'm mlooking to you, Electron!).

UI for Apps don't need raster graphics, games are different in that regard.

greggirwin

[21:38](#msg5ad90c736d7e07082b11ee5d)But we should be able to apply the effect pipeline after rasterizing, so we will get overhead, based on face size, no way around that, but not AOT.

dander

[17:37](#msg5b06f847aaafa25932b2bc7b)I just mean that most people don't have the capability to exhaustively vet the code that they run, even if it is of high importance, like a crypto wallet. Saying "you should understand/compile the thing from sources" sort of implies that the people who are qualified to use crypto currency is a very small pool of highly technical users. Eventually you need some sort of system of trust for broader use. If you want to really go down the rabbit hole, you are also trusting the OS code you're running, because it could arbitrarily alter things in your applications... But I guess everyone assumes OS vendors aren't going to do that because people would eventually find out, and they would go out of business. I don't really want to start a debate about it. Just pointing out that security is hard, and it's an easy trap to just put the onus on users

rebolek

[17:45](#msg5b06fa2ad88b24150d3162ef)&gt; you are also trusting the OS code you're running, because it could arbitrarily alter things in your applications

Right. It's the same with the wallet app. Actually I don't think you need to compile it yourself if it's served from HTTPS with hashes available to check integrity \*and* if you trust the source of the app (like Red wallet from Red team is certainly more trust-able than myamazingredwallet.com for example).  
Another thing is that there are no officials exes available AFAIK, so you have to compile it yourself, but that's because Red wallet is still in alpha IMO.

dander

[17:46](#msg5b06fa823815f70bffd67f3d)Right, I agree the current way is appropriate

[21:41](#msg5b0731822942532e42dcf192)@dander, you're right on all counts, and we have had a \*lot* of chat about this. How best to secure things, and make it easy for users to know and trust that they have a valid build, when it will be a huge target for hackers. Basically, you can never trust the client app to validate itself. Users can't vet them either, as you noted. So we need \*something* we can trust. We'll do a couple easy things to start, and see if we can build tools to help others facing the same problem. From there, we either have to become a reputable and trusted source, or a group of like-minded people and projects need to create that trusted source.

[21:42](#msg5b0731dafb0f4a0bfe6a930e)The easy thing is really easy, and @x8x already has that in place. Basically, you just drop the exe on a page we provide, and the hash is vetted against a list of known, trusted builds.

[21:11](#msg5b71f3fb67eb9f60fed749da)Maybe it's a good point to contact the people doing research on these topics? There are plenty of DLTs backed by researches/universities and non-profit institutions trying to solve exactly those issues.

[07:11](#msg5bbc548e1c100a4f2953fdb7)@9214 No mention of maximum values. It just says that "balance is a scalar value".

9214

[07:14](#msg5bbc5543bbdc0b25050c95d9)@PeterWAWood all scalars are unsigned 256 bit integers, so, yeah, this should be the upper bound.

PeterWAWood

[07:20](#msg5bbc56adbbdc0b25050c9f3a)@9214 Yes it seems that way. So the biggest ether balance on the current EVM would be `(10 ** 256) / 1e18)`.

[07:36](#msg5bbc5a89ef4afc4f28410e70)Forgot to take away one, it should be `(10 ** 256 - 1) / 1e18`.
