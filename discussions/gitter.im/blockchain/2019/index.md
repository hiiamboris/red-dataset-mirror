[20:28](#msg5c40e5721cb70a372af55486)Hi! I've tried to compile `red/wallet` under linux. It compiles fine, but gives me \*access violation* error, when I run it. It's probably not the same problem as previous \[Gtk issue](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/\[NOTES]-Gtk-Bindings-Development#known-problems), because it crashes even on 32-bit system, on which simple \*Vid* tests run ok. I even disabled all HID and hardware wallets, put a dummy software wallet instead (see \[my GitHub](https://github.com/robotix-pl/wallet/tree/softwallet) ), thinking that lack of USB dongle might be the cause. What do you think?

That depends. You won't be able to make a quick buck on our project and technology, simply because we don't play this game and push against crypto speculators.

This is an interesting way of doing a project. It looks like the retro blockchain. However, there still needs some methods to maintain the token price to some extent to help contributors to get something real? Or tokens are only prize medals like early bitcoin.

[01:02](#msg5d1415a96fb02f5f693b345d)@siriusye Let me rephrase it. It's illega to take such ridiculous high feest to list an asset. Just look into the listing fees of stock exchanges and others. The fees are regulated! Example: Binance and other exchanges asked for millions to list an asset. A stock exchange's listing fee is about 300 EUR. They just charge for the paperwork and work need to get the asset listed.

Did your friend sell the tokens? If not she did not have a loss as she still has the tokens. There will only be a win or loss if that trade/exchange is settled.

siriusye

[02:25](#msg5d142909b3f22a4b2a4382a6)So the problem is money. However, this shouldn't be a big problem. The ICO raised 28137 ETH. Given there were sales expense etc., I don't know how much you've got on hand. I assume 60% of eth can go to the project. Back to the that time, eth was worth about $900. So 60% percent of 28137 worth about $15 million. I know Binance or Bitfinex normally asks a prices between 1 million and 5 million. After spend money on one of the top exchanges, the team should still have sufficient money for several years of developing.

[02:28](#msg5d1429be6fb02f5f693bded9)If the token price is boosted, the team also can benefit from it. The foundation and team still holds 100 million red tokens. If the price is $1, then there is $100 million. A few million for 100 million is a good deal.

[02:34](#msg5d142b516e07c204706c09db)I guess the real case is the team didn‘t cash out at a good price, but cashed out when eth price was heavily dumped. So team only have several millions on hand. This money is needed for maintaining the developing team for a few years. So there is no money for exchanges. Even the red language and c3 dsl is finished, there still will be no resource for the token price.

[02:48](#msg5d142e6f850b87037c6885f7)Everyone should live with their decision. Ironically, the lady I mentioned before lost huge amount of money in this project now works as a partner of a crypto exchange.

BeardPower

[10:49](#msg5d149f1eb3f22a4b2a47a8d6)@siriusye  
Spending money on those horrific and illegal fees is like burning it. Money needs to be taken to good use, which is development. Neither Binance nor Bitfinex is top exchanges. &gt;85% of the exchanges' volume is fake volume. They are neither regulated, performant, or feature-rich. It also makes no sense in splitting liquidity if an already illiquid asset.  
The token price will be boosted if the utility token is used in services and products. The current price is only formed by hype, FOMO, greed, and criminal activities by certain market participants.

Again, listed on a regulated exchanged is free! Resources for the token price? It's a utility token and price is formed by its usage.

She would only have lost money if she sold the token. No money would have been lost until a trade is settled. The golden rule of investing: only invest money you can afford to lose.

"Blockchain" is such a generic (and misused) term that it's impossible to figure what "relationships" you're talking about. Clearly, project's goals, related to blockchain, are described in the whitepaper.

&gt; So the ICO you made last year should not be based on ETH.

So, usage of crypto-assets is prohibited unless it's somehow "related to blockchain"? I have trouble following this leap of logic.

&gt; C3 has seriously deviated from its development plan so far.

Which is more than expected with experimental software and murky, constantly shifting landscape, such as Ethereum ecosystem.

[04:57](#msg5d1c35af6658420b1ce4e400)We use PRTG monitoring at work, and I have found their article about the upcoming Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency. They don't seem to be all-positive about it. On an interesting side, they are introducing a statically typed language, called Move. The code looks kind of readable, but far from the DSL cleanness. Would it be worth to support Libry by C3? Or better - is that even technically possible, if it does not follow some cryptocurrency principles?

https://blog.paessler.com/the-unbearable-lightness-of-bitcoin

greggirwin

[18:01](#msg5d1ced5e07bf5635af202558)First, let me opine (state an opinion). The whitepaper says:

&gt; The Libra mission is to enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers  
billions of people

I believe that is disingenuous. Maybe the development team believes that, but if that was FB's mission for Libra, while FB's own mission, by law, is profit, they would have gone about it a different way. They want to empower people the same way FB wants to connect people.

That said, they want to ride the blockchain wave as well, and we've learned a lot from our time there. Like, having cryptographers design computing systems doesn't make for foolproof systems. It can make for an incredibly secure infrastructure that people can't use safely. Like having a bank vault door on your house, but you can easily lock yourself out, or accidentally leave it unlocked and not know it.

Let's look at a couple `move` samples:

```
public deposit(payee: address, to_deposit: Coin) {
let to_deposit_value: u64 = Unpack<Coin>(move(to_deposit));
let coin_ref: &mut Coin = BorrowGlobal<Coin>(move(payee));
let coin_value_ref: &mut u64 = &mut move(coin_ref).value;
let coin_value: u64 = *move(coin_value_ref);
*move(coin_value_ref) = move(coin_value) + move(to_deposit_value);
}

public withdraw_from_sender(amount: u64): Coin {
let transaction_sender_address: address = GetTxnSenderAddress();
let coin_ref: &mut Coin = BorrowGlobal<Coin>(move(transaction_sender_address));
let coin_value_ref: &mut u64 = &mut move(coin_ref).value;
let coin_value: u64 = *move(coin_value_ref);
RejectUnless(copy(coin_value) >= copy(amount));
*move(coin_value_ref) = move(coin_value) - copy(amount);
let new_coin: Coin = Pack<Coin>(move(amount));
return move(new_coin);
}
```

If you want to avoid mistakes, that doesn't look like a language to help you do it.

[18:10](#msg5d1cef942e3f431763690a6f)But the name "Move" sparked a thought. It's just that, with no analysis. If what you want is the ability to move assets from one place to another, shouldn't that all be built in? You may have conditions to check, but if you just had one `move` method, with a source, destination, and amount, it either works (atomically) or fails for some reason that it gives you (e.g. source account doesn't have enough funds).

In a world of separate systems, sure, you need `deposit` and `withdraw`, with some conversions possibly taking place as well. But within a single system, where there are X assets of a single type, that can only move from place to place, never being created or destroyed, you only need `move`. Build that into the system and avoid the gobbledygook above, that will be done wrong by many people.

\*Can* we support Libra? Yes. It's just a VM and bytecode. \*Should* we? Not just yet.
