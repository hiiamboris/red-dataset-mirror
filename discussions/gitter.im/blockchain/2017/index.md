You may say that I'm actually the one who slept in Arctica :zzz:

But, if Red team and our community can benefit from such move and gain a solid ground, I'm all in. I love X Internet idea, and ideas about community management and our own currency are really interesting. Still, most of this stuff sounds rather controversal for an uninitiated in blockchains and such. Guess I'll wait for the white paper?

That is understandable. As a start, please follow the links I have included about some keywords. We can gather in a wiki page all the best resources for learning more quickly about it. Though, some concepts I have learned only by exchanging with others, as the existing docs are not always clear, or too technical, not giving the big picture. Take all this as an opportunity to learn about the tech and concepts behind blockchains, just forget about pure cryptocurrencies and the speculation craziness.

[17:15](#msg5a413215ffa3e379197b9d31)@9214 my roadmap is that Red is superior to the script language underlying blockchain technology. I have a specific practical to make that happen.

[17:19](#msg5a413328a2a87ea0216dcc62)@dockimbel I hope my sincere worries are highly unfounded? I can "feel", there is some big picture and importantce to become part of the future bandwagon, but what I also worry is, that ppl were expecting 0.6.4, Android release, some IO release or even behind the scenes of compiler rewrite so almost 1.0. Do you e.g. remember, what happened during the REBOL/IOS era? The main toolchain did not see any release for 18 months. I know that you guys are doing the best to actually make Red grow, not the opposite, so I just hope the plan works :-)

also how would you compare it with the cost of a regular bank transaction?  
it consumes electricity even when you are not transacting, because the banks are paying for heating or cooling the bank buildings, keeping the ATMs online, etc etc

[17:33](#msg5a4136630163b0281079a075)@OneArb Sounds like it. I was applauding the decision for a small innovative tech company (Fullstack) to get into an emerging market rather than playing catch-up in more mature markets (e.g., cloud, mobile).

dockimbel

[17:35](#msg5a4136ea03838b2f2a36b673)@onetom I realize that maybe one useful first investment to do, would be to have some knowledgeable people put together some good docs about blockchains, smart contracts and Dapps.

[18:54](#msg5a414964a2a87ea0216e29f9)Here's what Ladislav (old Rebol guru community member) replied to me on Altme, re my remark, that Bitcoin's value is just - virtual:

"Pekr: "even if virtual" - bitcoins are no more "virtual" than any registered security in Czech Republic. In CZ, a registered security exists only as an entry in the "Central registry of securities". In the same manner, every bitcoin exists only as an entry (unspent output of a transaction) in the blockchain, i.e. the blockchain plays the same role for bitcoins as the database of the Central registry of securites does for securities in CZ. Nobody calls the registered securities "virtual", even though they exist only as records in the registry database. In the same manner, it does not make sense to call bitcoins "virtual". There is yet another way how to call something "virtual" - games simulating economic activities (like the Monopoly game) are called "virtual economies". Virtual economies have virtual products, virtual commodities and virtual money used to transact in the simulation. There is a significant difference between virtual products/money and real products/money, though. Virtual products/money are meant to be used in their corresponding virtual economy, while real products are meant to be used in the real world. Since bitcoins are designed to be used/usable in the real world, they are no more virtual than the registered securities in CZ."

[04:58](#msg5a432886c072deaf0b079e61)@maximvl Sorry, let me restate. ICO reserves part of RCT to reward existing contributors, marketing, code contributions, etc. Pretty standard ICO practice.

There is no cost to the foundation for the coins distributed to contributors. Investors know an RCT subset only is available to purchase, another subset is set aside for the purpose mentioned above and possibly another subset reserved for future use.

Many programmers are at work developing blockchain technology. Hence Bitcoin and Ethereum have served as a funding mechanism that has allowed seed capital on July 2017 to be on par with global mainstream seed investment.

It's at that point that the SEC decided to pull the plug, following suit from China to forbid ICOs.

Is circumventing legacy venture capital funding not a use case? Or should it demonstrate the potency of decentralizing and talied as a major win?

Ripple is a startup financed in part by the CME Group, the main US commodity exchange. It is however an open source project.

It's clear first aim is to overtake SWIFT international transfer business working around Central Banks who funnel the majority of international transfer. SWIFT is a cooperative corporation owned by banks.

Ripple controls, 55 Billion XRP, worth 100 Billion USD today. It remains to be seen how much independence this stash buys now that Ripple overtook Uber as the highest valued startup. Ripple overtook Ethereum to become the #2 market cap today. Will it hold?

&gt; @rebolek OK. And do you know why blockchain proof mechanism consumes so much energy ?

Almost all coins use POW - Proof of Work - strategies to secure the blockchain, that is do useless calculations such as finding the SHA-256 key for a random number called nonce. The first miner that cracks the key gets the reward ETH, BTC and many others and the right to issue the new block.

Ethereum researches into Proof of Stake aiming at putting an end to the waste. You'd be surprised to find out there are already other eco-friendly strategies such as Proof of Capacity, pre-compiled hashes stored on disk, BURST, using computing for scientific research, FoldingCoin or GirdCoin, also IOTA and XRP with no mining at all.

The jury is still out!

Exactly. I want to create a multi-asset platform, with all the bells and whistles of other software, but better, faster, smaller, fancier and very nice features.  
APIs have the issue of fragmentation. Every broker/exchange is using its own specific one, which is inflexible and takes a lot of integration/coding work. They are neither fast nor a standard. Same with FIX/FAST, it's not a strict standard.

Since either Digital Trade Chain DTC or FX Connect deal with the messaging mechanism, I am not sure how an additional transport mechanism would fit, outside sending proprietary data such as pushing automated trade recommendations.

The number of miners depends on the coin and it's popularity. Ethereum, GPU mined, is a lot less centralized than Bitcoin which requires ASIC hardware to be profitable.

The miner who mints the new block broadcasts a message to its nearby peers. It's the nodes responsibility to reply by a request of the new block from its peers.

[14:47](#msg5a48f89468d092bb620b2721)Well, there are a lot of transport mechanisms/serialization formats, which can be integrated into DTC or connect. Both are currently also supporting ProtocolBuffers. It would be straight forward to support FlatBuffers, Cap'n Proto, MessagePack, SBE.... The \[DTC protocol](http://dtcprotocol.org/) is a good choice, because it's open, free and supports many feeds already.

[16:21](#msg5a490e7468d092bb620b7c38)@BeardPower I am not 100% sure where does your project value proposition stand. On the crypto side you'll need to deal with many exchange API, including ICO platforms, hardware and software wallets.

Sounds like a job for an open source project. If you'd like to be the Bloomberg of crypto then integrate news.

Such Red open source layer covering the scope of crypto space, connecting exchanges and wallets, would turn Red into a major contender in becoming blockchain lingua franca.

Such library can justify a Red coin reward sized to incentivize contribution.

[17:29](#msg5a491e7ab48e8c356685a81c)@OneArb and @BeardPower, thanks. I will read up on DTC. I hope we have a chance, before networking schemes are all written, to see if we can create an FSM dialect to assist with protocol development. There are at least a few from R2 days. I think Doc and Gabriele's were more advanced in capability, while mine was more a top-down dialect experiment.

[17:32](#msg5a491f46edd2230811f92959)Turns out I was a miner years ago when I was incrementing values to find a match for MD5 phone numbers?

[17:37](#msg5a49203e0163b0281099554f)So is concurrency going to become one of the most important goals for Red?

[17:39](#msg5a4920edb48e8c356685b2c3)Slightly OT, I find it interesting how the pendulum swings between ease of use and flexibility, and performance. Not long ago I cam across an article about how to speed up string-to-integer conversions, low level stuff, because the overhead was impacting their server. The data was all JSON, so they were maybe going to move to a binary encoding, to avoid it altogether. Another case where, if we get it right, it should be almost a one-liner to switch to redbin format when it makes sense.

[17:43](#msg5a4921d9ba39a53f1abf7b01) I was looking at language benchmarks last night, and noticed that regex tasks varied widely by language and didn't necessarily line up with the overall speedyness of a language. Is that due to the chosen algorithm for each language?

[17:45](#msg5a49222f232e79134daed92d)For example, golang was mostly equivalent to java9 and faster on many tasks, but wayyyyy slower on regex task than java9

greggirwin

[17:47](#msg5a4922bdb48e8c356685bca5)Regex engines vary widely. May depend, too, on generated code. Golang still doesn't optimize, yes? While Java will JIT, and may win big time on something like regex.
