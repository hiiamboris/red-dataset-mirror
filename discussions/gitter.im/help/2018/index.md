[08:28](#msg5a4b42aa5355812e57408954)Is it possible to interact with Powershell today? If not, I guess it will be possible after advanced I/O is done!?

[23:23](#msg5a4c147d84fb74b9402e478b)How can I compile red.exe myself?

gltewalt

[23:36](#msg5a4c1775232e79134dbb8446)I do `do/args %red.r "-r %environment/console/console.red"` from Rebol repl

[23:37](#msg5a4c17adba39a53f1acbf36f)That is if you are in your local repo directory from Rebol console

[23:41](#msg5a4c18acba39a53f1acbf716)

```
To see the intermediary Red/System code generated by the compiler, use:

    >> do/args %red.r "-v 2 %tests/hello.red"

You can also compile the Red console from source:

    >> do/args %red.r "-r %environment/console/console.red"

To compile the Windows GUI console from source:

    >> do/args %red.r "-r -t Windows %environment/console/gui-console.red"

Note: the -c argument is not necessary when launching the Red toolchain from sources, as the default action is to compile the input script (the toolchain in binary form default action is to run the input script through the interpreter). The -r argument is needed when compiling the Red console to make additional runtime functions available.
```

BeardPower

[23:51](#msg5a4c1b1c232e79134dbb9539)But this is the REPL. I just want the "Red command-line front-end".

greggirwin

[18:35](#msg5a4d226d29ec6ac311b4df4c)There are various ways to do the file thing, as always. Once you have the names, if you read from a dir you're not in, you can prepend the dir name you read to each file. If you \*are* in a dir and read it, you get back relative file names. You can then use `clean-path` to make them absolute. That can be a nice, or dangerous trick. e.g. do a `read` on a dir, then print the `clean-path` of each file. Change dirs, and do it again.

[18:36](#msg5a4d22bbba39a53f1ad115fd)@gltewalt, I have an old file list lib for R2. The basics of globbing should be enough, and the hard part is designing your globbing dialect. I'm sure we'll see that built in, as it's very useful.

[12:51](#msg5a4f74cdb48e8c3566a2e312)@maximvl, the basics aren't hard, of course. It's when you want to generalize it, as some systems or libs do, that it gets trickier. e.g., supporting `**` as a recursion syntax, returning relative vs absolute names.

[17:09](#msg5a4fb163ba39a53f1add917a)I want to write a function `once` with a code block that will only execute the code once, like:

[23:02](#msg5a53f87d6117191e614028fc)It's an issue with `email!`. I originally expected to-email "ok" to return "@ok"

greggirwin

[23:04](#msg5a53f902ba39a53f1af0b475)You are correct, but it's a bit of a gray area. It's a good question to raise, though, as we need to write down the why and wherefore.

[23:06](#msg5a53f979ba39a53f1af0b64e)Email is a trickier type, because the sigil is actually a delimiter in the form. e.g. with file! or issue!, you can `form` them and the sigil goes away. Not so with email.

gltewalt

[23:06](#msg5a53f97ab48e8c3566b7a7a0)I made sense when @rebolek described how `logic!` can look like an ordinary work, like, `on`, but there isn't a lexical hint for logic values. Emails should have @ somewhere in there

greggirwin

[23:07](#msg5a53f9c55a9ebe4f7561e03a)But then you are modifying the data, not just coercing it to a different type. Not saying we can't, just that it's different.

greggirwin

[23:22](#msg5a53fd286117191e61404220)Well, it does do that for an empty string, simply because there's nothing to convert. The alt there would be to return a null char. In a single char string, you're good. In a multi-char string, it's not clear you only get the first, though that could be useful too, as you are possibly at an index in a string.

[18:17](#msg5a5658a383152df26d55c70b)On spreadsheets, using faces isn't a scalable option. We tried that in the old VB days as well. I've built grid and tree output using draw in R2, and it's scrollable and fine. What you do, then, and how real spreadsheets do it, is track the current cell and have a single `field` you move around for editing. However, for small spreadsheets, which a lot are, you can use the simple approach. Not as efficient, but may let you easily build small things that are very useful, with almost no effort. Anyone remember the work Steve Shireman and I did on that? Should be easy to port.

greggirwin

[19:35](#msg5a60f7125ade18be3992790b)@abdllhygt, let me suggest a possible alternative, after you've spent some time getting comfortable with parsing at the string level. If you make your scripting language a dialect of Red, you can use `load` on the input, then parse at the block level. What you're doing is still a great learning exercise, but you don't have to do all the low level tokenization if you work at the block level.

[19:39](#msg5a60f7ffb48e8c3566f94435)@abdllhygt as Gregg suggested, it's easier to leverage existing capabilities of Red instead of doing everything by hand, though, for that you'll need to change your specification a little. Remember that everything is a trade-off.

[04:46](#msg5a61782e6117191e6184753e)@abdllhygt Like Ruby, there are many different ways of doing things in Red. I thought that it might be interesting to automatically insert spaces when loading `(1+1)`:

```
Red []

system/lexer/pre-load: func [src part][
	digit: charset [#"0"-#"9" #"."]
	operator: charset [#"+" #"-" #"*" #"/"]
	paren: [ #"(" some digit operator some digit #")"]
	parse src [ 
		any [
			s: paren (
				insert find s operator " "
				insert find/tail s operator " "
			) 
			| skip 
		]
	]
]

foreach test ["(1+2)" "(3-4)" "(5*6)" "(7.0/8)"] [
	print mold load test
]
```

The output is:

```
(1 + 2)
(3 - 4)
(5 * 6)
(7.0 / 8)

kokenge

[16:19](#msg5a660ef45a9ebe4f75bd016f)This is my first quick look at REBOL or RED. Might be a stupid question, but can you write web application. Do you write HTML code with links to RED. Or can you make the application you create appear in a browser and be sent back to RED. I guess my question is, How exactly does it work with the web. What are the steps to develop a web app

9214

[16:20](#msg5a660f4c5ade18be39aae07a)@kokenge hi, welcome! Unfortunately not yet, though, there're plans to compile down to `asm.js` and, in the future, to webasm.

[16:21](#msg5a660fa1e014122650790448)@are1000 seems to be brewing in web developing, maybe he can say something more helpful

are1000

[16:28](#msg5a66112a5a9ebe4f75bd0f11)@kokenge right now there is no simple way to create webapps with Red. However you can look at using Red as CGI ( @rebolek can tell you more about it) or you can wait until Red/JavaScript transpiler is completed (I just started working on proof of concept). I think that in the near future (as soon as Red will have full IO and Webview built in) there will be some workarounds for this.

[17:02](#msg5a661932ae53c159031dc8d0)But, as I understand RedBin being some kind of "concise memory snapshot/representation of the code in memory", it has similarities with PB as a serialization format.

greggirwin

[20:30](#msg5a6649e9ce68c3bc74edf8c3)From Carl's article:

&gt; For encapsulated programs, there is also the extra advantage that developers can selectively remove symbols from the REBin symbol table. This allows commercial developers to do a better job of hiding their code

[20:31](#msg5a664a25ce68c3bc74edf9fb)As it's just data, we may also see refinements for `save/load` like, `/secure`, which add a key param.

BeardPower

[21:38](#msg5a6659e9d9f895c36049e6cf)@greggirwin So let's assume the following:  
There is a nice Red package manager call Repaman and I wrote a module called wdftlm.rm (rm for Red Module; world domination for the little man). Some user wants to download my module with Repaman and link against my module to use it within his code, but also keep it save from skiddies, not so much from very sophisticated crackers.  
Can this already been pulled of with the current state of Red? Is the code sufficiently protected? `/secure` could be great. E.g., encrypting it with AES, fetching the key through Repaman or the like.

greggirwin

[22:34](#msg5a6666ebce68c3bc74eea786)@BeardPower, as @gltewalt says, none of that is in place today. What we don't know is how this will all play out when we get to module design. Simpler is better, and there are a lot of old systems to learn from. @roobie and I were going to look at PkgMgmt ideas at one point, as I have a lot of old notes. But consider this new world of blockchains, where SemVer and lock/pack concepts meet. How does that all work?

Your module could live in a block, behind a contract, paid or not in some form, per use or per download, source code vs encrypted, etc. The package system could build packs of components into blocks, and maybe the runtime module system can even load them side by side. When you go to debug, you may have all source or, as with natives today, be linked to a system of record, or even get a "Nope, that's a secure piece of code you're trying to view." response.

[22:36](#msg5a66676a5ade18be39ad1e31)How to make it easy to use, secure, and maintain is the work. But a system like this could prevent things like the NPM leftpocalypse, but also means you, as an author, may give up rights to rescind work, or that's part of the contract. e.g., no new users can be accepted, but old users continue to get access, or can get the source via escrow.

BeardPower

[22:39](#msg5a66680e0ad3e04b1b563dc3)Absolutely, the d-Ledger opens very exciting new ways.

[22:40](#msg5a6668766117191e619c8da4)I need to research on some of the ledgers, maybe there is something tailored to "package managment". BigchainDB's ACLs could be used for it.

[07:46](#msg5a6adcf24a6b0dd32b4c242c)@Ungaretti I thought it had made it to the readme. `-e` means "encap" which works like rebol did. So you get a single EXE but all code is internally interpreted, so any issues that are compiler limitations can be worked around.

DideC

[21:40](#msg5a6ba03740259f1a33b06794)@abdllhygt faces are objects.  
in an actor, `face`refer to the face that run the function code (the first param of the actor function). Kind of `self` or `this` in other languages. `face/parent` point to the face that contain the current face.  
`face/pane` is a block where are stored the sub face of a face.  
So : `win: layout [button "bip"]` produce an object!. The word! `win` is set to it, and `win/pane`is a block with one element: yes, the "bip" button.  
And then, in an actor code, `face/parent/pane` means "the faces that are near myself in the face tree".  
Hope this help you understand a bit more above Rebolek's code.

[13:14](#msg5a6c7b52ae53c15903402da8)I found that the `-e` compiling option is essential. Not only it solves the "global variables inside functions" problem, but also solves an issue I was having where I had to close one view and open another layout. This only worked with `-e` option. Thanks for that @9214 !

9214

[13:17](#msg5a6c7be96117191e61bca2a8)okay then, it's a limitations of current bootstrap-phase compiler, IIRC Doc mentioned that most of them will be mitigated with JIT-compilation and features in `dyn-stack` branch

[13:21](#msg5a6c7cd56117191e61bca5a3)Also, on my trials, before the magical `-e` , I had to remove all `print`(debug) statements from the code to make it work. I'm not sure if `-e` would have solved that too.  
I'll try to isolate it to report a bug.

9214

[13:22](#msg5a6c7d19ce68c3bc740e650d)I can't remember fully, but there's a reason why `probe` and`print` wreck havoc after compilation

[15:53](#msg5a6ca07cae53c1590340d1c6)@Ungaretti IIRC you can also try compilation as usual with `[Options: [red-strict-check?: off]]` added to a script header

[17:49](#msg5a74a4ba4a6b0dd32b7f5b1c)I think the usage of `mezzanine` makes sense given its meaning, and there probably aren't many single words (maybe none?) that can fit that role. It just isn't part of my normal lexicon. I think if there are more common words that fit, and aren't ambiguous, it could make sense to use one of those instead. But there is also a big benefit to terms which are concise and have precise meanings. There are a lot of other jargony CS terms (more common in other languages) that I would apply to this situation, like `context`, `proxy`, `semaphore`, etc. etc. I wonder if other languages just don't really have the same 'layer' of things to talk about...

[06:46](#msg5a76ac397dcd63481f15bbe4)From \[the documentation of `date!`](https://doc.red-lang.org/en/date.html#\_runtime\_creation):

&gt; `year` and `day` fields are interchangeable, but only for low year values. The year can be used in first position \*\*only\** if its value is &gt;= 100 and less than the value of the third field. When that rule is not satisfied, the third field is considered the year. Negative years should always be specified in the third position.

How can the `year` be &gt;= 100 and less than the third field? The third field is supposed to be `year` or `day`. If `year` is used in the first position, then the third field is `day`, which ranges from 1 to 31, so `year`(&gt;=100) must greater than `day` in this case, right?

toomasv

[07:18](#msg5a76b3dbce68c3bc74416b55)@AT-Aoi Agreed, this doesn't make sense. (Logically, it says year can never be in the first position) Besides, year \*can* be smaller than 100 on first place, e.g. `001-1-31` and at the same time greater than the value of the third field, e.g. `032-1-31`.

```
>> 001-1-31
== 31-Jan-0001
>> 032-1-31
== 31-Jan-0032
```

[10:47](#msg5a76e4d5a3447aac753c57e7)OK, document speaks about runtime creation with `make`, and this indeed doesn't accept year values &lt; 100 in the first position.

[11:07](#msg5a76e969ac509d207db7d957)@AT-Aoi I think I got it: The confusing remark applies to the syntax with `to date!`, where day in third position can be day-of-the-year, e.g.:

```
>> to date! [365 1 364]
== 30-Dec-0365
>> to date! [363 1 364]
== 28-Dec-0364
```

But still, number in the first position is interpreted as year only if it is \*\*greater\** than number on the third position:

```
>> to date! [100 1 101]
== 10-Apr-0101
>> to date! [101 1 100]
== 10-Apr-0101

[14:26](#msg5a7c5e2a7084124a3450e1e4)because something like `some ["a" | "b"]` will match `bb` and `aa`, which is undesirable

>> parse parse [my apples or my pattern] rule
== false

But `fail` does not:

```
rule: [some [['my 'pattern | 'pattern 'my] [to ['my | 'pattern] reject | to end] | ['my | 'pattern] fail | skip [end reject |]]]
>> parse [my apples or my pattern] rule

greggirwin

[16:24](#msg5a7dcb2018f388e6268214a8)Have to think about semantic parsing. `Parse` is based purely on data and lexical forms, but actions allow you to do meaningful checks above that level. That means you could write a semantic parsing dialect and generate both rules and actions, yes? I think that's the way to go. Unless someone comes up with a way to make it work directly in parse without confusion. `Parse` is already one of the more advanced features of Red.

greggirwin

[20:10](#msg5a834641ce68c3bc748113b3)Vector over block is an optimization, e.g. if you want to do faster math like in J. You can think of them basically as arrays versus collections in other languages, trading flexibility for performance.

PeterWAWood

[22:27](#msg5a83666e7084124a34734cf3)Internally,Strings are stored as either ISO-8859-1, UCS-2 or UCS-4 depending on their contents. Chars are 32 bits. More processing is required when adding, removing or finding characters than in Rebol2.

greggirwin

[01:48](#msg5a8a2cf86fba1a703a6d3764)The semantics are slightly different for `tail?` and `empty?`. You can use `empty?` on `none!` values, which is convenient. Beyond that, it can be a more meaningful word, depending on what you're doing. Which of the following reads better to you?

```
if not tail? s: ask "Ready?" [print s]
; or
if not empty? s: ask "Ready?" [print s]
```

Or consider this.

```
blk: [1 2 3 4 5 6]
blk-ref: at blk 4
while [not empty? blk-ref][print take/last blk-ref]
```

Seems OK, yes? What about this then? (WARNING! This will hang your Red session.)

[07:44](#msg5a8d2343e4ff28713aa72790)@snotbubble  
1\. Selecting item in `tl` triggers its `on-change`  
2\. `tl`'s `on-change` calls `getdata`  
2\. `getdata` changes `tf/text`  
3\. Changing `tf/text` triggers `on-change` for `tf`  
4\. `tf`'s `on-change` calls `setdata`  
5\. `setdata` sets both first and second field of selected `sampledata`  
6\. Only then `td/selected`is set in `getdata`, i.e. already changed data.

I suggest to split `setdata` into two -- one for `tf`the other for `td` and call them separately in respective `on-change`actions.

(Also, I think you can use simpler syntax instead of parens, e.g. `sampledata/:x/2: fndata/:f` instead of `sampledata/(reduce x)/2: fndata/(reduce f)` and just `getdata sampledata tl/selected` instead of `getdata sampledata (reduce tl/selected)`)

[22:05](#msg5a8f3e908f1c77ef3a420463)@loziniak, the first thing I see is that `[function! [param [integer!]]]` isn't valid in a Red func spec. That is you can't, currently, match on a func arg's spec that way.

[22:13](#msg5a8f409c35dd17022edf9787)I'm happy to be corrected but I also think that your `num` compilation error is because `#system` doesn't magically know the Red func arg names.

[22:53](#msg5a95e16ee4ff28713ad5bcea)I could probably amend my SO answer, but the alternative I believe is to write a service module to replace e.g. CGI with a different handler. It would take a bit more work but may ultimately be a better fit.

PeterWAWood

[05:07](#msg5a978a8a8f1c77ef3a6b3f91)The current Red GUI backends are a native Windows backend and a native macOS backend. Red GUI backends could be written for both native or cross-platform UI frameworks (that have a C-style API).

It is most likely that a GTK+ will be included in the "standard" Red distribution at some stage in the future.

In fact, some members of the community have made a good start on a GTK+ backend.

It is not currently clear when a GTK+ backend will be available. I think we will get the first indication when the Red roadmap is updated to include the Red blockchain dialect.

[23:43](#msg5a9c848ee4ff28713af3af8f)I would like to make a script delay it's processing for 0,5 seconds. `wait` doesn't seem to be a good idea, since it doesn't behave well on console. I can' extract milisseconds from `now`. Create a face with a `rate` seems like too much for a silly delay. Any suggestions?

greggirwin

[03:04](#msg5a9e0531c3c5f8b90d39ec43)@snotbubble, et al, on the `path!` topic, I think there's possible confusion in how best to approach this, or how best to leverage Red types. `File!` values are a string type. There are some funcs that work on them, e.g. `split-path` that "know" about path separators, but the datatype itself doesn't. `Path!` values are block values, where each slot can contain a different type of Red value, though not every value type, and most commonly words. One thing they can't contain is a `set-word!` value in any slot other than the last value. If there is a `set-word!` in the \*first* slot, they are currently lexed as a `url!`, which is a different question, but may help explain why you can't treat these types interoperably or convert between them with complete confidence.

[03:06](#msg5a9e059d35dd17022e26bb8f)So, @snotbubble, my recommendation is that you \*not* use `path!` when trying to make file values. What we need are a few more mezzanines to make what you want to do easy and safe.

[03:12](#msg5a9e0717458cbde557fdd21e)@tsebb, here's a trick, and a way of thinking, last one first. In Red, think of how you can make data easier to operate on. Don't take the data as it is and assume you have to do it like other languages do. In this case, you have a bit string of single digits, yes? You could use `parse`, but that might be a little tricky as you're counting. So how to make it easy to just loop on? Here's the trick. Put a space between each digit and use `load` on the result. Now you have a block of integers, which is easy to operate on.

[20:00](#msg5a9ef37ac3c5f8b90d3f086f)I'm interested in creating a spinning wheel. I've seen at least one JS version which uses a library to do the animation. Since I can't easily see what the library is actually doing behind the scenes, I was wondering what you all think about the best way to spin an object is: 1. Creating a number of images and cycling; or 2: spinning the object programatically? Thanks in advance.

9214

greggirwin

[20:15](#msg5a9ef6e4f3f6d24c6844d03c)@maximvl, I fully support the goal of making things accessible. What would help here is concrete suggestions. I like `absolute-path` myself, and we can alias that easily if people want, but there's a reason Carl didn't use it. There's a reason for every word choice he made. "Clean" is shorter, that's one thing. Another is the goal of verb-noun naming. "Clean" is more verby. :^) Even `absolute-path` is jargon, yes? Maybe more people know it, but `fully-qualified-path` is even further down that spectrum, yes?

&gt; let's test it, what do you think dirize does, without checking help?

This is a specious argument. Show me a language where anyone can guess how everything works and I'll use it. The fact is that we have `help` and we can (and \*absolutely* should) write docs that help people find their footing when coming from other languages.

[16:37](#msg5aa55b538f1c77ef3aaac592)Is it possible to break from "higher level loop"?  
For example I have structure like this:

```
while [true] [
 print 'loop1 
 while [true ] [
    print 'loop2
      while [true] [
        print 'loop3
      ]
  ]
]
```

I can control only the most inner loop (`loop3`). When I put `break` there (after `print 'loop3`) it will only break from `'loop3` (so it will be in the `'loop2`).

9214

[16:45](#msg5aa55d0e458cbde557205e61)@nedzadarek you need to wrap nested loops in `catch` block and place `throw` in the deepest one
