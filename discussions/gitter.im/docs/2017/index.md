[09:19](#msg58774a0b300f220a66da3a70)@dockimbel I did a quick check of the libRed doc table of contents. The following are implemented but not described: `redSetEncoding, redOpenLogFile, redCloseLogFile, redVString, redVFormError`. Furthermore, file `%libRed.def` overlaps with the `#export` directive in `%libRed.red`, \*except* that `redUnset(), redPair(), redMold()` are not in `%libRed.def`.

dockimbel

[09:27](#msg58774c00873d96e16d5a69cc)@meijeru Thanks. I forgot to update `%libRed.def`.

meijeru

[09:29](#msg58774c8dcbcb2817705cb2cd)What is its use anyway??

dockimbel

[09:30](#msg58774ca811e7a7f61d873c9b)It's required for generating the libRed.lib file for Windows platform (it's VisualStudio-specific).

meijeru

[09:30](#msg58774cc7873d96e16d5a6db1)Pity for the double work, which -- as is shown -- may lead to inconsistencies.

[09:31](#msg58774ce211e7a7f61d873d3c)Could you not generate the .def file from the .red file?

dockimbel

[09:33](#msg58774d5cdec171b811dbc674)Yes, but it might be overkill, it is just a copy/paste of the `#export` list. Though, maybe a smart Red macro could do the job... ;-)

[10:06](#msg5877551c11e7a7f61d87675f)&gt; Are we also going to get libRedRT documentation at a certain point, or perhaps a more systematic guide to using the various toolchain options?

I was planning to document that in the blog release article, though, I might add a section in the docs about the toolchain anyway.

meijeru

[16:14](#msg5877ab64873d96e16d5c91ac)@dockimbel Trying to understand more of libRed: why is `%libRed.red` a `.red` file, when all the code it contains is enclosed in `#system [...]`?

[16:21](#msg5877ad27873d96e16d5c9c29)Another question: why are such useful series manipulation actions like `at`, `next` and `back`not implemented?

dockimbel

[09:09](#msg58789944300f220a66e1366e)@meijeru  
&gt; why is %libRed.red a .red file?

Because it needs to include the Red runtime library and Red modules (like View), which contain Red code.

[09:16](#msg58789ae5cbcb28177063ff2f)About your second question, the libRed API aims at being a simple glue for integrating Red into a host language/software. `redCall` can call any functions already, so the provided actions wrappers are just shortcut for the actions we think will be the most used. So `redSkip` already provides a navigation function, adding more brings no visible advantage to the user.

meijeru

[09:23](#msg58789caf300f220a66e148f2)OK Thanks.

[21:31](#msg58794749dec171b811e7792d)I was perusing the Gitbook and saw in the section on Reactive programming the following paragraph which I think has some formatting errors (and also a superfluous word `by`):

```
A reaction is removed by with the /unlink refinement and with one of the
following as a <source> argument: * The 'all word, will remove all 
reactive relations created by the reaction. * An object value, will remove 
only relations where that object is the reactive source. * A list of objects, 
will remove only relations where those objects are the reactive source.
```

dockimbel

[08:40](#msg5879e3e4074f7be763ccd4b8)It looks like a gitbook's processor bug to me, as it tries to interpret asciidoc tags from quoted text.

[23:30](#msg58854086cbcb281770a2b937)@dockimbel I am taking a quick look at the LibRed docs and came across:

"Ability to set/get a word's value from global or a local context."

Reading it pedantically, you could take that to mean that you can get and set words in the local context of a function. (I'm assuming that it is not possible to access a function's local context even with LibRed).

[23:32](#msg588540f5074f7be76304366b)Is it okay to change it to:  
"Ability to set/get a word's value from the global or an object's context."

[23:53](#msg588545fde836bf70107ab02d)@dockimbel If you call redOpen() a second time from a host program will the Red be re-initialised and all prior data lost?

The md-to-adoc conversion I made with the Notebook++ and the AscidocFX editors. Now, I have unified the formatting of translated texts with the english origin and put them into the new repo at the github.com/Tovim/docs page, where you can take them. Also, you can see it at https://tovim.gitbooks.io/docs. I would suggest to remove the README.adoc\[Ownership System] link in en/SUMMARY.adoc to the end of the list, which will simplify the bottom-arrow navigation as you can see in the Czech version. The double language en/cs fork is still a little smut in the face of the nice red-docs presentation.

[10:20](#msg589c42841465c46a564071dc)@PeterWAWood Thanks for the edits, I added mines too. You need to pass a `0` or `null` value to mark the ending of an arguments list.

pekr

[18:27](#msg58dd4e088e4b63533d7d4d9c)@Tovim I don't want to be harsh, but your translation of `face`being `pi≈°kot`(sponge cake) is imo just absurd and it makes me crazy each time I face it.

[18:28](#msg58dd4e568bb56c2d115c36a8)I already tried to explain to you, that face is simply a face, and R2 had even related "feel" aspects. I really can't understand why have you decided for such a translation?

[18:29](#msg58dd4e8c8e4b63533d7d5110)Maybe this is more a general question. We have not seen much translations in the Rebol ecosystem in the past. Would you translate and extensively use terms as face?

[18:30](#msg58dd4ed68bb56c2d115c397c)For me, personally, I would probably go in a reverse mode - use original english term and with the first mention I would provide the translation in a parens `face (tv√°≈ô)`and since then I would probably use the original term.

[18:31](#msg58dd4ef24cb8d0917341d23c)Because - where do we stop? Do we trasnate draw, shape, etc. and use it across our docs?

greggirwin

[18:54](#msg58dd546dad849bcf4235f93a)If terms have a specific, technical meaning, they should probably not be translated. Sort of like "food" having a translation in all languages, "hamburger" having adaptations, and "Big Mac" always being the same.

## Friday 31st March, 2017

iArnold

[07:09](#msg58de00b9408f90be6673c8a2)If the term face will be consistantly translated that would be wrong. It is a technical term one will see used in docs other languages so leave it untranslated so readers become familiar with the term. Rather give one detailed explanation of the used term when introduced. "'Face is the term you can think of it as the visible presence of a widget in a window, like the face of a person on a group photo" (&lt;-- that is probably very incorrect ) as long as it is giving the reader a clear idea to work from I believe that is a much better approach.

[14:13](#msg58de641c0e4137042acd58b8)Hi, @pekr , @greggirwin , @iArnold , glad to discuss with you.  
Face as a "sponge cake" (pi≈°kot) is certainly somewhat outrageous, I admit. Maybe I am wrong - the Red term face (short or interface) is what in some other languages is named as a "widget". Widget is a funny (meaningless) word in english but not so in czech.  
If a "face" is something like widget in english, why not "pi≈°kot" in czech?  
I agree with the view that technical terms should be translated with great consideration. I am going to revisit my translations and make corrections where necessary.  
@pekr , I¬¥d like to consult my prospective linguistic issues with you, would you agree?

rebolek

[14:19](#msg58de655f0e4137042acd5e96)I agree that "pi≈°kot" for "face" is not very good pick.

[14:44](#msg58de6b420e4137042acd7bf3)I am open to any discussion in that regard. The quality of translation is really good otherwise and kudoz for that. Let's just not make it a PhD linguistic topic - it should be really mostly practical ...

iArnold

[19:07](#msg58dea8e208c00c092a368dde)This just shows again that translation takes more than Google Translate. I'll leave the best Czech translations up to the specialists here. But this issue in itself is also valid for translations to other languages. As long as there are no better places to discuss the details I don't mind you proposing some better alternatives here. Perhaps there is also a wiki where a page can be edited?

[06:53](#msg58f85ad008c00c092a9a08d5)There's an internal partial implementation of `point!` used by Parse engine (to expose some stack slots to users in Parse callbacks), though, it has no literal form, as reusing the pair form would lead to hardly readable values: `453x73235x2345 or 12.3434x3.56722x16533.234`.

[06:53](#msg58f85b03cfec91927258541b)Actually even allowing decimal values in `pair!` already leads to hard to read values, IMO.

greggirwin

[07:17](#msg58f8608c8bb56c2d11c563a7)While I agree that `453x73235x2345` isn't pretty, neither is `732352x534567`. Decimals do make it even worse. I'm not sure I want to extend the separator (e.g. `1920_x_1080`), but the real question is how often the bad cases come up. `10x12x15` isn't bad. `1x23x456` isn't great. `1234x56x789`...but, and this is another consideration, if you look at numbers like this regularly, they may not seem as bad. I can't say. It's a tough call. Need to make that call, though, and say what people \*should* use if we don't extend pair.

dockimbel

[07:33](#msg58f8644dcfec919272587d25)Small numbers are fine, but as soon you get decimals in, readability drops quickly. That's the reason I haven't implemented decimals support in pairs yet, I wanted to solve that issue first. Though, I should implement it anyway in the next days, as we need it for Draw...

I know using `construct` in R2 was confusing at times, when dealing with loaded data (e.g. config files), where it wasn't clear whether users needed to use lit-word syntax, or just words.

\- ¬ß2.6 I believe `collect` and `keep` are considered keywords, just as `copy` and `set` are, even though they have same-named funcs in Red proper.

[21:04](#msg5a19dad971ad3f87362cd081)@greggirwin thanks Gregg - will fix as appropriate. Re 'all types are recognised' I can't get binary - e.g. #2{11110000 1111 0000} to work.

Red has slightly stricter lexing rules on binary than Rebol. Something to pose to @dockimbel when he comes up for air.

[18:18](#msg5a1da868232e79134de2911d)There are some typos in examples of `binary!`:

```
;base 2, with spaces
red>> #2{11110000 1111 0000}
== "11110000 1111 0000"
;base 64
red>> #64{ffff"}
== {ffff"}
```

`#2{...}` should be `2#{...}` and `#64{...}` `64#{...}`. Currently `== ...` shows only string `{...}`. Correct values for those examples are:

```
>> 2#{11110000 1111 0000}
*** Syntax Error: invalid binary! at "2#{11110000 1111 0000}"
>> 64#{ffff"}
*** Syntax Error: invalid binary! at {64#{ffff"}}
```

[18:28](#msg5a1daad1ffa3e37919cef008)Actually:

```
>> 2#{11110000 11110000}
== #{F0F0}
>> 64#{ffff}
== #{7DF7DF}
```

[18:49](#msg5a1dafa0ba39a53f1af6487f)@toomasv, do you mean on Red-by-example? If so, I think Mike has those on his fix-list already.

[17:23](#msg5a316226cc1d527f6b2984ec)Not sure if old blogs will get updated. Maybe the best thing we can do is make sure to point people to https://doc.red-lang.org/ for official docs.
