# PGO support

Hi!

I am curious - is there any Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) support in Red? If not, are there plans to add it in the future? Usually, targeting native-code compilers like GCC, Clang, and others support PGO.

For Red applications, it could bring additional performance improvements.
