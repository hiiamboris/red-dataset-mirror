This is not the place for ad spamming. If you wish red on scoop, cooperate your efforts with the team on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/red/red)

I'm not spamming ads I'm simply suggesting that it is published to scoop.

Actually, this sounded familiar so this is what I've found: https://github.com/red/scoop-bucket
