# Extensibility

Something I postponed until a better time, and it surely can wait.

User should be able to freely extend `format` with his own values. These are not just datatypes, but more generally a map of predicate -> formatter func. [Copying Spaces into clipboard](https://github.com/red/REP/issues/134#issuecomment-1370037862) provides a good use case here.

It also returns to [`class-of` and object identification topic](https://github.com/red/REP/issues/102).

Yes, like the Windows clipboard allows you to define custom formats.
Ultimately this aligns with MOP (Meta Object Protocol) thinking, which may
be a big change, and something that may not apply universally, unless
there's a clean way to support action dispatchers too.
