I asked on *gitter/gitter*. @greggirwin, perhaps you could become a Exercism maintainer with write access to github.com/exercism/red, is that what you mean by "granting access" and want to stay away from?

Yes. In the very near future (we hope) the Red DL will be the prebuilt console directly, so you can run instantly, but it's not that way yet.

@loziniak 

- You can include a literal none in maps with construction syntax: `map: #(message: #[none])`
- Be sure to `copy/deep` on your map templates for series in them. And look at ticket #2167 for gotchas.
- I would break out the prin/print/probe override/reset into helpers, to keep the main loop clean. Also note that to be like `print` your replacement should return unset.
- Some of the naming is a little confusing on a quick read. e.g. in the loop there's `result`, `case-result`, then `case` that uses `case-result` checks in it. 
- Since you make files names at the top already, I'd do that for the results file too, rather than having an `arg/3` reference  way down there.

When executing arbitrary Red code, there's no easy answer. When `protect` is added that will help, and modules should be restrictable, but we don't have those yet. In this case a catch is that you want it in your environment for the `print...` redefinitions. You've probably already thought of the inelegant solution of loading and binding to a context created for the runner (with words you want to catch).

> loading and binding to a context created for the runner

To be honest - not. Rebinding contexts is still a little bit of magic for me. I'll try to investigate this and maybe learn something useful in the process.

[22:20:38](#Dx_vrZ3wwOZ5ezBKm4E3nAK_Sf65u8fuA1m0JazDVS0) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
It *is* magic. :^) Partly because you can't see it, but also because we don't think of contexts as a thing that exists in natural language. So moving the same word around in contexts is an unnatural act.

## 14-Apr-2021

[4:16:34](#Zkb9oHbIjfLaAu8dZ_6GkuUYkJZ8daDraW6o5aOS-cY) <toomasv>:
How so? Context in natural language is ubiquitous. We don't think of it because it is literally everywhere and we switch contexts all the time naturally. But in Red context switching is more explicit and we don't have ambiguous contexts (except in our heads) as in NL.

[16:33:04](#vyTh6clCaNGF9BSXwSMn6ME2UdhAIt7Qw6ZbRzicZBY) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
@toomasv what I mean is that you can't take a word out of one context in NL and put it in another, where the same word also exists in a different context. e.g. the old `spoon` example just becomes a madman's mantra. The "rock" example from @9214 strikes is different, and makes your point, so maybe there's a meta element here in contexts as data structures versus contexts as part of language. The structure of a sentence provides context in NL, but arbitrarily reassigning context without that "ordered, semantic container" leaves you in the dark about what a word's context might be.

Your word choice with "explicit" is interesting too, because we *can* write dialects that support implicit context changes, though they'd necessarily be more advanced than simple word matching.

loziniak (Maciej ≈Åozi≈Ñski): I've been casually interested in Excercism for a while, but now that there is someone driving this effort, it feels like the little chunks are small enough that I can actually contribute. I really appreciate your effort on this!
I was thinking more about the exercise test runner, and the part which feels a little awkward to me is editing the file and knowing to change the `ignore-after` field. That and switching to use the example solution. What would you think about adding some optional arguments to the test script to specify how many tests to run, and a way to target the example solution?
I should probably look at some other language tracks to see how they are doing it, but that was just based on my impression. I haven't seen yet how this compares with a user of the track vs someone adding examples.

[23:59:38](#MdZmyhDDtr0T6fGnICj7fNsLxfQuL7jtuE5Q1FoGr0c) <loziniak (Maciej ≈Åozi≈Ñski)>:
Hi @zentrog:matrix.org . Thanks for contributions so far, the greatest of them is just being here and participating, so it doesn't feel being on my own anymore :-)
The test script is certainly not perfect, the main problem being the code repeated in every exercise and I don't have a clear idea how to get over it.
Editing the `ignore-after` value is a little awkward for me too, but it's just like this in every other track. Usually they use some testing framework, and all (except the 1st) test cases are manually bypassed ([csharp track example](https://github.com/exercism/csharp/blob/main/exercises/practice/darts/DartsTests.cs)). Personally, I'd just enable all tests by default, although I think I've read somewhere, that enabling tests one-by-one is a recommended practice in TDD. Having this as an optional argument is probably ok. Perhaps @iHiD would have a say here?
Switching to example solution is done only, when creating exercise. Final users "consume" the example just by copying it to main example file, which they then test.

Oh, wow. Removing the Skips is way more cumbersome!
If it helps, I think what you have so far seems great. And the fact that the test scripts can be auto-generated means they could potentially be updated the same way. I don't think it is a high priority, but I thought I should mention it to see if you think it's something worth pursuing.
The idea I had was something simple like the first time you run the tests, it would give a hint like
```
red --cli darts-test.red
Running 1 of 13 tests...
<test results>
Run "darts-test.red 2" to run the next test
```
Then you just need to press <up> and change the number each time

I'd probably go rather for the argument being a number of tests to run, than number of a test. Then user can easily fire all the tests at once. And if making test *n* pass would break any earlier tests, it will be evident.
Thanks for warm feedback. In fact, I thought also about automatic updates. Just didn't need it so far. And keeping custom changes intact (like for example adding few track-specific test cases) would need some thought.

That's actually the way I was thinking about it as well - the number would just set ignore-after if it was present. The reason for that message is more to provide a hint as to what to do next, not explicitly describing the usage of the command

loziniak (Maciej ≈Åozi≈Ñski): Thanks for the link!
I found an interesting issue with the sgf-parser exercise, which is that the canonical data uses the property "parse", which makes the generated code use that name for the exercise stub function. That causes an obvious conflict with `parse`. The simple fix would be to just rename those to something that doesn't conflict. But it raises the question of whether there needs to be a mechanism to remap certain names, because it breaks the automation for that exercise.

@zentrog:matrix.org I think it's just fine to rename it, as currently we don't have exercise re-generation code. I think when we do, then we'll start to worry. I think there will be little cases like that, and we can deal with them by manually merging changes with git to preserve edits. If it will be too much work, then perhaps would be a good moment to start thinking about renaming in case of system/words conflict.

@loziniak thank you for the exercises! A couple points:
1. It's not always obvious what format the results should be in. Example: I'm doing resistor-color-trio now, and it _seems_ to require a map, but I'm not entirely sure... initially I thought it was just a string
2. "How to debug" - it would be great if one could see the exact errors they were getting on that website, instead of copying code to and from their local console. Not sure how feasible this is, though.
Again, thank you for making these available!

total $100k donated in 2 years - it's like what? 2 months of teams salary? if these numbers are to be trusted, their data trading income must be like 10x bigger

maybe not so full-time :)

Maybe they have some other sources like grants... or just earn less than 8k per month..

I had an impression, that everybody can mentor. There's no info, that there are any requirements. Do you have any error message, or just can't access mentoring page?

I'd have to check again. I think it stopped me.

 * a couple of points about exercism

- one needs at least 20XP to mentor
- some exercises are frustrating :( "high scores" is rather vague in requirements: there is a block coming in as param of all functions, yet some are expected to modify it. Looking at "latest score after personal top scores" - there's a block of scores (oddly enough already sorted high to low), then personal-top-three is called with that block of scores, then somehow that block is modified and "20" is removed, leaving "30" to be the returned result?

I will always appreciate the effort put into Red, by builders and all the people working on it, just so people don't think I'm ungrateful :)

I'm giving up on Exercism, I find it too frustrating... Take "High Scores" - the [sample C# implementation](https://github.com/exercism/csharp/blob/main/exercises/practice/high-scores/.meta/Example.cs) seems straightforward enough, pretty much what I'd do. [The Ruby sample](https://github.com/exercism/ruby/blob/main/exercises/practice/high-scores/.meta/example.rb) - same. 
Looking at the requirements, though... 
"Scores after personal top scores" takes [30, 50, 20, 70] and returns the same numbers, in the same order? was there any processing expected on that list? hard to tell..
"Latest score after personal best" takes a list of scores and returns the last item - same question, was there anything at all expected to happen there?
"Scores after personal best" takes 5 element list and returns it (or a copy, maybe), unchanged.

I've never played the classic game Frogger, surely that's why I'm not getting this.

[I'd forked the repo](https://github.com/riprwwa/exercism-red/) thinking I could help make it better and give back to the community, but now I remember struggling through a few other problems before, not understanding the requirements, the expectations of the solution... the Simple Game Parser was one. And a few other bits are puzzling, like repeating the test lib in every exercise? I mean, making some changes to Red's track might actually hinder it, if it makes it different from the cannonical...

/rant, sorry, got carried away

Practice exercises (what the Red track has) have canonical test data and docs sourced from an upstream problem-specifications repo that all Exercism tracks can use. Each `X after Y` test is checking immutability for tracks where that might be a concern. Personal top score shouldn't affect the scores being looked at.   Getting the personal best shouldn't change the latest score and so on. However, the way the Red test suite is set up, we can only test one function per canonical case so those tests shouldn't have been included. I'll go ahead and mark them as not included and update the test suite.

[2:19:07](#0QiENl-KQlol1idInDof7C5eOP01dNT7HZ6QPPsagQQ) <BNAndras (BNAndras)>:
Changes like Red-specific tests can certainly be discussed for specific exercises. The test library needs to be in each exercise by design because there's no built-in test framework for Red like in some of the other tracks. Students should have everything they need to run the test suite for each exercise.
