Today I discovered a flawn in the new level 15, when the boy drives the wheelbarrow, due to the larger size of the widget 
he can access the quicksand river, I have enjoyed walking around there and I think I will leave it as a trick as the guards

Hello guys, would like to learn few bits about Red / Rebol GUI lower level architecture and am not able to depict it from looking into sources, so here goes my questions:

1) I can see some activity in the Direct2D backend branch. What exactly is going to be accelerated? Is that some lower level elements as drawing images, windows, or is that the whole backend, including text and some other widgets? 

2) Is Direct2D backend going to work on all supported Win versions? Or is there any split, e.g. Win7 using GDI or a mix, and Win8.1+ using D2D, etc.?

3) Thinking about GOBs, as there is a dedicated branch for them too, I am curious about the Text element support. In R2, there were 2 separate text engines, View's one, and Draw level one. R3 has added GOB's one. Red hase rich-text too. What is the situation with text support in Red? I mean - if I want nice big scrolling non-jerky text, should I use Draw, or ... will D2D backend help here having stuff faster/smoother?

[11:20:59](#70G_WBma5oL-DdF_NuvRQdW2Vs3DUPw9XQbu4Y05vAQ) <hiiamboris (NOT THIS ONE)>:
1) Speed is probably of lesser concern here. Current situation is: you can work with text only on `rich-text` face, not on a `base` face, and you can use draw commands on `base` face but not on `rich-text` face. So how do you combine text and shapes? Not possible.

`base` uses GDI and GDI+ mix on Windows. GDI is just very limited and GDI+ is just very very buggy, and they also mix badly. `rich-text` is using DirectWrite engine, in which it is possible to render to a GDI surface, or to a D2D surface.

I do not know the core team's reasons for D2D migration, but as far as I can see it's a (logical) escape from complexity and bugs of the GDI\* technologies. Faster rendering speed of all Draw commands should come as a bonus probably.

2) D2D and DWrite both work down to Vista. Hopefully there'll be no split once the work gets finished.

3) Can't comment on GOBs, but D2D will only affect `draw` block. Maybe some other `base`-related code (e.g. how `base` renders it's `text` facet?) as well.

Great answers as always, thanks for that. As I said - in R2, we've got face/text and that was our very basic text mode. Later on, Cyphre has added AGG support and Draw was able to draw text too. Some nice demos appeared. Later on, R3 added Gob and its text element. I got somehow lost, what could/should be used in what situation :-)

Vista should be pre Win7 period, IIRC, so we should be all good set with D2D then and no split. Not sure, if the WinXP compatible mode is still there, but from what I remember, it was abandoned?

Sometimes I though, if there should be just a draw mode and nothing else? Imagine - you can do some effects and text in a Draw mode, but then we've got a face level text and face level effect pipeline (not yet with Red). To effectively combine them might be cumbersome. But then there might be some Draw mode related worries/impacts?

Great link @Oldes. It would be instructive for someone to do some research and see how others do it. We have UI related issues, for games and playing media, and we also have profiling and sampling situations. @giesse and Nenad, I think, both worked on a timer queue system for R2. I'll have to dig out the code for proper attribution, but it worked well at the mezz level. Then it's a question of whether timer ports work like they did there, or if another mechanism is used.

What Gabriele has used, IIRC was some trick of how to "eat" the non useful events, so that Rebol could get faster processing of event queue?

[10:53:48](#G5HA4FSnLcDZhm3W0wb6hyiQYJWZPVZf9HBTKA5k7_U) <giesse (Gabriele Santilli)>:
Right, the problem with R2 was that events were queued and if you were not processing them as fast as they were generated a very noticeable lag would ensue. I just did some simple event compression (ie. if you had 10 mouse move events in the queue, just process the most recent one, not all of them). That got rid of the lag almost all the time (ie. unless the user was clicking stuff very quickly). I think Romano had a more sophisticated approach but I don't recall the details right now...
Either way, this seems more like an optimization problem, and should be rather orthogonal to how events etc. are processed.

reposition: does [other/offset: main/offset + as-pair main/size/x + 7 0] 
view/no-wait other: layout/flags [title "Other" box] [no-min no-max]
view/no-wait main: layout/flags [
    title "Main" 
    on-resize [reposition print "Resized"] 
    on-resizing [reposition] 
    on-close [unview/all] 
    button "Other" [view other]
][resize no-min no-max] 
```
If you resize "main" window from left or upper border, no `resize` event is firing. 
After closing "other" window, `resize` event on these borders is firing.
After reopening "other" window, no `resize` event again.

Now, modify code by setting it e.g. `on-resizing [other/offset: face/offset + 200x0]`. Now resizing from top and left border will not fire `resize` event. 
I.e. those borders that affected repositioning of the "other" window during `resizing` events will not fire `resize` event. 
Is it expected?

@hiiamboris Thanks! Font scaling is just to prove it can be done...Not that it should. The full API (no where near to completion) allows any element of a face to opt-out of being rescaled, eg:
```
  ignore: ['font 'offset 'pane ' draw 'size]
```
eg You might want to not rescale DRAW because it's a fixed-size icon.

Font-scaling is difficult....If a parent face grows by (say) 20% x 45% then it is obvious how to rescale a child face's size. But what does that mean for a font!? The demo code has some heuristics, but they are not ideal.

Yes. In the current design, they have to call the API to let us know.
It would be nice to be able to pick that up from a reactor (The API kinda does that for offset now). But the API is also changing the size, and so don't want that to trigger also the reactor.

Should be no rounding errors in current design - it captures the state of the parent (eg size etc), so we exactly know the % change in each case.

Yes, that was my approach too. But when the size changes, you have to recapture it. And if it changes often, and the system resizes it often between it's changes, it accumulates.

@hiiamboris We may be talkimg about slightly different things. But I am confident the design I have is pretty much immune to accumulated errors.

Part of the API's state of a child face is that it is (eg) 8.6882% x 30.7780% of its parent's size. No change to the parent's size will affect that scaling factor. If the child's size changes, we recalculate that scaling factor from the exact new parent size.

Part of the issue with your oscillator is that it assumes a fixed size - it has hard-coded sizes.

That type of case is (partially) handled correctly with the one-hand clock in the demo - the hand can be rescaled between ticks, and appears to work correctly because the tick-code works on percentages from the current location of the clock's shaft, - not on absolute values.

Still, I am sure there are plenty of edge cases that can break the demo. More, please!

And it points to the need for carefully designed code for any layout that could be resized by an API.

I think the main difference between your oscillator and my clock is that the STATE of the clock is held in an object - the clock itself is just a drawing. That's why it can be resized too small to be of use - even to 0x0 - and then brought back.

If the oscillator had the same MVC design, then it *probably* (I'm wary of claiming things untested) would resize rationally/

@hiiamboris inevitable drift due to accumulated errors. **You are absolutely right** it's an insoluable problem....Sorry for being slow in realizing what you already discovered :)

Actually, it is maybe solvable if you allow "application hinting" - ie if an app knows that two fields are meant to be abutting, it can use a callback to correct any drift.

Or change the whole method of LAYOUT to  specify  boxes relative to each other, rather than independently placed on a pane. Like CSS does.

@greggirwin Thanks. Sounds like several people have tackled this sort of problem before - so maybe if we pool ideas we can make something work.

Hiiamboris has pointed out it is not possible to be pixel perfect as continual resizing of independent faces will create drift.

But we can do something that works for most "static" layouts.

And a "hinting" DSL might help with the drift problem (fonts in the real world come with sizing hints for similar reasons - so no reason why we should let that problem stop us).

[20:34:13](#XOWVXscDqtgguGVBViS4-RwXT-MeanQ9UkkQKlAve3o) <Respectech (Respectech)>:
A way that might help to avoid drift is to record the original position as part of each face. Then, when resizing, always use the original position as the base of the calculation.

 I'm already doing something like that. But hiiamboris has found ways to break it when a user manually resizes (or repositions) a single face in a tree of resizable faces.

I've got some ideas to retain a higher degree of accuracy .... But I think he's right, and those ideas only delay the inevitable.

We  need more ideas - and  more ways to break them - that way lies progress :)

I remember it took way longer to develop than it should have, but it gave some experience. I'm also inclined to think that the best resize model is one that learns from past mistakes.

@hiiamboris My approach was at first to borrow from other tool-kits. For the VID Extension Kit, it was the spring based system in MacOSX/NextSTEP, because it was simple and produces predictable results, because there is no weighting, but provides full pixel accuracy. If you play around with old versions of XCode or the GUI builder in GNUstep, you can quickly see how it works.

It's one that can be implemented fairly easily, though it was not fully implemented in VID Extension Kit.

It was done by doing traversal through the face tree inward, calculate the size of each face and then faces inside it, and using initial positions of all faces during first layout to move and resize faces, when the outer window changed size. If the face becomes too small for anything inside it to fit, that's too bad. Whenever a face provided a custom resize function, it would use that one instead.

Second, I worked a bit on the resizing model in Saphirion's RebGUI (I was not part of the R3 effort, but I provided some consultancy). It's similar to VID Extension Kit, but does not provide a good initial setup option. This means that horizontally stretching faces placed on top of each other will not share the same size, if the bottom one happens to be wider. Furthermore, having a unit system instead of pixel based system requires a lot of extra custom resize calculations for faces that might be placed in opposite corners to place them with pixel accuracy. Furthermore, it resizes using size differences from previous sizes. This leads to problems, when the window size change event cannot be captured by R2, such as during minimize, leading to a destruction of the layout and a blank window.

I don't think the RebGUI system is very good, overall.

@hiiamboris For the **R3** effort, the system was weighted, and my only real contribution there was to offer ideas on pixel accurate resizing of weighted faces. I did not like this system either, as I found weighted layout systems hard to produce good layouts in.

[0:24:29](#Jg0mdAqOJLKxziQSCOquOeEwSzyqvZrbOoBVqy2WtFk) <henrikmk (Henrik Mikael Kristensen)>:
@hiiamboris As part of a recent non-REBOL UI effort at Saphirion, I did two studies on resizing.

For the **first**, I made a prototype, which used a number of extremely simple face distribution and resize models. This basically was a system, of about 10 different, very small, resize algorithms, which are only capable of distributing and resizing the faces in the current pane.

That means, each pane in a face can have its own resizing model.

Each resizing model would simply be described with one word, such as V-BALANCE, H-BALANCE, V-SPLIT, H-SPLIT, FLOW, SPRING, GRID, ABSOLUTE, DISTRIBUTE, CENTROID, etc. You would extend the number of methods as you needed them.

Some models have very specific restrictions, such as only being able to handle one face in a pane. CENTROID will for example, place the one child face directly in the center of itself, if there is a child face.

I realized then also that instead of creating face styles, the resizing model itself became the face word, which made the layout dialect very simple, such as:

```
spec-layout [
	win: h-balance color red [ ; red window with H-BALANCE resizer
		centroid color green style button
		centroid color yellow text "Boo"
		centroid color blue [
			absolute size 10x10 color black
		]
	]
]
```

In that way, the face style becomes a secondary word rather than the primary word.

And so, it became very easy to make fairly complex resizing schemes using just these words, and I think it could solve the problem of mixing weighted and non-weighted resizing, because it could do that with little effort.

To further manage size relationships, I created a system called Channel Links, a concept directly borrowed from MODO. In the layout dialect, you would use the DRIVE word to specify one dimension in one face (height) to drive a dimension in another face (width). Further relationship descriptions would be possible with the MOVE-SNAP and RESIZE-SNAP words, to create self-driving move and resize relationships between faces.

I did not manage to solve whether the resize model should be bidirectional (outward, then inward) or unidirectional (only inward).

I did also not manage to solve a lot of bugs in this prototype, as time ran out, so the prototype was stored in the archive. It needs a couple of do-overs to become viable.

[0:25:48](#gql1oRun5CFQ2kc3aLAiBNcIeMTuovUql-CKzQXMWTg) <henrikmk (Henrik Mikael Kristensen)>:
@hiiamboris For the **second**, I created a prototype for a vertex based constraint model.

I copied ideas from 3D modelers like Blender, MODO and Maya, particularly rigging of rigid bodies, which is plainly algebraic relationships between different shapes. Each face has 9 vertices distributed over it, and you would specify the position of corner vertices to resize and move the face. Individual vertices of other faces could be constrained to positions on the face and have them follow each other, or resize dependently.

The vertices follow a rectangular resize rule, so in order to resize a face, you'd constrain the top left vertex and move the bottom right vertex, and the other 7 vertices follow.

The idea was then that vertices in one face could be linked to vertices in any other faces to develop a size relationship.

Furthermore, separate sets of individual custom vertices covering a face or the window area can be used as constraints to produce margins and guides.

This prototype has been shelved due to some difficulty in managing hundreds or thousands of vertices as words. I later resurrected it again for a new resizing DRAW dialect, which I will work on again soon. This one uses enumerated vertices in a path system.

I personally think a hybrid model with many small resize models, along with a vertex constraint model is the way to go.

That all is bit too complex to my taste, but I guess tastes vary. Still, it's interesting to see such different approaches. Custom resize functions is a great idea.
It would be nice to know the meaning of the terms you use, as google is of no help. E.g. does 'spring' model mean smth like `(size-change-1 / size-1 ** 2) = (size-change-2 / size-2 ** 2)`? Does 'weighting' mean that we distribute only freed space (that is `size - initial-size`) according to given weights, or we also initially size faces according to given weights? Do we split the space linearly? What do 'balance', 'split', 'distribute' models do?
I also guess that in 9-vertices model some conflict resolution algorithm is required, right?

@hiiamboris > E.g. does 'spring' model mean smth like (size-change-1 / size-1 ** 2) = (size-change-2 / size-2 ** 2)?

The spring model places 6 springs for each face. Outside the face: top, left, bottom, and right. Inside the face: horizontally and vertically.

If you want to right/bottom align a button in a panel, you would give it a top and left spring. Then it sticks to the right/bottom side of the panel.

If you want the button to follow the width of the panel, then do not place any outer springs, but one horizontal spring inside the button face.

For initialization (alignment phase), you give it an initial size and optionally any pixel position. Then for the resize phase, springs take over 100%.

This method provides no weighting, but provides very stable, pixel accurate GUI layouts.

> Does 'weighting' mean that we distribute only freed space (that is size - initial-size) according to given weights, or we also initially size faces according to given weights? Do we split the space linearly?

I think in the R3 GUI, you can do both. If you specify a size for a panel, then it won't grow, when you add more widgets inside it, and the widgets will shrink, otherwise it will just grow.

In the R3 GUI, you specify a min-size and max-size for that panel and for every widget which may not resize beyond certain restrictions.

The problem with this approach is that you need to provide a lot of extra restriction information to produce a reasonably consistent UI that doesn't scale like a fun-house mirror.

> What do 'balance', 'split', 'distribute' models do?

SPLIT - Takes two faces and divides the parent space vertically or horizontally. A value between 0 and 1 determines where the split position exists. Useful for user adjustable panel splitters.

BALANCE - Takes N faces and divides the parent space vertically or horizontally according to a set of weight values. Useful for tables.

DISTRIBUTE - Takes N faces and distributes them evenly along the width or height of the parent face in a grid. Then the faces are placed in the centroids for each grid cell. Useful for icon panels, where each icon can have different sizes.

> I also guess that in 9-vertices model some conflict resolution algorithm is required, right?

The only conflicts you might have would be circular references, and it might be possible to build very strange behaviors between faces, if you link dimensions between them inappropriately, such as face A's height becomes face B's width.

I admit this is not fully explored yet, but some way of figuring out calculation order is needed, but it should not require any solvers. It might be so that describing calculation order directly is necessary.

@hiiamboris I think I understand what you mean. you don't move multiple faces at the same time. if you were to randomly position A, B and C, you would do so, one at a time. the end result of D's size and position is the result of moving first A, then B and then C.

No, it would not. It would move distinctively as 100% relative to the vertex A, B or C that is currently moving. If evaluation is bidirectional, D is holding all vertices, A, B and C in fixed positions relative to each other.

For most of that to be possible with faces, VID has to transform from a *lay out once* approach into *re-lay out on demand using initial spec and preserving current faces objects intact* approach.

@hiiamboris Something for considerationâ€”Rebol 2 allowed for this but didn't use it: having non-faces in the PANE block. I've considered the possibility of taking advantage of that to include some of the non-face keywords to retain that information. For example, if you say: **at 50x40 some-face**, to retain the **at** command (however it is to be reinterpreted), it'd be better to store that separately than tie it to **some-face**. My primary thought is to store them in blocks to avoid clutter and ignore keywords that are not recognised (for forward compatibility). Thus such a pane might appear thus:
```lisp

`at` means location is fixed, so not for moving. Size on the other hand.. VID doesn't have enough info to deal with it yet, so it's up for extension dialect.

On layouts and resizing. There is a central tension we may not be able to resolve. In one scenario VID is great, because you don't need anything more. In another scenario you have a complex resizable layout with multiple areas,  user controlled splitters, and a mix of styles that may have different internal sizing constraints or connections (absolute, relative, anchors, transitions, padding/edges/margins). And let's add one more little feature into the mix: semantic layouts, a.k.a. responsive design.

Between those two extremes lie most software. The world has changed and people want shiny, they want transitions, they are on phones (which rotate their view) more than desktops, single-purpose UIs are wildly popular. Complex UIs UIs follow patterns, almost like everyone is using the same template. Chat App? 2-4 columns `[opt meta-nav  |  nav  |  content  |  opt details]` Mail client? [5-pane layout](https://gist.github.com/greggirwin/b34b082ecdf17589a6f82ac4e23fff65).

Fixed layouts have a shortcoming in a phone context, where every app runs full screen. Atronix had a really cool "semantic zoom" feature in their ZOE system, where each UI element had attributes related to the current zoom level, so it could render itself appropriately. Their take on responsive design in an infinitely scalable world where a single UI might have 60K elements in it. That's right. 60'000.

A UI has to make the best use of the space available, which may be an 80" 8K display, HD desktop monitor, retina-based tablet, phone, watch, or even a single pixel. The latter sounds ridiculous, I know, but it isn't (think minimap). It also has to consider that a human is on the receiving end, otherwise it's an API, and that single pixel is an aggregate summary of state which may be further aggregated. :^)

Zooming back to a 1:1 view, the most basic apps (which are legion in number) need to be as easy to write as VID is now, resize enabled by default, and smart(ish) when not given any other clues. To me this says that styles each have standard resizing rules, they don't all have the same behavior by default. Buttons should not grow and shrink but content fields like areas should. And when one item is the primary content area, it becomes greedy about using space. That's not a percentage or size, just a facet. It may not be a logical one. Maybe `primary` and `secondary` map to weights but you could specify weights (importance to user) directly as well.

Under the hood, there may be simple and complex engines used to create the layout. We do need to normalize on what facets faces need, but that extra weight can just be ignore by the simple engine. The complex engine by it's very nature will have a lot more than can go wrong, and a lot more knobs and levers to twiddle. The idea then is to hide as many of them as possible behind templates and specialized layout wrappers. When you need fully custom control of every detail, you can look at what those tools generate to learn and write a lot of tedious code; but that should be 0.05% of apps (not an evidence-based estimate, but 0.01% sounded extreme). The rest of the time you find a close template to what you want, and when there isn't one, somebody builds it. And because of who we are ("we" being Red), those templates can be living, breathing things.

I'm thinking there's a game here. There's a light source (the sun) and you have objects in the sky you position. The sun moves across the sky, and the shadows are cast like in @toomasv's raycasting demo. Your job is to have shadows hit or miss things on the ground as the sun arcs. Maybe you have fixed shapes to work with, or can create your own. Higher scores for the least number of shapes or their area used. Start with easy "total coverage" levels using different shapes. Then have plants that need sun, maybe they even grow and are worth more the bigger (more sun) they get. What if there are 2 suns or objects with different opacity?

The game idea could even be done just like @toomasv's demo as a different kind of game, maybe as heist context. The source is the security scanner, and you have a limited number of items to use to conceal yourself in shadow. It could be interactive or turn based, where you plot your path then watch it play out. Interactively, you have to run from left to right, placing items as you go. Different scanner speeds, spreads, cycles, and styles come into play. Maybe at first you can just run, later you might have something you use to knock out the scanner, but need to be within range.

The discussion about the layout being just a one way ticket is as old as Rebdbol (View) probably is :-) I do remember some discussions about re-layouts, being a two-way things. Those attemps usually ended with some models of resizing. I do remember ones from Romano Paolo Tenca, Dockimbel, Cyphre, Ladislav, sorry if I forgot others. Saphirion's R3 GUI had different models for various panel types.

 I found it quite interesting, because - what I have also ALWAYS missed, was a Redbol GUI higher order concepts - the whole GUI is just basic widgets, which end-up with GUI organisation in tabs, if you are lucky. But shouldn't we start with just wired models of screens, panels, splits? Those being resizable, rescallable, with at least a bit predictable behaviour of not messing the elements around your screens? 

I would even dare to call such new GUI system just Panels, Boxes, Rebox (which is close to popular Roblox :-) ), but the name surely does not matter much. Hence I am fully after Docs ideas in the above PR. I think, that Redbol GUIs really deserve an up-to-date aproach.

@hiiamboris The core of Rescaler **is** the two actors ON-RESIZE and ON-RESIZING (one triggers when user drags the window; the other on Max/Min keys). We also may need to consider ON-ZOOM (I haven't looked at that yet).

Most of the Rescaler API is settings to control what happens the those actors trigger.

Steal as many ideas as you like from Rescaler :-) - The end goal is for there to be a good API for fluid and responsive LAYOUTs - I don't care whose API it is :)

That's not what I meant. Faces except `window` do not get this event, so why not use it in place of custom hinting function or how you call it.

[15:00:37](#jWNmvVsZCeXVBDpSepq8XHYoUkTzBK2lMvOASPj-Z7E) <hiiamboris (NOT THIS ONE)>:
`on-zoom` will work on Android only I think, so not quite useful yet.

[17:03:29](#T-dFXnFTRpxsNTwlLErWyJVXsXuGaaBg5CzH-YAVJEE) <dsunanda (dsunanda)>:
@hiiamboris I think we may be talking at slightly cross-purposes here. The custom hinting is for cases like this:
```
view/no-wait [a: area 100x30 "I'm an Area" font [size: 10]
     b: button 50x50 "I'm a button" font [size: 11]
]
```
Whether by ON-RESIZING or API, swap the sizes of the faces. It is not entirely obvious (at least not to me) what the font sizes of the two faces should rescale to.


[17:05:25](#3K1zExEdLVqxo2no_ZmFlwHeQgFwCQRSPvcVrbiCixA) <dsunanda (dsunanda)>:
And hinting is made a bit more challenging as SIZE-TEXT is inaccurate - it claims that both of these fit their margins, but they don't - and by different amounts (at least not on my machine):
```
view/no-wait [a: text 50x50 "01234567" yellow font [size: 10]
     return
     b: button 50x50 "01234567" blue font [size: 10]

Another fun one for mazes would be writing Turtle code to solve them. Get your turtle through the maze with code. That could be *really* interesting in a number of ways. If your turtle *can't* complete a command. e.g. you said `forward 10` but there are only 8 spaces, does it hit the wall and bounce? Is it a syntax error? Do you have to write the whole program at once, or can you go step by step, then mark points in your script to branch from if you get stuck? Can you write a generic right-turning solver or is that cheating? Has anyone done anything like this?

Hi
In rebol draw I have often  used the design pattern
```
view/new layout [ bx: box 300x300 effect[ draw[  push a push b ]]]
```
and then have something change the blocks `a` and `b` and `show bx`
In red, the blocks needs to be put there explicitly so I thought something like 
```
view layout compose/deep [ bx: box 300x300 draw [ push  ( reduce [ a ] ) push (reduce [b] ) ] ]
```
would work. However, when changing `a ` or `b` and `show bx` the content does not update.  
It seem I need to change something directly in the block bx/draw for any changes would take effekt.
Therefore I believe there must be a way to force the reparsing of the draw.
How can I force the reparse of the draw block?


[14:23:15](#LRFSr8RJD-EGmufhOb5jvejin-QmVzbxZ5WzIBPZKgs) <henrikmk (Henrik Mikael Kristensen)>:
@ingvast Red doesn't bind draw blocks, while REBOL does. This is really a limitation, unfortunately. AFAIK, you will have to re-assign the draw block in order to have it reparsed, or poke new values directly into the block.

I agree that it is unfortunate that one cannot include variables into draw, but can understand it can slow it down considerably. So I have some understanding for the design choice.

> I agree that it is unfortunate that one cannot include variables into draw, but can understand it can slow it down considerably. So I have some understanding for the design choice. 

It should not cause slowdowns, since the parser should convert the draw dialect into draw instructions once. When that is done, values should be directly accessible for the draw engine, and the user should be able to change those values without having to reparse anything. In Red, this parsing is constantly done on the fly, building draw instructions, one instruction at a time. This is really slow.

In REBOL, AFAIK, the block is only parsed, when needed. REBOL draw is fairly quick, if you treat a draw block as a fixed structure with bound values. It also allows draw blocks of much, much greater complexity, since you can bind thousands of values in a draw block to values in another block.

However, neither of them posses a controllable draw queue, and if they had that, draw would be even faster, since things could truly be drawn at Red/System or C speeds.

[15:49:22](#mh9tgqWBJSB8BTKfIjL5YiT8YE1VQddzPyKQaxNI8r0) <hiiamboris (NOT THIS ONE)>:
"controllable draw queue" what's that and how can it speed draw up?

[16:15:46](#iQYlyKq6YZjmmkTPpIw5Pei7DsG4l4EZ3ouTglTvPgU) <henrikmk (Henrik Mikael Kristensen)>:
The draw engine should focus on simply traversing a list of draw instructions as quickly as possible with pointers to coordinates and color values. Shapes are more constant. That's the draw queue. If you change a single value (red box instead of blue), you simply execute the draw queue again. Having multiple draw queues allows instancing and generating primitives.

If you look at the tenth field, a one indicates that the object is affected by the gravity function, that large number of objects slows the main cicle, but I decided to shorten the guards number instead of deleting gold bags. í ½í¸

There is also the gold question. The collected bags are deleted from the face tree, so the gravity loop is shorter and faster along the game, it may seem an issue but is not. That allows the guards to go smarter because they know the gold is vanishing. í ½í¸†

(The complication comes before simplification. When you learn something new you create many interconnected hypothesis, then you cut then you start a process which cuts the wrong ones and the right ones emerges, and I like doing this í ½í¸‰

If an actor is function and `face` is its argument, that `face` word will be bound only to that function. So If I bind code at `on-creation` it will bound to the actor context and another actor will be unable to see it! The resulting is that I can't create an object with a `face` word in its code, as it would be bound to an unavailable context. My object's functions body would need continuous rebinding to be shared from all actors. The only solution is to structure the code as a function with `face` as argument and not as function with no arguments and the `face` bound at creation.

I have done the same, until the last 6 months I have felt the needing to express the same thing in different ways. It has been like being at nursery and then at primary school. Differently from other languages, Redbol ones have a huge number of combinations for doing the same thing. While in others, strong rails trace your coding round, Redbol let you be free to develop your own style. 
This comes with a price and risk of spreading the data and functions over multiple places, losing control and knowledge of it. After this phase, you usually start writing a new one concentrating the information and restructuring the old one, or you die!

Reading more docs, it seems to be possible. Highere level DSL might not be fully defined yet. @hiiamboris  So far, I am kind of versed on a naming convention. E.g. code like for `button`beginning with `function [btn]`, `define-handlers`should be just `handlers`.

I do remember, when Carl was working on his R3 VID version. Most of the time was spent on its design, purity, smoothness. Maybe @henrikmk will not agree the design was sufficient, as Saphirion's version removed reactors IIRC, but really - the disign of styles, actors, reactors, needs to be mostly a declarative structure. 

I don't even want to see some object hierarchy being exposed to the TLD (top level dialect, if possible).  IIRc `options`defined, what parameters can be used for TLD , `faced`kept instance level facet modifications, all actors could be used in TLD too.

I also loved (in comparison to VID2) the ability to set/get facets via e.g. `get-facet face 'size` or `do-style face 'on-click true`

Not sure how flexible the GUI was, but Carl tried to aproach it with the following point of view - users have to love to use it. Please let's keep some of those principles in mind http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/gui/gui.html

It's normal as you are using the CLI console. There is no default event loop running in the CLI console. `view/no-wait` cannot process any event, that's why it doesn't work. Please use the gui-console in this case.

So fun! NormForm is a nice find. And I can see puzzle games coming out of this. Generate tiles, keep their order, then randomize and players recreate them. Not a new idea by any means. Very likely someone has already done it with NormForm. This kind of thing will also be great, muted, for backgrounds.

@greggirwin Yes, I also find their tiles useful for tiled backgrounds - that's why I tried to recreate on of them. What's interesting is how does  their software work, and more specific, what's the interface? I found (by experimenting)  that snub square and Cairo  patterns (which are duals of each other) are separated by just one argument value. How we can communicate this to designers? They say their tool is grid-based. Looking at the examples, they are only using square grid. What about the other (semi)regular tilings?

That's the interesting question for me too, but from the perspective of how a subset of network graphs could be tesselated, how to know which can't be, identifying those mappings (as there may be more than one for a given tesselation), and what benefits this kind of visualization provides. For example, do we find that things which *can be* tesselated aligns with ease of understanding or efficiency? And what about sub-tesselations that might give us the lattice, or layers of spaces Gelernter talks about in Mirror Worlds?

Ah, I hadn't thought about it. Perhaps the game will be more enjoyable, I think I'm going to try a scene where the boy vanishes when passing through the teleporter. It's a good note Gregg, THX!

I found transitions are complex to code, depending on where you place them, they produce unwanted effects, even slowing down the game, because you don't control when View does the screen refresh and in the meantime some movements occur on the screen. So I have managed to make the flash effect as a transition between screens, but only for the boy. For guards, it causes the game to pause for an instant when a guard crosses the teleporter, which is not feasible while playing. Also from this release the game saves the progress made and each time it starts at the last level reached.

Certainly tricky. You'll notice a lot of UIs become non-responsive when changing screens. e.g. books that turn pages. In some virtual worlds, some render continuously no matter what, so every surface can respond to events, even if it's a rotating cube or you're flying over a landscape. This kind of transition, where you go from one world to another effectively, has no continuity which means there's a point where events *have to* be directed to one or the other, so you you either don't accept events for a period of time, or you risk them going to the wrong target if the UI doesn't make it clear.

In a non-UI context, this also applies to distributed systems. An event may travel through servers and brokers to reach a receiver, but that receiver may not be there anymore when it arrives or, depending on how addressing is done, a different receiver may get it.

I think I'm ready to share with you guys a working application of my Tesselations project - [TruTiles](github.com/GalenIvanov/Graphics-Red/blob/master/TruTiles.red). It's a program that generates patterns. Every pattern starts as one of the 3 regular or another 6 semiregular tesselations of the plane. Then I apply to each tile a combination of rules that define what is rendered.

@GalenIvanov WOW! WOW! WOW! TilesAsAService will be our next product. :^)

Thoughts:
- Show something while it's rendering, so the user knows it's working hard on their behalf.
- If the default tile is the grid, put it first (top) in the list of tiles.
- The shadow feature is *very* cool, but (Windows' fault) the toggle button looks like a command button. Maybe make it a check box?
- Add a feature to save settings as well as PNGs. Make it *really* easy, maybe even with a list of them available, to easily load them again.
- This is absolutely *wild*.

Right now, I have no hope of predicting what a pattern will look like, or where changes kick in that break shapes, etc. It's fun, but also makes me want a TruchetTurtle, where I can watch it walk around to generate a pattern, maybe highlighting tiles or rules as they are applied to its current state. I don't know if that's remotely possible, as I haven't looked at the engine, but I think a number of us here like Logo and L-Systems for those reasons; seeing how a pattern emerges, and how we interpret it, like cloud-gazing.

There's an interesting aspect to the direct selection approach for pairs, aligned with @toomasv's recent report on shape clipping. By providing a shape in a direct selector like this you automatically constrain the possible values a user can select, which would be very hard to do beyond simple shapes.

I don't know what SVG or other vector formats support, but since `draw` allows us to specify raster image elements, we can do this easily. This is just brainstorming, but we should be able to have a standalone "format" which is a combination of embedded raster image data, vector commands, and a `draw` spec which generates a complete image.

How this should work exactly, I don't know. :^) But just as Postscript required an embedded interpreter, this could be a use for libRed in other contexts. The main possibility it opens up, though, is a programmable mixed mode editor. We're not going to compete with Photoshop, but it's another example where a basic core and plugin model could work well.

And because it's all Red, not only can you do the obvious things like write fast plugins in R/S for image processing, including RedCV, (and we do still want an internal effect pipeline and a `convolve` kernel), but extensions that programmatically identify all the lines, boxes, circles, etc. and apply effects to them. Plugins to optimize raster elements. Or go one step further and think about the `animation` R&D @GalenIvanov is doing. Not only can you can vector and raster data, but code that operates on it. Not just animations, but potentially an API for each image, which may include standard code that comes from the LiveImageIDE. e.g. blur, go gray, alter transparency, parameterized badge. Now you're not including dozens of variations of each image for different states or uses, just one that can adapt as needed.

PDF is Postscript (plus compression, embedded fonts, and other features), and Postscript is Forth at its heart; also a great example of a DSL. Being a Forth descendent, Red is a great fit.

**rebgui grid prototype** Hi all. Digged something out of my old harddrives. Back at the time, I have asked Cyphre to create a better grid for the RebGUI. It was supposed to be open-source and I have paid for the development. The bad thing was, that at exactly the time of release, Ashley changed RebGUI API significantly. It was close to his abandoning of RebGUI, and hence I can't find an R2 + rebGUI release, it would work with ....

http://www.2zone.cz/pekr/rebgui-grid.zip

- It is face based, but according to doc it supported up to 10K rows before the slow-down.
- As a face based, it allowed to have anything as a cell content
- Allowed to have hilited row or a cell
- Supported keyboard navigation
- Supported programatic navigation
- Last but not least - virtual data system. The idea was to work directly upon the data block you've received e.g. from a DB query. The grid created virtual column system, so even if you have swapped the columns, it just remapped to the original block and no data shuffling was needed in the original data block.

It might server as an inspiration to get similar design into Red VID. Even if it would be simpler.

@hiiamboris Looked briefly into Red Spaces  docs and the system imo needs simplification and / or abstraction. For me, it is hardly acceptable, during sty style definition, to see the stuff like `function`. User of the system or style creator, should not eventually be exposed to unnecessary internals of the language. 

On the other hand, I like flexibility and I do remember being a bit nervous about declarative nature of R3 GUI, where it met the R3 code - it used comments to describe args, and without that, I was nervous about where those arguments are coming from. 

Let me compare the descriptive nature of R3 GUI to Red Spaces:

```
clicker: [

	about: "Single-action button without text. Basis of other styles."

	facets: [
		size: 28x28
		area-color: 60.70.150
		edge-color: 96.96.96
	]

	options: [
		size: [pair!]
		area-color: [tuple!]
	]

	faced: [
		area-size: ; set by resize
		pen-color: ; set by on-draw
		area-fill: ; set by on-draw
	]

	draw: [
		pen pen-color
		line-width 1.5
		grad-pen cubic 1x1 0 40 area-fill
		box 1x1 area-size 3
	]

	actors: [
		on-draw: [
			face/facets/area-fill: make-fill face/facets/area-color face/state/mode
			color: get-facet face 'edge-color
			if face/state/mode = 'over [color: color / 2]
			face/facets/pen-color: color
			arg ; return draw block
		]

		on-click: [ ; arg: event
			face/state/mode: arg/type
			draw-face face
			if arg/type = 'up [do-face face]
			none
		]
	]
]
```

vs stuff like:

```
;--  I am not sure I want to see this stuff in a user space:

button [
	function [btn] [

;-- Why double blocks? Paths in GUI dialect (list/item) make me a bit nervous, not used to them, but let's see

list/item [[pen cyan]]

paragraph [[
	(self/font: serif-12 ())
	pen blue
]]

;-- would change following, into ..... 

define-handlers [	
	inf-scrollable: extends 'scrollable [			

handlers: [
         inf-scrollable: scrollable [
```

When ppl were working on VID 1.3 and later 2.0 for R3, there were several attempts. The general agreement though was, that styling has a different target than programmers. Any language constructs should be hidden in lower layers, if possible, not being exposed to style makers, etc.

When ppl were working on VID 1.3 and later 2.0 for R3, there were several attempts. The general agreement though was, that styling has a different target than programmers. Any language constructs should be hidden in lower layers, if possible, not being exposed to style makers, etc.

Also you must be confusing event handlers with actors. Every space supports almost the same set of actors as any View face, defined currently thru `with` only.

`handlers` are meant for widget builders, to define spaces inner logic that cannot be overridden with an actor. You take it for granted in View because you don't see what the OS and all the huge amount of R/S code in the View module are doing for you.

@planetsizecpu Couple things about cave-in, as a Linux user...

If the cave binary isn't in the root directory,  trying to open `%DATA/cave-in.jpg` will fail.
 This is the `relative path vs. absolute path`issue that I came up against when I did `Parse Caddy`. You can't know where a user is going to stick the executable.
I ended up having a include file that has a giant wall of image data, but if I remember correctly - boris made a macro 

*nix cares about capitalization for directory name, so  trying to open`%data/agent-l1.png`, or anything in the `data` directory will fail, because the folder name is `DATA`

About the case on `%data` I'm looking at github to modify the folder to lowercase but the only option found is for delete file, as there are a lot of files I am a bit lazy to have to upload everything again on a new folder we will see, I don't promise anything í ½í¸‰

Merged, thx @gltewalt 

Some elevator holes are designed to allow the boy to cross when grab the wheelbarrow, it is a useful trick. Also note that the elevators don't carry the boy to travel when it has the wheelbarrow on hands, also intentioned, in that case, you'll see the wheelbarrow traveling across the walls. 

These days I am trying to fix a bug that occurs when the boy jumps out of the kart and grabs the handle just as the elevator passes over them, I think only occurs in levels 8 and 26, it is a collateral effect that occurs when coinciding the second event while the first is being processed for his service routine, you see the boy in the kart and also holding the handle at the same time grabbed by the kart, but I think he has a simple solution.

Yes @gltewalt  the number appears just after click on the Play button for a second then the game start. On my W10 i5 system it is a `0`. The narrow elevators are trimmed for the boy and the guards to have enough time to jump out. On platform elevators there is less time, so the guards some times will not reach the ground if interpreted, more if the system is doing some heavy task, but I haven't seen that behaviour on compiled mode. I think it is necessary to better adjust these waiting times. I will do it as soon as possible.

Iâ€™m not sure, it seems like a different problem. It stops registering click for some time, it doesnâ€™t point to a different element.

Hereâ€™s the code I tried:
```
view [t: text-list data ["a" "b" "c"] [probe face/selected] button "add" [append t/data "d"]]
```

The `add` button is probably not needed as I can get the same behaviour when clicking on "a" without adding other elements. It doesnâ€™t happen when clicking on "b" or "c". So itâ€™s probably unrelated.

@lylgithub2021 Just count your opening and closing brackets and, by that, realize that you're `wait`ing outside of the loop. For now, you're changing from empty text to "input changed" message and  vice versa six times in a row in an instant. Only after that you're `wait`ing only once for 0.5sec.

In the web world, there is a lot of emphasis on responsive UI design. The UI needs to adapt to the size, layout and orientation of the device viewing the page. How would something similar be applied to Red GUI apps? Having fixed sizes for faces wouldn't work very well, especially one intends to have their app be used across multiple devices with the same code. In the web world we can scan media size and use different sizes for UI elements, or change the flow or layout accordingly. Likewise if changing the orientation of the device from portrait to landscape. What approaches could be used with Red View to achieve responsive UI design?

Lots of "old news" there for some (I designed a log spiral that was etched into the floor at my old house), but a few tidbits I didn't know. While https://grtcalculator.com/ doesn't seem to work right now, could we use that idea for smarter layouts, and tools that suggest settings? But what struck me as not-too-hard, useful, and fun for the graphically oriented, is the image cropping idea.

Interesting how you workaround the lack of sound @ldci so you call sox `play ...` on each beep. 

The main idea I have at this moment is to create a Vid object that will have `rate n`, but not
visible on screen, so game funcs will manipulate some freq or note field on this object, depending 
on how sound works, to play some effect sound or note. But there will be a global sound effects switch
as in all the computer games, if it is ON then `n` rate parameter will be set to some fixed value so 
the sound func will run with the object parameters, but if switch is OFF then `n` rate parameter will 
be none so will not play sound effects although the funcs will manipulate the object. So the sound 
will play asynchronous and not delaying the gameplay.

For background music is the same idea with a different Vid object, the question is that I don't like
to set a sound file, I better prefer to code some notes because the melody [Turkey In The Straw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr8QnkTwT_w)
is simple, say `melody1: "AEBCDFCDGEACDEBC" melody2: "BCDEAFCGAEBCFED"` so on each `rate` tick will 
consume a note.

I don't know at this moment how will come sound, is just my idea by now, one key question is if sound
will be available on console, to test notes, so we can compose any melody much more easy, if not then
will have to make some sound mockup script to test sound alone.

@chunes3 how I often start is by writing the VID code manually first, just a small bit, so I can see what I want the data to look like that I'm going to generate. Then build the pieces to generate one item. e.g. the set-word (name), style, and facets. With that,  you're pretty much done and just have to assemble the parts and drive it from other data.

[19:44:58](#ILGtnYii4S6HEwEDy9zFcMxssPmg-XHAXYq-N-1oFeY) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
Also, generate your data and compare it to the manual version you wrote. Preview that before feeding it to VID and you'll learn a lot.

@GalenIvanov Would like to ask something towards the animation dialect. I can see the following pattern, where `expires`looks kind of repetitive / busy:

```
start 1 duration 2 ease :ease-in-out-quad
    stroke-path test (path) width 15 color (papaya - 10.10.10) expires after 4
```
Could the expiration instruction be moved to the first line? Or is that this way, because you can have multiple strokes as shown on the second like, each with its own expiration timeout? Does the first line mean, that what follws (is indented) is a group of multiple instructions?

@pekr Thank you for your question! I'll upload the documentation in the weekend (or at latest on Monday). 
`expires` works only with "compound" effects - `particles`, 'text-fx', `curve-fx', `stroke-path` and that's why I decided to declare it at the effect level and not at `start`. `start` works like `pen` and similar - changes the state until the next `start`. There might be many effects after `start` and each can be delayed by some time, if there was `delay` keyword.  That's why I decided to set expiration time for each compound effect.

Were you thinking about grouping stuff? I would not hesitate using blocks .... for things like slides, multiple strokes, etc. Because even in Powerpoint, which I am using for animations for our LED screen, you set delays, expiration, repetition for the slide itself, as well as for its selected elements, separately.

I'd say, there's an unnoticed self delusion in this case, different for everyone. For example, if one loves to dance one can dance for oneself, and get recognized like [Marquest Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBqb3mkmQ7Q). Maybe you won't get as popular but you'll have enough, and a lot of fun. Or one can join some govt-sponsored club of good for nothing shadows that live and breathe boredom and only get invited by organizations to provide background for some official events. In the latter case one actually abandoned his dream by refusing responsibility for it and only pretends to follow it.

@GalenIvanov Would like to ask about the duration of animations. Is there any possibility to accelerate / slow-down? I can see, there is `on-time` event, so one could probably use that section to program that. Just curious though. In vide editing software, we've got key-frames, so that you can divide the path to multiple points and set various parameters to such a node and between nodes use diferent metrics of acceleration, slow down, etc. Maybe  @Oldes could share some ideas from his Flash experience :-)

I'm okay for using an object for now, but @greggirwin any news on range! datatype?

There's also use case for half-open pairs, e.g. smth like `100xNONE .. 200x200` (impose no lower limit on Y). But just mentioning it as food for thought right now. If pairs were floating point we could leverage NaN for that. `100xNAN`, `100x-INF`...

For ranges, we could start without literal form. Mold it as `make range! [a b]`. And make `..` a non sticky constructor operator. `a..b` - not a word anymore.

@hiiamboris agreed on the parenthetical form issue. I don't know how Nenad intends to address those issues, but we should note them.

I also agree we can start `range` work without a literal form. As appealing as `..` is from a familiarity standpoint, making it not a word is an exception I'm not sure I like. It seems like it would be too easy to trip over, but it's also not the only one.

I will have to play to see, but am working on many fronts at the moment. For GUI editors, the first thing I thought of was selecting a face and showing sizing handles. That leads to being able to select multiple faces and how to be smart about sizing. e.g. sizing a face in the upper left *might* automatically adjust other faces offsets that it overlaps. Maybe it does that by default, but holding ctrl while dragging overrides it.

Other things I really want in everything is standard undo/redo capability. In the case of UIs, it would also be great to copy the entire layout to do what-if comparisons without having to copy files on disk, load multiple projects, etc. This starts moving into the realm of responsive design, or what Atronix called Semantic Zoom, and automatic resizing. That's much bigger, so a simple manual option is where to start.

It is relatively little size single draw, using clipping for cells boundering - so no arbitrary faces. For that you should use @hiiamboris `spaces`. But it can show arbitrary images and draw in cells, i.e. anything that `draw` can show. This needs more works though.

About last question - not my call. And my guess is no. Also, I can't test on other platforms. It is developed on W10, but as I have not used system code, it possible in principle that it compiles on other platforms too. Not too optimistic about that, though.

I just need to have the first/last or the central row  positioned at given index at opening (one of them, I actually prefer the central one); and also have the  corresponding position returned or accessible when closing the table. It is need for reaopening and bookmarking.

@GiuseppeChillemi Can you please explain with some example, what do you mean by "accessing data via code using an index" â˜ [April 28, 2022 9:19 AM](https://gitter.im/red/red/gui-branch?at=626a3206cd938f6ea21f3370) There are principally three ways to specify address of data: COLxROW in original table, COLxROW in current index (may be sorted and filtered), and COLxROW in current visible view.

Accessing data = reading or writing data in any of the VIEWS you have mentioned, where you express which data you want to access using the "views" you have mentioned. 

face/data  (Index is from head)
face/filtered (Index is from head of filtered data)
face/visible (index is from the head of visible data)
face/source (Index  in the original data)

`select-row face/filtered idx`

`DATA/:IDX/(index? find column-list column-name)` (if block of blocks with columns on the first line)

Thanks all for testing, and for the feedback! And to @toomasv for pressing forward on this daunting task. We know there will be differences with @hiiamboris' `spaces`, and we still have a `table!` module on our list, which is a background "type" that should work with the GUI styles.

The editing aspects and other extension hooks will be key, long term. @toomasv is laying a foundation to build on, with the two key domains of data and spreadsheets. The next level beyond that will either be through extensions/hooks, or require Boris' `spaces`. These will both be game-changing for what people can do with Red.

I have looked at the code and I have found `save-table-as` and similar functions but no corresponding menu entry. I imagine it is intended. 
Also about saving and loading, other than to file, it is important to save to a `word` the current table state and load the table from it. This is useful to store the data into a database ROW and restore it from another session opened elsewhere. 
The implementation to save it as file is a great idea. So you can load the table OFFLINE, share it and write back from another session. Please consider having an `EXTRA` section so we/you can add useful data to it like `original-source`

> which is the difference between REMOVE and DELETE?

REMOVE removes given column from column-index, so it is not shown. All removed columns are restored with RESTORE.
DELETE deletes column from original data, Deleted columns can be restored only by reopening the file (unless you have saved it with column deleted).
HIDE sets column width to 0. It is still in view and can be copied, just not seen. UNHIDE sets width of all hidden columns to default size.

Sounds like our problem is solved, once `spaces` is ready. :^) Though `spaces` has a lot more, and if the rest of your UI is native, there *may* be cases where someone wants a single, drop-in style for that.

Many UIs are simple, but there's still the issue that desktop OSs aren't designed to have their controls/faces repeatedly created and destroyed at speed. You can do it of course, and there's no *technical* reason it shouldn't work, but a pure `spaces` approach would be much better. I don't know how mobile OSs or langs implement them, but it's a dominant model there, so anyone looking at it should research there.

And the old grid styles that allowed things beyond text weren't completely extensible in that regard. You had just a few options, like those @GiuseppeChillemi mentioned. Check boxes and images being key.

How it worked, historically, in something like Excel is that it's all drawn, like @toomasv and @hiiamboris are doing. So there is no real checkbox. Just a drawn box and code that knows clicking on that cell should change its state to draw with a pattern-filled box.

As Boris notes, you can also do this at small scales, even without a real scrolling panel or doing more than changing faces visibility. You just create them and change the data. No, you don't get that nice feedback of seeing things move incrementally (which they don't in all UIs anyway), and it's a pain to work with so needs helpers, but it can be done.

What some other systems do is like old line editors. All the data is display only, but then you can activate a line/row for editing interaction. Sometimes this happens transparently, as in Excel (cell by cell). The problem with using native controls is that faking it then means emulating the look of a button for each OS, which ends up being a huge pain. But @toomasv has already shown that logic fields work, and a "button" could work the same, very simply as a demo, but once again you run into all the extra handling, tracking a pressed state look when mousing away, etc.

Browsing thru a table with 10â€˜000 rows rarely isnâ€˜t something a user wants to do. ODBC allows for paging, offering oppotunities to further improve responsiveness.

@hiiamboris  I have never said the opposite. For big mixed data, unfiltered data is a mess but paged access is important because during filtering you may query too much data and performance will suffer with very long list freezing.

DB thinks as query on table. On most ERPs, on the interface you have a "filter on/off" switch. The problem is on the "OFF" phase: without paging, you would load 100.000 rows.

@9214 asks the key question in that NaN sorting ticket.

> How other languages handle that, BTW?

If NaNs are technically floats, and we support them as a value, `sort` should *never* crash because they exist. That's step 1. Step 2 is whether they produce nonsensical sorted results for NaNs themselves. That's bad, but not our fault (again, technically). But given that it affects how other values sort, it's bugged.
```
>> sort [3 2 1 0   1.#NaN  -1 -2 -3  1.#INF -1.#INF]
== [-1.#INF -3 -2 -1 1.#NaN 0 1 2 3 1.#INF]
>> sort [3 2 1 0 -1 -2 -3  1.#INF -1.#INF  1.#NaN]
== [1.#NaN 2 1 0 -1 -2 -3 1.#INF -1.#INF 3]
```
We *should* do the most helpful thing for the user, and that means keeping them together. If we choose not to do this, we have to clearly doc the issue. I'm OK with noting that custom sorting needs to be NaN-aware, but we should provide templates for people to copy.

D has put a lot of thought into NaN handling. For example there are operators `!< !<= !> !>=` (negations of comparison - made especially for NaNs). Our COMP_SORT comparison just needs to be NaN-aware like that.

Thanks @hiiamboris. :+1:  Red normalizes NaNs, but I recall using them inline caused issues at one point. @qtxie please give your thoughts on the NaN approach D uses. I don't think we want special ops for them, just transparent handling. When we have our own decimal type, it will matter even less.

On paging, from the recent chat here, I agree that better querying and filtering is the most effective place to invest time and effort. But I'm also a stupid human who sometimes forgets to use `everything` to find files, and that's OK. There are times where the act of looking for what I want leads to other discoveries. Personally, that's where paging falls down for me. Seeing tiny chunks of data doesn't *really* let me browse. At the extremes browsing doesn't work well either, but there's a huge gray middle-ground between 100 and 1M items. I always thought fisheye menus were cool for browsing, but they also fail at scale because you can't control the mouse movement in fine enough increments. That could lead to a new, hierarchical or spatial browsing model of some kind I imagine.

Say your scroller is actually a 2D box. At the far left you scroll like a regular scroller. But the more data you have the wider it gets, and as you also move the thumb to the right, it slows the vertical scrolling. Of course, it could be horrible in actual use. :^)

As for the `with`, it stems down to VID, where you can kind of inline other configuration directly to the underlying object using a `with`keyword. During R2/R3 times, I think I have seen `options` used, can't remember which GUI version used that though.

Thanks @toomasv. Sometimes I can't find things right in front of me. 

I like `config`, as `layout` is already taken. :^) No on `setup`.

Are there other places where `options` is used directly in VID? There is some overlap, as we can have new facets, but also group them, like `extra` overlaps this need. And all generic words. My thought about `with` comes from seeing that, and in the context of VID where it has nice meaning. I'm not set either way, and it's a bit late here, so I won't think more until my brain is fresh.

If config is a facet that lives with the widget, `with` is the most *direct* way to work with it, and it will be easier to access if one wants. If it's just data that gets read and discarded then `options` wins because it doesn't require you to allocate a facet for it. Or if you think this data is not going to be accessed by anyone, thus you kind of hide it. What seems extra then is `options [config:`, why can't it be just `options`?

Thanks for explanation, @hiiamboris ! I agree with all points except last, because `options` is used primarily for some predefined things not set by my template, e.g. in case of table: `[style: table vid-align: top at-offset: none]`. `config` is added to these once on initialisation, so it preferred to be kept in `options`. I'll consider making it mutable during execution, in which case it will be transferred to separate facet.

`mark-active`, but it currently takes only relative coordinates of cell as visible  on screen. I still have to make a more general function for selection.

I don't think that's a silly example at all @toomasv. It shows exactly how it works, and very clearly. Very nice!

[18:03:53](#mWEcfhu6IbgxuQEgCgh5gVDGCbR8gqEmeoW_GNmVGxw) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
On formatting, we definitely want to use `format`, rather than duplicating effort and having multiple systems. This work will push that back on the priority list. @toomasv new example also brings to mind that HOFs should be applicable to selected data, which may be defined as above or via cell ranges. So HOFs come back up as well.

Coloring isn't part of `format`, but there is overlap in how things work, including how a `table!` type works and maps to UIs as simply as possible.  I haven't looked at the internals of `table` to see how data structures map architecturally. Future work.

One of the key aspects for formatting (including coloring) is the hierarchy (scoping) of application and how to make it efficient. Another aspect, which comes down to design choices, as none are perfect, is masked inputs for editing. AFAIK there is no "winner" in this area from UX research. I'd love to be wrong about that. For now, we need to keep it simple. I don't remember if @hiiamboris has experiments in this area.

+1 To adopt Format
For me, conditional visualization is just color names or tuples returned by a function you pass the current cell value . Colors could be  either for text and backgrounds.  Later, this function could return other font attributes.

Thanks, @greggirwin ! Yes, I like it myself too :)= 
The thing is, `copy-selected` generates two global words - `selected-data`, refering to you-know-what, and `selected-range`, refering to addresses of cells from which data were extracted. Data are extracted exactly in order you selected cells. After `copy-seleccted` you can select either single cell or new range, which has to have same length as data previously selected (may be I'll loose this requirement). With `paste-selected`, if single cell is selected then previously extracted data are pasted into table according to the figure in `selected-range` but relative to the given cell. If a range is selected (matching the size of extracted data), then data (possibly edited) are pasted into the selected range, again exactly in order as the (new) range is selected. :hmm: Hopefully this makes some sense...

@toomasv that's *great*. By making it data driven and declarative (it could be, done in code). It's powerful because then you can create "forms" or entry points into a spreadsheet, insert data, it recalcs, and you can extract data from "result" ranges.

@toomasv can you put the test DB in the repo, or somewhere else if it's large?

Thanks, @greggirwin ! Yes, I saved layout configurations in %chinook2.cnf (in repo). To use these one can just do `table-opts: load %cchinook2.cnf` before opening `%chinook2.red`. I'm going to put it in menu though. 

Test db is a [standard SQLite sample db](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/).

@GiuseppeChillemi Yes with 2 draw methods depending on face data value (0 or 1). The basic idea is to use an object with properties and methods in the face/extra property.

You imo either need to create a transpiller, which generates the whole app in terms of the html, css, js ... not just VID, but also if you want your app to be any useful - it has to have some supporting code in js.  Or ... use stuff like Webassembly to put whole your app in a container. But I am not even sure I have ever seen WebAssembly app - not sure if this concept lives up to its initial expectations ....

It does become more involved when you have to create interim structures and work on subsets of data, though it can still be pretty fast, and then you're just assembling what table works against in memory. That still has its limits, unless you then stream results to disk (cached query result) and then chunk against that.

@GiuseppeChillemi From a quick glimpse, it's not possible with the `prev-chunk`, `next-chunk` actors, because they seem to be a bit opinionated on how to retrieve the prev/next chunk and implement the retrieval by themself instead of executing configured handlers. But I'm really not judging or questioning the design here, I'd rather wait for more docs to see what is possible.

> `menu` option should be configureable directly in VID via `menu [ ... ]`

Agreed. In spaces that's how it works.

> should be possible to directly inline expressions/values in VID rules without `compose`, using parens or something similar

Also how it works in Spaces. This is tricky though, as requires a trigger, like `data`. VID can only extend the set of triggers, but it can't magically know if next token is a keyword or expression, so this notion is limited.

> ability to refer to the current window at all times

You have it: `view window: layout [button "Show me" [? window]]`

> there should be an option to make a widget (reactively) fit the bounds of its parent, so when the parent is resized, it is also resized

What I aim to achieve in Spaces is that resizing should always work automatically out of the box with zero effort. Kludge for VID: https://gitlab.com/hiiamboris/red-elastic-ui

> ability to set minimum/maximum size for windows/widgets

Agreed. I also introduced this. But this can only be a part of the resizing system.

> "message box" widget, or helper widget

Could be useful, just nobody designed it. VID makes it easy for anyone anyway.

> color picker widget (unless this can't be done natively?)

I think @toomasv has one. 

> "grid"-based positioning system

VID has it: `view compose/only [panel 3 (probe map-each x "ABC" [map-each y 3 [reduce ['text rejoin [x y]]]])]`
![](https://i.gyazo.com/ef54caaddd4014cd19090b6890f0598f.png)

Spaces have an infinite more powerful grid. I don't think native VID ever will though, as there's no such OS widget.

> Alt-shortcuts and keyboard shorcuts should be configurable for menu options

And they should be right in the menu block! But this needs design. E.g. how to denote shortcuts (datatype, DSL), and where to insert the keyboard hook.

> should be able to configure a menu option as disabled

Agreed.

> menu options should allow for inline code (rather than just an ID)

Discussed this in /help.

> ability to have a button selected/highlighted by default

You have it: https://w.red-lang.org/en/vid/#focus

> filtering input should be possible (using Parse and/or charsets, or something similar)

Agreed, but again needs design and ties with the (missing so far) part of the formatting work - input validation. It's tougher than it seems at first. But for simple cases you can abuse `on-key`.

> escape key should deselect all text

I think it's up to OS, not us. ESC is a nonstandard behavior.

> should be able to manually send special events like undo/redo, copy/paste, etc

Agreed. In Spaces I added an `edit` DSL that has commands like `undo` and `redo`.

> should also be possible to override them

Here I'd like you to elaborate the use case.

> (text widgets) should support rich text at some point, somehow

Spaces will have this eventually, but I'm not there yet. I don't think there's a native control for it. Do you have an example code in Tk that proves me wrong? I can't make much sense of the info by the link you mentioned.

> should be able to change cursor position

Yes. Very annoying limitation.

> should be able to customize cursor

Disagree here. You only do this in fully featured editors, not in input fields.

> revisit Ctrl+(key) events, as `Ctrl+S` registers the key as #"^S" rather than #"s" or #"S" (with ctrl?: true)

It's `#"^S"` in `on-key` but `#"s" + ctrl?` in `on-key-down/up`. This is how OSes work. Not our doing. `on-key` gives you a composed character, not the key itself.

> some keys like delete and escape should also return `word!`s rather than #"^H" and #"^["

Agreed.

> setting the value of a widget should be reactive. for example, `my-area/text: ""` does not replace the text of the widget

You must have a bug somewhere. Show the minimal code.

We've talked in the past about R2's `list` style, which was great but had some limitations. @toomasv has a working and quite advanced `table` style now, and @GalenIvanov is going to coordinate with him and R&D a `tree` style. I think there's still value in `list`, which offers rich layout for "rows", and an associated style would be an `accordian`, that is, sections that expand and collapse, like a tree, but with richer content/sub-layouts. Not sure where a code-folding editor falls in this, but that's basically a data tree. @henrikmk and @rgchris have both done some great UI style work in the past, so I hope we can get some good thoughts and momentum going in this area.

I've recently taken to building a few applications in pure R2 VID, where I'm using LIST heavily. One note is that the SUPPLY method automatically makes it easy to window quickly through infinitely sized lists. I don't have to consider updating the list at all, and I use a picker function inside SUPPLY to get the data needed and a render function to render the cell output correctly. The iterated face method drives the rendering fully. Where LIST is weak is handling multi-selection.

AltMe surely used something like `list` and faces internally. We can scale up as we R&D. Start with fixed height rows, then let heights vary, and see how it might all be done with `draw`, like Toomas' `table`. Lots of playing we can do quickly. A key aspect is that editing doesn't have to happen in the list. An edit window comes up for that. It does need some interaction though.

```

		i2: to-image field-img
		canvas/draw/1: 'image

		canvas/draw/4: i1/size

```
I was able to implement it [here](http://www.rebol.org/view-script.r?script=vid1r3.r3) at line 1034 so should be doable. If you are interested in a more "automatic" but not working version let me know.

Put `on-up` before `below`. It is window's actor. Idea is to use actors of table's wrapper element, i.e. window in this case. If there are more elements in layout, then you have to wrap table into panel and use panel's actors. Actors of table itself cannot be used as they are already defined. (In principle they can be twisted by user to accommodate his needs of course.)

* multi-step binding
* face naming and searching 
* operating with faces near your
* double linking

* stacking using append

For example, in a DB stored procedure, you can enforce constraints, but how do you do that on a role-based system, and give the user quicker feedback? User Bob can set `max-agents` to `200` at most, but Admin Alice can set it to `5'000`. If those rules come down and the UI is built from them, based on who is getting the content, it can also build in a message telling Bob to contact Alice if he needs more agents. Can you do this with an error result from the DB, maybe, but if we can group things together, we leverage context and information locality for the analyst or dev.

I took table-template apart and put it together again so that now it is easier to manipulate virtual (i.e. active) rows and columns. As you remember `auto-index` used to add a auto-indexed column to table. This changed now into `auto-col`, and it got a partner `auto-row`. `auto-col` and `auto-row` themselves have index 0, e.g.:
```
view/flags [
   on-resizing [tb/size: face/size - 20 tb/actors/resize tb] 
   tb: table 317x167 data 10x20 focus 
      options [auto-row: #[true] auto-col: #[true]]

@luce80 Slightly more advanced technique that does not clutter the global name space, and also creates a handy map to all faces you need to later refer to:

Use ON-CREATE to populate an object with your important faces, eg:

```
MIF: make object! [start-button: none text-fields: copy []]   ;; My Important Faces
view/no-wait [
    button "Start" ON-CREATE [mif/start-button: face] [print "started"]
    text  "Text 1" ON-CREATE [append mif/text-fields face]
    text  "Text 2"  ;; not an important face
    text  "Text 3" ON-CREATE [append mif/text-fields face]
    button "Also start" [mif/start-button/actors/on-click mif/start-button none]

There is a `ï¿½` char (U+FFFD) in unicode, which "Replaces an invalid or unrecognizable character. Indicates a Unicode error."

Yes, I know. But `codepage.red` is written to explicitly return `#"^@"` in case of an unrecognized char. And that is what happend here, so by definition not a bug. The bug was in converting with the wrong codepage. That's what I was pointing out.

Position keeping is on of the most important aspects of a GUI System. When moving from the main window to a child one, and the back, you expect to find text/icons/lists/the cursor where you have left it. Changing their position, confuses the brain as it has to reseek for elements as it looses track of them or has to reposition everything as before. When you open an editor, it is fantastic to find the cursor where you have made the last edit; when you delete a line in a list, it is a breeze when you to not have to reseek for the deletion  position; when you reopen a program, having the same windows and document is very helpful. This because the most of the time, you continue working on something than doing something new. (Obviously, there are exception to this rule)

I think I have found a workaround. I have a "private" `object!` in my custom "public" style and in `init` I use `options` as a template for that object. Let's see if it works.

My plan was: when I am about to be redrawn (with `show`) do some calculations based on data taken from "linked" face. Reactivity is much harder for me. I tried to keep the size of a face in sync with that of one that is resized during window resizing but it worked only using simple VID `react` (so I had to name faces and do it in "normal" VID code) but I was not able to define it in my own custom style, how can I do it ?

Yes, you talk as if it is a simple thing and I perfectly know what you are talking about. Reactivity is hard for me. I read the docs and tried a few things but nothing worked.

The `face!` event handlers are [using a bitmask](https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/modules/view/view.red#L205) to indicate which object word has changed. As the mask is stored in an integer, it's 32-bit only, so only 32 words can be tracked. Currently 25 words are used in `face!`, so only 7 more can be added with tracking enabled.

It is already working as it is. See @toomasv table-style. In fact I have "reverse-engineered" it and I have a working version as you can see from the example above. The only thing left that will make it "complete" is the possibility to hide it. I found this `scrollable` magic only a few days ago mentioned by @hiiamboris  and tried it. A few days before I was just tring the "manual" version using the "normal" `scroller` but that was harder than expected. It seems I am compelled to use reactions but they are a bit hard for me. I nevertheless managed to have a working version but when I tried to go on with that other problems came up so when I heared of `scrollable` I tried it hoping it was easier.

Some parens are evaluated. e.g. `view [button "Extra! Extra!" [print mold face/extra] extra (1 + 2  + 3)]`

This request comes up from time to time, and may seem obvious to do. But then we have to ask how much it helps, or if you're better off building your dynamic layouts another way. The simple cases, like caption/text replacement, still need a way to refer to the config'd text, which works today.
```
s: "Extra! Extra!"
view [button s [print mold face/extra] extra (1 + 2  + 3)]

But not if your word is in an object, because paths don't evaluate automatically like words there.

@GiuseppeChillemi Yes, there is, but you have to be pretty specific about where to put it. 

> Draw it at the bottom of this button

You have several options to do this. May-be closest to your example:
```
view [
    p: panel 300x150 [
        x: button "hello" [
			append p/pane layout/only compose [
				at (as-pair x/offset/x x/offset/y + x/size/y + 10)
				button "world" with [
				][probe reduce [x/offset face/offset]]
]]]]
```
Or
```
view [
    p: panel 300x150 [
        x: button "hello" [
			append p/pane make-face/offset/spec 'button 
				as-pair x/offset/x x/offset/y + x/size/y + 10 [
					"world" [probe reduce [x/offset face/offset]]
				]
]]]
```
This is if you wanted to add it below. Try positioning it across.

> add this button to the panel and recalculate and reposition everything

I assume you mean inserting here. Again, you have to do calculations, if you are not going to feed the whole layout to `layout` again. E.g.
```
view [
    p: panel 300x150 [
        x: button "hello" [
			insert p/pane make-face/offset/spec 'button x/offset [
				"world" [probe reduce [x/offset face/offset]]
			]
			x/offset/y: face/offset/y + face/size/y + 10

How is that possible? For example, you have set the /size facet to 200x200, then you set the /text facet. How does Red know if you want to reset /size according to the /text or not?

However, it is far easier to bind a dynamic block to a temporary context, with all the structures and values, than: 
```
make make object! compose/deep/only...
```
 
Also, when you `compose/deep/only` a block, and inside of it and you create from an object proto which has also `make make object! compose/deep/only...`,  your brain  become nuts going back and forth inside the script trying to read all the structures.

I have a table and when I click on it, a group of buttons should be drawn on the right side of the table, together with an input field. The VID block is built from a function that returns it. Then, once visualized, you select a table row and the buttons and the field are drawn. The number of buttons depends on a query, the more results, the more the buttons. After the user clicks on one, the number that is inserted in the field is recalculated depending on a factor (different for each one) and written back to the table...
As it is a dynamically built block, each configuration is a word whose value is passed in a context, and each button has an id built on a rule.
 I have chosen to not use a set word for each face but to rely on a face id written in face/extra and the resulting creation block for the VID panel is returned via fuction result.

I'd like to make a `style` made as a group of 2 `button`s. If I use a `panel` then I can not have an "action" block because that is "reserved", if I use a `base` I can populate its `pane` only with `base`s and not `button`s or other "widgets" . How can I solve this problem ?

One of the tricky parts I see is akin to iterated faces in R2's `list` style. you need references to sub-items, but VID doesn't support paths for that. This also aligns with data binding needs, where you may have multiple instances of a group, each bound to a different data source.

I don't think we need new syntax. e.g. the old `build/inject` alternative idea to compose gives you more control.

In R2 list, there was only ever a single "current" item being drawn. The model made it hard to implement anything but display+action-only lists. e.g. it built the sub-layout based on an index, and you could create a link/action that was fixed, based on a block of data. But if you showed multiple items (the point of a list), things like `field` or `check/radio` didn't work. It was a nice foundation, but incomplete for real world needs.

The fix is a kind of a "documentation" fix. The idea was to "intercept" the click and "dispatch" the action based on the clicked button, and/or something similar to the buttons of a scroller which can have an action block.
In the example there is only one offset which is enough if the `base` is changed with a `panel`.

 I understand your goal now @luce80. Thanks for clarifying. There are two thoughts here.

1) a reusable compound widget should encapsulate details and hide information. So the user doesn't control the individual actions of the inner buttons. This leads to complications if you want a single style to both handle numeric spinning and list-of-data selection.

2) R2 provided more control with its `words` handling in style definitions. That was important because it didn't use native controls, so everything was built using that. Red's VID doesn't have that, so you're limited in what you can expose in a compound style anyway.

Which leads back to the other solutions we're discussing.

IMHO having the possibility to create a compound widget using already implemented native controls could be a way to extend the number of available widgets in a relatively simple way.

Alternatively, /caret can include both char index and a flag whether it is located before that char or after it.

@dockimbel : @hiiamboris already explained it. I can only add 2 things: pixels are 0-based so there is a precedent; the alternative  proposed was using `/y = 0` as a kind of escaping number so 7x7 still means a single 7-th character but 7x0 means an empty selection starting after 7-th character and representing the caret position. I do not know if the 2nd alternative is easily implemented and/or simple to "understand" by the user, you choose.

Just a second thought: 7x0 could mean an empty selection starting before 7-th character so 1-based remains and we could have it before `range!` is implemented and you still could possibly change it when View is revisited.

It is always a tough call between the native gui vs non-native one :-) During the old R2 VID times (1996 or 1998 was first View 1.0 release) we have complained, that apps might get refused, as we did not have the ability to have elements like menu, context menu, reflect OS native styling.

The perceptions changed with the iPhone revolution imo. Amiga like big buttons were not a problem anymore :-) With Red, we've got native UI integration. I like the menu, buttons, find it sufficient .... till you don't want to use more sophisticated elements like Grid, for which you simply will not be able to find a cross-platform element.

The problem of past VID was also its incompletness. Carl told us, that it was just his attempt to show a way, and expected community to bring in more sophisticated GUIs on top of View. The situation was also improved later with the AGG library integrations, so Draw got much more powerfull capabilities.

The tab-panel size (if not provided) is based on its content. So, that size is only known when all the content in all tabs has been processed. At that moment, the child `base`dimensions are already set by VID, so it's too late.

[16:31:44](#fKraohSammqm_2LQWVU0PwBfY-4x5mj3r3OXnJEX_ZQ) <dockimbel>:
So the `base` face needs to update its size after its parent panel has been redimensioned by the tab-panel. This can be easily achieved using a reactive formula:

@hiiamboris I noted (rather than reported) a similar OS hang when resizing Red windows by hand. At the time, I simply lamented it as a likely Lenovo / Win 11 driver bug.

Can't find that discussion -- Gitter search is beyond me.

I can still get the failure....My workaround is not to resize on Win11. Never seen the problem on another machine.

Please take care with Red if you are LOADing more than a few thousand images.....Red has no real garbage collection for images and (being still 32-bit) can rapidly run out of memory.

- It would be nice to have a `find-window` function. It's very easy to implement and quite handy at times.
- `set-focus` does not work on `panel` which I use to make compound widgets, so I can not forward `on-focus` to a sub-face.
- Is this "intended behaviour" ?

Compound faces are important, but not portable. e.g. Windows ListView isn't available elsewhere, so we do have to roll our own. What we need to do is design a model for how they work, so we can share them.

I do not mind the OS level, a `panel` is (or not?) a `face` and a `face` should be focusable. I would use a `base` if that provided the same functionality of a `panel`.  The OS should not know what I am doing with the `face`just provide key input for whatever it is and  continue to use `window/selected`and give `on-focus` and/or keyboard events to it.

- Why are there **3** rectangles ?
- If I drag the "brick" and then resize the window the resizing is slow and with black bands but if I uncomment the transparency and try again the resizing is faster !?
- If I change `show base/parent` with `show face/parent` the brick will not move. (A reaction loop ?)
- If I remove `later` the window does not open centered on the screen anymore !?

As a reminder, you can switch View to debug mode using `system/view/debug?: yes` to get logs about events and face-related reactions. It can sometimes dump too much info, but that's a start. A possible improvement could be to have a companion GUI app where all those logs go to, for easier usage.

As @hiiamboris said, don't worry about it until you know it's a problem. Do a test (and share it here) to generate a random combination of faces, clear, rebuild and do basic profiling. Let the computer do the work. If you *know* it's going to be a large system, and find out that the easy way won't work, then you can create pools of faces and reuse them, but that's a LOT more work and a LOT more chances to make mistakes. Then you have to ask if it's better to be a little slow than to be wrong or crash.

Viewing your solution, I think a better mitigation would be to specify in the layout dialect that you want a custom font object for a specific face. In RebGUI for REBOL, simply specifying changes to the font for a face will automatically create a new font object for it.

You are mixing up two aspects. One is the Red `font!` object which are recycled by the GC. That one contributes to extra GC pressure when used in big numbers, regardless of how the app performs.

Interesting but I need to retain a key value together with the displayed data. Think about filtering and sorting the original data and you will loose the simmetry between it and the filtered and sorted one, with my proposal you simply obtain the data in one step, with this solution you must filter and sort the source data too, or you must create a connected block with these informations, I don't know how difficult it would be to implement retriving the viewable data from a column inside a block but it doesn't sound so difficult.

> I don't know how difficult it would be to implement retriving the viewable data from a column inside a block but it doesn't sound so difficult.

`text-list` is just that. All it does today is ignore any non-string values in `/data`. There is no enforcement or connection between items in `/data` and what is displayed. 

```
blk: [
	"A" ["Hello" 1 CONFIG x y "another" %file.r]
	"B" "C" "D" ["Word"  2 CONFIG x y "column" %file2.r]
	"E" ["Red"   3 CONFIG x y "here" %file3.r]
]

Lets make it very simple with a different proposal where nothing changes: `face/data` remains  the whole data block, we should just add a `column` config with the column number as follow:

```
text-list data blk column 1
``` 

The data picker would switch to block, where each text row corresponds to the same row position in the  data block;`face/selected` returns the index as always and `face/column` stores the selected column number.

From the documentation:

```
Reactors are part of the reactive programming support in View, which documentation is pending. In a nutshell, the body block can describe one or more relations between faces properties using paths. Set-path setting a face property are processed as target of the reactor (the face to update), while path accessing a face property are processed as source of the reactor (a change on a source triggers a refresh of the reactorâ€™s code).

Each VID block has an update code inside and It is triggered from the reaction which happens at `face/text` modification. The first execution of the reaction happens when the face is created. As the field starts empty and then is filled later, the update code clear the target container. Even tagging each face, I need to remove the reaction, otherwhise the empty field is stored back. The only solution I see is to remove the reaction and use `on-enter` or write the value immediately after `field data` keyword, so the update writes back the current value

I confirm, it is working flawlessy. The `on-created` writes the field so I don't need  different field creation code but just `on-created` for each one, which I could delay to a further fields fill code belonging some other face or panel like the navigation buttons one.

Because I am working on panel generators. The generator creates a panel with edit fields connected to the OBJECT words (a ROW of data with column).

Before during and after web-biased, I am graphics person. So I use ton of a software since 1988 and being able zoom in/out scale layouts, fonts etc is wired into my experience and needs.

In View no easy entry point, as View has all paddings and spacing tuned for default OS fonts. You can start experimenting with [styles](https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/vid.adoc#style) e.g. `view [style text: text font-size 20 text "abc" text "def"]` and then eventually find your way into `system/view/VID/styles` where you could override defaults.

Depends on your font. Most likely it's [TrueType](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType) or [OpenType](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType) which are vector fonts.

Note that in Elastic UI I do not (by design) scale fonts, since most of the time this is a dumb thing to do.

Two remarks about the code:

* `cos` and `sin` are the radians version of `cosine` and `sine`. The `/radians` refinement is only there for sake of compatibility with Rebol, but we should deprecate it now that we have much shorter alternatives.

* You could be building the Draw code once only, before entering `view`, then you can just poke the values that are changing. That should make the `on-time` function much shorter and easier to read.

[13:26:49](#VufJALYQyFucmxjFGnH1qu1Cq69j-lPGNRQKMmVeerw) <dockimbel>:
For example, instead of:

```
append graph/draw compose [	; add new vertical bar
	pen blue
	hist-x: line (as-pair pixel/1 0) (as-pair pixel/1 1)
]
```
you could just update the values (even directly setting the `x` or `y` components):
```
draw-code: [
	...
	pen blue
	hist-x: line 0x0 0x1
	...
]
```
then in `on-time`:

```
hist-x/2/x: hist-x/3/x: pixel/1
```

[Updated version](https://github.com/gr4xity/gravity4x/blob/main/box-muller.red) pokes random pixels directly to an image rather than adding more draw code, so performance no longer degrades with the sample size. This also let me make the window resizable, as performance doesn't degrade with larger windows. I just love I don't need to keep separate data structures for the histograms then "render" these in a separate pass--addressing and iterating the histogram draw code directly kills two birds with one stone.

I've rolled out a major Spaces update. Apart from internal changes, `list-view` - one of the first and outdated widgets - has undergone big change:
- I got rid of absolute list coordinates (coordinates are now relative to the "anchor item"), which allows to scale it without loss of performance. I've put a manual limit at 2 billion items, which should be enough for any use case (e.g. a possible chat app may have infinite timeline addressed by date! value, with a possibility to scroll by 1 billion items around that date)
- it now supports (optional) interactivity (cursor and selection), which I plan to use for drop-down lists soon

In short it just needs to fill a "window" (10 viewports long) with items. Jump to 1'000'000'000th makes it an anchor, so it fills around it. Items themselves are generated with the data picker function (and cleaned up once they are far):

I beg to differ. Designs are not always elegant, and breaking language rules is not something we should recommend.

Solutions come from a need, and sometimes you need to explore the space, rather than design too far ahead. There is also the consideration of adding value in the short term, because you have deadlines and time pressure.

If b in a/offset: b and b Is bound to a different context you don't assign a face but the value in that context. So, if you create a context for each style, and you bind the code to It, the coder must take into consideration that he must use a full path to discriminate between the word in the local context or the same in the global one or in any other context.

Looks like a change in panel/offset to a point2D! type is causing an issue. 
```
view [
    Panel1: Panel "Panel1" 250.250.250 [
        button "change panel size" on-down [
    		? panel1/offset

    		? panel1/size
    		panel1/size/y: panel1/offset/y + 50 
    	]
    ]
]    
```
Output from this is:
```
PANEL1/OFFSET is a point2D! value: (10, 10)
PANEL1/OFFSET/Y is a float! value: 10.0
PANEL1/SIZE is a pair! value: 132x45

*** Script Error: float! type is not allowed here
*** Where: either
*** Near : panel1/size/y: panel1/offset/y + 50

Is this still in development? Or is it something I should start to deal with. If so, what is the suggested way to deal with this, given that I now have 3 datatypes mixed in one line of code.

As a german, I definitly dislike the fact that it comes at the cost of banning decimal comma.

@pekr `tuple!` with it's resolution of only 8 bit per each of it 3 to 12 places are boxed values fully contained in one Red runtime cell value. The same applies to the 2 and 3 32bit-floats of `point2D!`/`point3D`, but it  wouldn't be possible for higher dimensional `point<n>D!` values to fit another float into the cell, requiring them to allocate additional buffers and making variable-dim points a series type.

1) I want to access the table element to edit it when hitting enter in the gui field. So I need the coordiantes
2) I want to access SOURCE, which is in parent GRID-VIEW spaces, to do poin #1
3) Ok, I have understood the way.

1. Suppose you have a `cell` object (maybe as `self` or whatever) and a `grid` object (not `grid-view`). Then `pick (find/same grid/frame/cells cell) -1` should return the cell XY. Note though that this is a temporary implementation detail and will change in a few months.
2. Hierarchy (you can check it with hittest or dump-tree or by running grid-test3 or 4) is `grid-view/window/grid/cell`, so if you have access to `cell` you can access `grid-view` as `cell/parent/parent/parent`. Or if you're defining event handlers you may define them for `grid-view` initially.

I don't know how you're reading. You have a certain talent for sure. It's even emphasized in bold that such "path" is a **block of object + pair tuples**. I can change "tuples" for "couples" if that makes it clearer for you.

You talk about paths, then I see this:

`[list-view 210x392 hscroll 210x8 thumb 196x8]`

I think it is a path in block form.
Then I read this:

 (objects are shown as their names for illustration)

So I think the original path block could be:

`[make object![..] 210x392 make object![..] 210x8 make object![..]]`

Then at the end I see a path in the `dump-tree` example

`base:87x72/list:87x72/button:67x26/text:16x16`

So I ask myself:

Is this the real form of the path as block above?

what `base`, `button` and `text` rapresent? Just a type or those words are bound words, so you can do

Does SPACE handle this hierarchy in `path` where each item is divided by slashes, or it accepts also the block form?

In the above mentioned path, how `pick/-2` could happen if the path is at root?

This chapter is really confusing for me. If the path is expressed only in the form with slashes, it would be important to show this before any block form, and then write that the path form is the only accepted but you are showing it as block just for explanation purposes and it is never used.

I don't see why this is bothering you.

Ok, now things are starting to be more clear.

* You express hiererchy of (space)objects in 2 ways: 
  1) Virtual Red Paths
  2) Virtual Tree Paths

Other than for visualization, when they are returned for real, as red datatype?  You write that from `/parent` and `/map` originates path, so it is not a virtual one, but a true red path and maybe even with each word bound. 
Also, Is it correct to say that a _tree path_ which has size as pair, does not originate from `map` and parent`?

You use virtual paths to visualize:
* Block of objects (in case of non pointer events)

Ok,it is correct to assume that a virtual path is NEVER stored as `name:pair` in any facet? Is it just for visualization?

But you make this example:

As you write:

```

I have supposed you could move paths around with each word carring a space like

Please reconsider this choice and add a sigil or no one could use the console without having a lot of doubts when using

Again, no idea what this is, where it comes from, or how it is related to `list-view/list/item/paragraph` tree path. Even `somefacet:` is of your own invention.

I disagree about the sigil. To read mold output it's enough to understand that no weird urls are present in spaces' code. For illustrations in the docs it may be useful, but may also be harmful. Besides, there's no single one-size-fits-all notation. As I said in the code you'll only encounter tree path as block of objects. But for the purposes of style and event definition you will write them as paths of words.

You have a fresh eye, true, but also your own personal set of misconceptions, very vivid imagination and more inclination to perpetuate a misconception than to figure it out. I do note your critique but also cannot assume that your perception will be common. Hopefully Christian Ensel will notice this talk and share some of his experience as well.

1. I don't know if there is a non-trick way to do it. I wonder even if it's possible. How does the view know which mode you want?

I mean in separate windows, not on the same one. You can use a refinement on view or layout, or an option at the start of the GUI description block, so the window is opened in the console.

I have tested it. Changing to `1x1` solved the shadow problem but 2 things have emerged.
1) If you use `1x1` with the cat emoticon, RED hangs, I mean the console become black and nothing is printed.

`Pen` and `/color` depends heavily on what you draw. A text has background and font color; another withget may contain multiple colors for its core part and for its element. I don't want to go deeper on this topic. It is ok for me to stop here.

I do not mean constraints, I mean one has to model the design in the head. I see that authors didn't have this picture. Even the basic understanding that XML attributes are unordered, while SVG operations are, they clearly lacked, then tried to patch the result someplaces. Then inheritance: it has to be well and clearly defined before the design even starts, but I have to stitch the inheritance model from all around the spec to get any idea of it. And so on...

As we are finishing the tab navigation support for View, I have a query for the UI and Windows experts here. Tab-panel navigation is weird in Windows by default it seems. I have made a simple VBA test app to check it:

1. When Page1 tab is selected and Page2 is hidden, the tab navigation still happens through the hidden panel. Does anyone know if that is a standard behavior in Windows apps? (It happens in VBA because of the tabIndex property that gets incremented automatically as new controls are added to the form and navigation then occurs by blindly following the tabIndex order...)
2. When shift-tabbing from field "3", do you think that the next focused faced should be the bottom control in Page2 or the Page2 tab title?

If you preferred something like `<draw>...<move>...</move>...</draw>` I think the reason was the same as having `<a>` for anchor: simply brevity. They were times when Internet was quite slow, I do not know SVG well enough to make criticisms though.

@luce80 I don't disagree that brevity is the reason, however this is the most basic element where SVG departs from XML semantics and starts using its own subformatsâ€”thus you can't manipulate paths using the XML API, you need an additional encoder/decoder.

I'm not arguing that the drafters should have followed XML semantics to the end, rather at the point they brooded over `d="..."` they should have concluded that XML was not appropriate for this format. That they did not leaves us a confounding legacy.

Yes but if you have a text, a button  and a field all of the same size, you should create 3 styles. In this way you have the size only in one and all the others will change with it.

Yes, that appears to be an innovative way to do that. I can't say I've run into that requirement yet.  I am just in the process of integrating style into 'direct-code' and would be interested to know what the scenario is that requires the layout to behave that way?

Usually elements aligned vertically or sharing the same font size and colors, or anything else which has uniform properties.

hi :)
to move a face to the top just move it to the tail of its parent's /pane
dragging constraints are a bit tricky and do not work if you add `loose` flag, instead try setting options directly `view [size 300x300 base with [options: compose [drag-on: down bounds: (object [min: 30x0 max: 30x200])]]]`

I was able to find a quick example on how to reverse the pane face list.  `test/pane: reverse test/pane`
I need to spend more focused time working with events as this is my first time doing this sort of thing.  I know I need to capture the index of the face being selected, and based on your description above move it to the last position in the pane list.  Then I will need to monitor the over event to see what face I have moved over,  swap the initial offset of both of those faces while moving them appropriately in the face list.  Sounds easy in practice, and I know it will be shockingly easy when I finally get it.  One step at a time.

I likely have some misunderstanding in what you posted.   Are you saying to `move` the faces block in the pane series, and that will redraw the window where the pane was moved?  I have tried the most basic move using a simple block of blocks, and the behaviour was not what was expected.

Window panes are nested, so I must build something recursive. Also leftmost position is calculated as the sum of all parent containers + offset.

I bet that using command line will be the easiest way to go. You may still use `call` from Red, if you want some higher level. If it is Java, it is running java scripts using the java interpreter anyway.

Minor improvements were done on the Java bridge in my private Android branch. So the bridge version in red/red should be usable (not all of Java types and JNI accessors are yet supported). Though, such bridge requires libRed, which I'm not sure how stable is now, as I didn't test it much since a while. Last but not least, you'll need a 32-bit JVM in order to do such bridging for now.

Well, it seems I hadn't put enough `to-integer` in my source, the more the better. This is a bit annoying since things seem to be converted to/from integer!/pair!/point2D! when needed and , e.g. while `face/offset` seem to be converted to point2D! on the fly, the scroller's fields MUST be integer! while I was calculating them based also on `face/offset`. And what about the "hotness" of  its fields possibly related to reactions (?) ... ?

Yes I am talking about the facets of the scroller of a `flags: [scrollable]` face. They must be integer. Also you get different behaviour debending on how many time you read or write them, so  some time I have to put, say ,a `scroller/position: scroller/position` to make things work but then if I have a `?? scroller/position` more then what necessary I get wrong behaviour. This works:
```
			scroll: function [face [object!] pos [integer! ] axis [word!]][
				face/child/offset/(axis): to integer! 1 + negate pos ;@@ "1 +" because this must be 0-based
			]
			on-scroll: func [face [object!] event [event! none!] /local axis scr pos][ ; function "layout" inspired by @cosacam1 version
				axis: pick [y x] (any [event/orientation 'vertical]) = 'vertical
				if all [axis = 'y any [not scroller/y/visible? event/ctrl?]] [axis: 'x] ; FIXME: better use shift ?
				scr: scroller/(axis)
				pos: scr/position
				scr/position: min max 1 switch event/key [
					up left				 [pos - scr/min-size]
					down right			 [pos + scr/min-size]
					page-up page-left	 [pos - scr/page-size]
					page-down page-right [pos + scr/page-size]
					track				 [event/picked]
					wheel				 [pos - (scr/min-size * to integer! event/picked)] ; forwarded event by on-wheel

				scroll face scr/position axis ; use an overwritable function

do you have any reproducible snippets where `?? scroller/position` or `scroller/position: scroller/position` affects things? (it sounds like wrong use of reactivity to me)

I do not have a small snippet but placing `?? scr/position` before the call to `scroll` in the previous snippet gave me problems. I always told that I don't understand reactions well, so I am not able to use them correctly. In this particular case it is more difficult because reactions are used also by the scroller engine.

IIRC when you get a menu or resize event you basically yield control to the OS, which then only calls your window function with the menu or resize events (and maybe timer, don't recall atm), and pretends that no other events are queued, and stays in this mode until menu is closed or resizing is finished. It will require low level experiments to figure out if it's even possible to fetch and process other events during that time, but clearly current View implementation doesn't allow that. To filter events you need to know what's pending.

I don't know why you are bothered with menus. Events are queued, Red/View takes them one at a time and tells you what it is, so you do what you want. With "filter" I mean skipping, erasing, removing, not-accounting-for, those events that are too much and not necessary to process. You can do all this in a simple way if you have `port!`s. Until they are implemented it would be nice being able to do it some other way. Perhaps if `do-events` returned the NEXT queued event...

I have only skimmed it but I think you are over-complicating things. I have also re-read the source of `do-events` and perhaps it needs a little retouch. I'd like to be able to do something like in my `eat_events`:
```
do-events/stop ; (perhaps using the exit-loop variable? or with PostQuitMessage?)
while do-events/no-wait [] ; do processing of pending events
do-events/continue
```
If you really want to care about the "quality" and priority of events you can still modify the central line to a more sophisticated one.

As some of you hate the `facet= expr` notation in VID/S, I was considering an alternative to it:
- let `facet: (expr)` be the form of facet assignment
- let `as name: style-name facets...` be the form of naming individual spaces

Drawback is that if you would put that into a `function`, it will also collect all the facets as locals (it won't affect anything, but just bloats the function).

Thumbs up or down if you (dis)like this idea :)

Why don't use line-spacing to do the lines overlapping?

1. It's not a feature. The behavior of a smaller line-spacing depends on the implementation. As we use OS API, it's not cross-platform.
2. We cannot control how it's overlapped. For example, how to make two lines half overlapped by using it?

Non-local flow control is tricky enough in simple cases, but you've added thunks (code to eval somewhere else) to the mix. In your example the code is simple, but the the block you pass to `test` doesn't know it might be interrupted, so it may leave things in an invalid state. To avoid that every author of those passed blocks (the `thunks`) has to know this could happen and account for it.

> <@pekr:matrix.org> qtxie: would like to ask about the TUI. I have compiled the non gui console. Tried to run tui.red in Tests dir, but it returns `rtd-layout has no value` error. So - how am I supposed to use TUI? I have noticed, there is `Needs: 'View config: [GUI-engine: 'terminal]`in the header. There is a paradox, that it can be run with GUI console, just the output is too small. So - is TUI supposed to work in terms of MSDOS console, or via a serial port (once such port would be available), etc.?

Don't use the gui console. Add `Needs: 'View config: [GUI-engine: 'terminal]` to the CLI console, that is `console/CLI/console.red`.

Nice, thanks. Not understanding TUI's big picture yet, but if it is going to be integral part of the console, the console.red should be altered to include the header. If not, separate dir should be created, so that apart to Console, GUI-Console, there would be TUI-console.

greggirwin (Gregg Irwin):  
After some experimenting here is the design pattern that seems to have emerged
```
Red [

]

on-tab-away: func [
    face [object!]
    event [event!]

	if all [
		(event/key = #"^-") ((event/type = 'key-down))
	][
		if find face/extra 'on-tab-away [
			do bind face/extra/on-tab-away 'face
		]
	]
	return none
]

if not find extract system/view/handlers 2 'on-tab-away [
	insert-event-func 'on-tab-away :on-tab-away	
]
print-fullname: does [ 
	print [ "Full name:" firstname-field/text " " lastname-field/text ]
]

view [
	text1: text "First Name:" right
	firstname-field: field focus 
		on-enter [ print-fullname ]
		extra [ on-tab-away: [ do-actor face none 'enter ] ]
	return
	text2: text "Last Name:" right 
	lastname-field: field 
		on-enter [ print-fullname ] 
		extra [ on-tab-away: [ do-actor face none 'enter ]]

Maybe an `on-tab-away` actor might resolve all of this extraneous code?

I was just using this as an example, in actual use the on-enter would involve more than just calling one function.

You are right it isn't special enough. What unfocus needs is to do is report the event/key so that the reason for the unfocus can be determined. This is especially import for data validation. Try this: 
```
	text1: text "Enter numbers above and below 10 and press ENTER:"
	field1: field "8" on-enter [ 
		either ((int-val: to-integer face/text) < 10 )  [ 
			print [ "valid integer = " int-val ] 
			set-focus field2
		][
			request-text "Input NO GOOD"
		] 
	]
	on-unfocus [
		PRINT "ON-UNFOCUS"	
		do-actor field1 none 'enter
	]
	return
	field2: field
	```
A lot of unfocus actions happen inadvertently because the event/key isn't identified.

Thinking about this, you don't need the TUI event system at ALL, only the rendering. In case of remote connection your code should wait for a port and print on screen what it receives. Local keys could be read with an on-key event and managed from your actor.

That sounds like it will be more confusing, because you could `compose` layouts with `vid-compose` in them. :^) In any case, you should be able to mock up a mezzanine version to see if it really helps, and how hard it is to understand what it will and won't compose, because how can it know?

> <@greggirwin-55659ddb15522ed4b3e1006f:gitter.im> That sounds like it will be more confusing, because you could `compose` layouts with `vid-compose` in them. :^) In any case, you should be able to mock up a mezzanine version to see if it really helps, and how hard it is to understand what it will and won't compose, because how can it know? That's also why something a little smarter, or with more control, has been around a long time. Ladislav's `build` dialect, and variants. I can't be the only one who played with the idea.

A layout with VID-COMPOSE would have it's block composed only at LAYOUT/VIEW time while a compose on a structured block, when inner sub blocks are not shadowed, would be triggered from any upper level compose. Also, to avoid mental gymnic I think it is better to have the trigger command where the replacement happens, so you avoid seeking where the COMPOSE/RESHAPE command is and which parameters it has.

In spaces making such style is relatively trivial, e.g. their "accordian example" is a `list-view` with 3 items, where each item is a list with variable length (1/2), thus hiding or showing the contents item. But I don't have an out of the box example. I'll add it to my miles long TODO list :)

I am playing with VID code prettifier for panel, tab-panel and group-box.
I am leaning toward what I am calling under-dent formatting. Which would take something like this: 
```
    panel1: panel 103.221.7.0 [
        button1: button "button1"
        return
        button2: button "button2"
    ] extra [name: "joe"]
    button3: button "button3"
```
To something like this:
```
    panel1: panel 103.221.7.0 
        [
            button1: button "button1"
            return
            button2: button "button2"
        ]
        extra   [name: "joe"]
    button3: button "button3" 
```	
The main issue I am trying to solve for here is the un-named layout block that just seems to float around without any obvious home creating noise between other facet values and VID objects. Is there anything obviously problematic with this approach?

no, it means that if `molded length < limit` then contents remain flattened (which `orig` represents)

So just to be clear you only wanted to prettify orig's longer than the limit? I thought limit was protection against prettifying too much.

I have run into some short draw blocks that would be improved with use of prettify. Maybe having the limit amount as a prettify refinement would make it flexible enough for all uses?

This also seems to align somewhat with the old [view-ctx](https://gist.github.com/greggirwin/1405f2f8d93c4c066474d6cf5f47e6c6) example I did. The goals always seem to be connecting faces with contexts. The issue is that VID was not designed with this in mind.

So we can add features like this, but that is not "design". For example, as soon as you have faces inside your `inner-VID-build-and-bind` block that you *don't* want bound to the same context as the others, what do you do? Your system also relies on pre-existing contexts which have to be kept in sync with the layout set-words, right?

There are several solution to this. If you bind the upper block level before `layout` and make it modular, you may develop panels outside and they will be shielded from binding by their word.

You could even mix the topmost context with the current panel context, sequentially binding at `do/compose` site, obtaining with the same declarative priority as nesting objects with panels in each one. The other solution is the qualification of block with a keyword inside of it and and a special binding by keywords. I have developed this solution but I thinks it is too much to ask to implement it.

Actually if the right cursor navigation arrow is "playing" then there is something wrong. I'll give a better description like: Control Key Button (but only on the right side of the keyboard). Historically this is a throw back to the AS400 where: Right Control Key = Enter Key.  You are right the description for control + (tilde) is incorrect. It should read Control + (back tick). Because Ctrl + Shift + Tilde = Open Editor for style of object. Thanks for the feedback Gregg.

That's far from true. Take a look around the web: how many tables you can (or want to) actually edit? Say, on Wikipedia or GitHub or somewhere else. As long as it's not your data you only need sorting/filtering at most, and only for big enough tables, which are less than 10%.

The main issues with the editable table are:
1. A lot of code that a read only app (e.g. a markdown renderer) won't need. In my grid-edit demo I provide even a sample database, just fast enough to accommodate the filtering. If you're using a real DB you don't need that. I may be able to improve the UI code size in my next gen spaces design (have some ideas for that), but the DB part is still a big adhoc chunk. 
2. There's no standard UX agreement for table editing, partially because there's a *lot* of features to support and you have to choose one or the other, e.g. a click on a column header may edit it, or allow you to sort by that column, or allow you to reorder columns by dragging, but not all of the features at once. And some features are very rarely used, e.g. column name editing even a database table editor will not expose to a single click event. In the end whatever UX you come up with will only be good for a singular app use case, and all the other apps may wanna alter it. 

My goal with Spaces is to build for a majority of use cases and let the minority cases be added as simple as possible, and provide some example templates, but not to force any arbitrary UX of my choice or include every battery ever existed. The principle of diminishing returns works well on the table widget. E.g. how many DB editor apps will reducers make? And how big will their UX effort be compared to coding the overall functionality of the app?

hiiamboris: I agree with your common use-case design model. But I also think a good majority use case is simple spreadsheets/tables. We can argue how simple it can be while still offering enough features or how much data it can handle. I also agree that filtering is key, to make it manageable and facilitate data research.

Even with just a few of us, there is no consensus, and I don't expect there will be. So we think about a *specific* thing we can build, which covers a reasonable number of use cases, and go from there. I still fondly remember tinkering on rebocalc, and Nenad's nanosheet. Fun toys that give us a different model for thinking.

Coming back to the Go tablewriter, I remember using https://www.tablesgenerator.com/ quite a bit at one point, because text table formats are such a pain to get right by hand.

greggirwin (Gregg Irwin) we all have different needs and experiences, and this one doesn't matches my own, so would I ask to give some examples for me to plan forward from. Where do you see simple *editable* tables most often? Spreadsheets don't count as it's a huge project to undertake if approached seriously and too singular to support IMO. Windows explorer is what we most often see, but that one is also a huge project.

I've recently encountered one app that allows (a very awkward) in-place editing on a small table, but I can't count it because the app itself was a kludge to transform PeaceEQ config into ViperFX with a totally unnecessary lot of manual work and little to no automation; a flaw of the PeaceEQ itself that it doesn't support any of the popular export use cases, patched by having a separate program, which should have used a proper EQ UI instead of the table one.

* > a good majority use case is simple spreadsheets/tables

greggirwin (Gregg Irwin) we all have different needs and experiences, and this one doesn't matches my own, so would I ask to give some examples for me to plan forward from. Where do you see simple *editable* tables most often? Spreadsheets don't count as it's a huge project to undertake if approached seriously and too singular to support IMO. Windows Explorer is what we most often see, but that one is also a huge project.

I agree that we all have different use cases. My thoughts on spreadsheets are, perhaps, not "serious". That is, not full commercial capabilities, but the model of a table with calculated fields, and what Red can add to that in programmability.

Examples:

1) A camera control system where a single physical (remote) camera may be mapped to multiple logical (virtual) cameras. e.g. different PTZ settings. The physical attributes are shared, and the virtual attributes may be relative to each other, e.g. trigger times. You want to see all those together, and maybe have their relative values calc'd.

2) Event management. For me this is a Theatre Season schedule calculator and checklist. At a high level it's a coarse calendar, where some fields are calc'd (e.g. you backtrack from opening night to when photos have to be done, program info submitted, and suggestions for when to hold auditions and start rehearsals). Someone suggested Google Tables for this, based on a spreadsheet I did, but that now seems to be gone and is called AppSheet (a no-code tool). I just laughed out loud at their intro video "It's as easy as 1, 2, 3...". Still taking in the shadow of Lotus. :^) Tangent here. AppSheet is, at a glance, a DB app like Access or PowerBuilder.  Look at the table here: https://youtu.be/HOELR0LFNIM?t=245

3) Lesson tracking. Student, lesson, done [date!], rating, notes.

4) Rental/loan of equipment, tied to invoicing/estimates.

About 3-4. What would be the reason for people to prefer a custom Red solution over just their familiar spreadsheet program?

[14:51:51](#_9r6wyilqoWXUTWkDx8J_-OuABeqfXRak-gilfvugYA) <mikeyaunish>:
This is the most important question to consider. What originally motivated me to build something like that in Rebol was that there was a point in spreadsheet land that became way more difficult than I was willing to accept.

[17:11:31](#RxSd9bGOvHgZpLLXNfHSAN6WieBVL9JRstyUtLqNp_o) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
mikeyaunish: makes a key point. Many people, myself included, can set up a basic spreadsheet, and manually copy/paste and edit things. Then you realize you want a log/audit feature. e.g. *when* did a student complete a lesson? Ah, we'll just make that a date formatted field, though I'd really prefer a checkbox, and a place to add notes to go with it. Oh, wait, why are my references broken now? How long has that been going on? Is it broken on all the various sheets I keep separately for students?

So this gets down to the idea that I have been trying to address with Direct Code. For most everyone the barrier is always: how hard will it be and how long will it take. If either of these is too difficult, then they won't use it. I am starting to see that Direct Code is simply a "GUI Component Dispenser". If someone can easily get a GUI component on a page doing something close to what they want fairly easily then they are motivated to continue, as long as their aren't any crazy difficult barriers in the way. 

[0:40:19](#y794L9n-zyLhMVDfKbHNtsS92vXdxgQ5Yr2IlYsPPZU) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
Agreed. I think this is why VB took over the world in its time. I saw some horror-show projects done in VB by non-devs, but the point for me was that they were able to build something at all, and solved real world problems. It doesn't matter what "real" programmers think.

I think I have found an interesting and useful effect by setting selected of a field to one more than the length of the field
```
view [
	field1: field "hello"
	button1: button "Add to field and move cursor to end" 
		on-click [
			field1/text: rejoin [ field1/text "Z" ]
			field1/selected: to-pair ((length? field1/text) + 1)
			set-focus field1

I like this behavior because it seems to be the only way to position the cursor of a field to the end of the field.

Well unfortunately this hack plays a central role in the newest version of 
[table-template](https://github.com/mikeyaunish/table-template) which now allows input the same way any spreadsheet does.
The old cursor control limitation strikes again. Well for the time being this version of table-template
works fine. I guess I know where my next challenge resides. Creating a field with full cursor control.
 Now that I have it working this way I don't know if it needs the old input technique any more.

I personally have to inspect each file and can't automate my task but in the future I would like to convert the PDF to TEXT and search inside of it for classification, or use an AI to categorize it and then have my Red script to its job.

Have you tried Photoprism? I'm not sure but it may do that already.

So, if I have a text in an AREA and it is the text version of REBOL block, to save it I should LOAD and then save it?

Yes. Trap any errors when loading it. You can also use `transcode` or do something like this: https://gist.github.com/greggirwin/91dc025b1c25b9efc24996af0207bde2

What confuses me is that in FIELD, what I write in /DATA is FORMED; instead if I LOAD a RED file in a WORD and I want to set a GUI element with its contenet, I must MOLD it.

Even I need to revisit the text/data behavior at times. They generally sync up automatically for you, but `area` may not. I'd have to check. :^) I would also have to look up where the best references to this are. hiiamboris may know off the top of his head.

My goal is to LOAD a config file, which is text based. It then loaded into FACES using `FACE/TEXT: mold CFG/NAME` and then write it back to file when needed. 
I must say that without MOLD, if modifying the text would modify DATA on place, it would be al lot easier

One of the projects in my/our list is a general scatter/gather UI data exchange system. Forms, as used in Access and other DB tools, should be a no-brainer to do, and that kind of system would add a lot of practical value to Red, especially since the GUI is already there.

Not sure if this intended behavior. But selecting the menu from a drop-down only 
works properly when the menu is activated while hovering over the down arrow symbol. It does not work if you
activate the menu over the text of the drop-down.
```
view [
		dd1: drop-down data ["one" "two" "three" "four"] select 3
		on-create [
			face/menu: compose/deep [
				"File" [
					"Load" ld
					"Save" sv

There is definitely something funny going on here. I played with various literal options, which worked directly and indirectly, as in Boris's example. Then tried this.

d-1: ["A"] append d-1 read %/C/Users/Gregg/Desktop/notes/
d-2: ["B"] append d-2 read %"/C/Users/Gregg/Desktop/Time Wasters/"

Try with clear+append+show, and also with just append+show.
