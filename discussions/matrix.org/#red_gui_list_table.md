Is it orphaned from the Red rooms space?

I will start a Wiki page on the table-template repository I am working on. I am not certain that this should be a REP at this point. A good portion of what we are looking for already exists in the template. Unless we want all this built into Red, but I don't think so.

Are you using a custom requester to do that? Not sure if that would help.  Do you have your work in a repository we can look at. Or if you want send me your version and I can merge it into my fork (with full credit of course). I am thinking we can break up the work involved to fill out the table-template. I can see already that a "read-only" table may involve touching a lot of code so we would need to coordinate. If GiuseppeChillemi (GiuseppeChillemi) wants to continue on his spec list and validation we could make a pretty good team.

I haven't even tried this part of the table functionality yet. What have you tested this with so far? Just looking through your code now. Also pushed your previous changes into the repository. Have you any experience with testing GUI apps like this. I've some rudimentary things I've been doing with Macro Creator but we will need something more robust than that given how much ground this component is covering.

[9:48:46](#o6Ih39XuBNsIw0RBfdsZydtfFwpmAKDR3a6-1190C0A) <kavina computers>:
mikeyaunish: I will highly recommend that you do not push changes please test how and why, can it be improved more? if yes. we will recreate this feature. random mouse click and entry to frame render I checked with rapid mouse clicks on UI also with time delay to see queue - instead of rewriting event flow system - I tried - than more I look into it by default it has sync off/on system so creating guard it will not allow re-entry means it will not have circular update patterns. for more sophisticated system, event-manager,event-handler, dispatcher, guard, throttling, update-guards,keyboard-events,mouse-events,visual-updates. what I mean is default entry point already provide good system adding some guards can eliminate 95% edge case with minimum code added. So take what I give as demo may be we can improve over it or discard and work on new thing.

The table itself is meant to behave like a spreadsheet, so no independent actors are supported right now.  There are very few other action that could be useful that aren't already consumed. Which actors do you see using while still preserving the integrity of the spreadsheet like interactions?

kavina computers: I decided to put these first few changes in because they clearly illustrate the challenges that "advanced" cells present. So I like play with and experiment a bit to learn how I would like the program to behave. This is good, because it seems we have discovered the first puzzle to these kinds of table advancements.  GiuseppeChillemi (GiuseppeChillemi) question about actors is pointing in the same direction. I will post the puzzle to the main feed of this room so that everyone can take a look at it.

Puzzle: How to interact with advanced "cell widgets" without interfering with the regular spreadsheet actions. Example: A simple toggle button in a cell to represent true/false. If you click on it does that mean you want to change the toggle state or select the cell? It appears that we may require something that allows an EDIT mode and an interactive RUN mode. Anyone have ideas about this?

After adding some of kavina computers changes I realized some more some fundamental work needed to be done. Interesting how difficult just cursor movements can be (for the edge cases). I'd also like to nail down frozen vs. header behavior before adding the fancier features.

GiuseppeChillemi (GiuseppeChillemi):  Have updated a new version of table-template at: [table-template](https://github.com/mikeyaunish/table-template). I keep finding corner cases where the display of the table isn't properly rendered when using the cursor or page up and down buttons. Could you give the new version a torture test and see if you can find any more areas where the display doesn't sync with the cursor action.

* Your examples are an inspiration to build something that I knew would be needed, which is a table-lab program. So that tables could be built and experimented with. The format of the Red file you provided has some errors in it. I am interested in the steps you used to create it so I can better understand where the error occurred. Here is the corrected version:

When launching the script (exemple usage mentioned before), I could test the auto save option. As I use red IDE in order to write and launch red-lang scripts, I had a notification that my file %company-table-data.red has been modified by an antoher program and asked me if I want to open it.

The only valid 'option' is auto-save. The rest of the table configuration needs to be left in the "Red" data file. Start with a simple data block. Change the formatting as you wish. Then use the Save As menu to save the resulting data and formatting with a ".red" extension on the filename and you can reload the file from there.

If I creatae a table adding an `on-down` event, I get the current cell `1x1` but the cell I am cliccking on is not selected.

Wow, you are doing some fancy foot work there. The right mouse is set to open the menu. The middle mouse button is available to use as is. It just doesn't position the cursor to the cell that you are pointing at. It shouldn't be too difficult to enable cursor positioning with the middle mouse button as well. I am curious to know what you happens in your app when this different buttons are pushed. I like to understand the entire scope of the solution to better understand how tables will be used.
