Welcome @MarkoSchuetz_gitlab!  If you start at red/home here, you'll find all the rooms. We don't have a specific room for design, so this one is fine for that right now. It's general. 

You'll find that DDD in Red falls heavily into the realm of Red as data, and leveraging dialects. e.g. if you're writing a GUI, you use `view` and VID (Visual Interface Dialect). If you're writing parsers and your own DSLs or dialects, you use `parse`. `View`, `parse`, `draw`, and one more are the primary standard dialects in Red. 

But you can't use dialects without having underlying data, and that's one of the most important things to understand in Red. There are a lot of datatypes, which allows you to combine them in ways that suit your needs. Just as natural language is built up from parts of speech, but combined in endless ways. 

Red is a descendent of Rebol, which was originally design as a messaging language. Not just IPC, but the exchange of information between people and machines. This is central to architectural thinking, and more languages would benefit from it, Red just makes it more visible.

Two quick thoughts: 

1) This is where I hope the idea of our lab tools will go. I think `playground` is the other term some langs use now.
2) For an IDE, the idea of templates, or complete calls with default args, can work with Red even though we have free ranging evaluation. Maybe because I never quite got used to them, I rarely make use of the templates in my editor, though they pop up and remind me they are there. I still think they're useful, especially when learning.

@greggirwin @jsgrant There is a Chocolatey package, but only for the last release version (which is quite old by this point). It'd be possible to do nightly choco packages, but would require integration with the build system, as each build needs to be re-submitted/approved in the Chocolatey repository. I think the simplest way (for me anyway) is the [Scoop package](https://github.com/red/scoop-bucket). I periodically run `scoop update red -f ; "q" | red --cli ; red` to update and compile both consoles. No need to fiddle with the PATH or script wrappers this way too.
I suppose the scoop instructions should be added to the download page.

Not quite, because Red simply returns the func when you `do` it. The concept is the same, you just need to call the func, rather than `do`ing it. e.g. 
```

>> do func [ /local x y z ] body
== func [/local x y z][print 'x]
>> fn: func [ /local x y z ] body

Hello, 
I deleted all the console-xxx executables in folderC:\ProgramData\Red(Windows).
I deleted everything in that folder, actually.
I downloaded latest automated build and executed red-15dec20-708c7c277.exe --cli
This gave me two files, console-2020-12-15-57547.exe & crush-2020-12-15-57547.dll 
I installed the latest VSCode Red Extension (v0.4.2)
Renamed red-15dec20-708c7c277.exe to red.exe and saved @ C:/Development/RED/red.exe 
I set the VSCode Red Path to C:/Development/RED/red.exe in both User and Workspace.
Tried to run interpreter on simple red script:
-------------------------------------------------------------
Red []
print "Hello World"

@qtxie 
Ok, I understand.  
I will stop using the VSCode editor until a solution is found and go back to nodepad++ 
and a regular DOS Terminal.  It is just my opinion, but I think there is a need for a, dedicated, IDE for this language as it has a lot of potential especially for people sick of other bloated languages. If Red had something similar to the RStudio IDE for the R Language, it would surely accelerate adoption. 

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,

@mbennette68 I merged the fix. I'll try to push a new version today. It'll take a lot of time to build a dedicated IDE. The core part of the IDE is the editor. VSCode is quite good as an editor. I don't think we can build a better one given that how many man months has been put into it.

I did quite a bit of module R&D, and made notes. The main thing is that modules will be interpreted only to begin with, as modular compilation is a big task. On the bright side, that will let us vet the design before work goes into the compiler side. 

We do need flexibility, but also constraints, and taking into consideration how packages and remote resources will work over time, e.g. versioning. That means it may end up with basic features that other things can be built on.

For those of us who never used AltME, I'm curious what made it so special?

It was small and fast. Lacked modern features, as it's quite old now. e.g. no emojis or edit time on posted messages, but it was about efficient communication in a team.. The added features were plugins, so some versions had a bug tracker too, for example.  Worked great up to a hundred people or so, which is probably the largest group I knew of. Easy access control for groups and files. Also very simple to host your own server, as that was built into the same EXE. Run it with CLI switches, make sure one port is open on your firewall, and you're up and running. Foretold a lot of what we see in chat now, but in a "no distractions" mode like some modern editors. Also, all the data was plain Rebol so it was easy to process. One issue was speed when a lot of messages were in a group, so some of us wrote a read-only viewer since the data was accessible. Also easy to write tools to monitor folders and parse messages for special processing.

I'd have to look at old code to remember. `LIST` was an iterative face, which called back to code with the index to display via its `supply` facet. It didn't have a slider built in, so you had to connect a slider face to it, mapping the slider position against the number of items, and tracking the top item to show. So to add an item programmatically, you just increment the current top number and show the list face again.

@ldci Some time ago I have had an idea about an AI looking at User Interfaces an interacting with a program in place of humans. I have thought that this project  would bring RPA (robotic process automation) of programs to another level. Well, today I have made some research and discovered this technology exists. Sikuli http://sikulix.com is based on OpenCV, which is able to fully automate a GUI. I think it would be great to have RedCV recognize GUI elements, then only the interaction layer would be needed . This would bring RedCV and Red great power; also it could create lot of opportunities for us and acknowledgement for this project. I think that RedCV could have this capability but only its author could confirm this and make it possible. This is the reason I want to share this idea with you and all the other Red coders.

[18:59:51](#_p8vpWtiIIBF1jMbdMBBQ4ydlcdMQ_Wb_ICcTq7kJIY) <hiiamboris (NOT THIS ONE)>:
RPA requires identification of UI items by text labels, which is based on 2 strategies:
1) low-level navigation of all controls of all windows
2) OCR of screen shots

(1) is too far out of RedCV's scope, while (2) requires an external library dependency (namely, Tesseract)

[19:07:25](#B12f6EzHXbJpv8q314zFLhPwgZzfxiaJ190625E8htI) <hiiamboris (NOT THIS ONE)>:
Though I guess OCR layer itself (without layout detection) isn't that big a task, and if one plugs into it Tesseract's trained data, it could actually work.

Fun!

I find more and more uses for Thermal imaging.
I'm helping a friend who is a building a real castle (based on loosely on Neuschwanstein Castle).
It is 5 stories, and uses several methods to heat and cool the house.  Being able to SEE this is great.

But also, from time to time, it is nice to just look around a room and see what is 'ON' (devices you forgot about).

Funny thing, this is also a great way to SEE hidden cameras :)

Many years ago I used a Thermal camera to help a doctor and myself decide the best surgery for my nasal passages. 

I've also used it to see animals in the bushes around the property.

All of these are just like once a month, but it is really nice.  I wish it was built into the all cameras.

@pekr OpenCV 4 is now a mainly C++ code. Red binding allows to call about 600 basic functions from the C code core of OpenCV. This is sufficient for a lot of  classical applications. I stopped the support of OpenCV after the 3.3 version. I have to look if C functions are still supported in 4.0 version and newer.

Hi everyone. redCV proposes some routines and functions for DSP including, FFT 1-D and FFT-2D. I used some ideas form Mel Cepstrum and Toomas Voglaid's code. You'll also find a dynamic type warping method and some filters such as  a Savitzky-Golay filter. Regards

An important aspect that @Oldes points out is need. When someone needs a feature, that's the driving force. Then the rest of us can help with advice, snippets, and tools. What will also help on the binding side is a Red level FFI. Not necessary of course, but removes a barrier for many people, especially if we can make it easy to use.

What a wonderful opportunity for a Red based messaging application similar to Twitter.
With everybody being censored by large corporations. Doesn't Red have blockchain components? No centralised data centres needed or to be controlled by large companies.

Twitter scale is hard to do on a shoestring, but we have plans for a messaging app. We need to focus on a couple commercial endeavors first, like [DiaGrammar](https://www.redlake-tech.com/products/diagrammar-for-windows/), for sustainability.

Blockchains are slow, so also a big challenge for real-time apps of any kind. Side-chains and other solutions are the way to go there, but we're not there yet. There are also downsides to the blockchain approach for this kind of thing, because of their lack of control over content. That's a huge issue. Posting facts, data, and source code are one thing, but opinions are quite another.

@greggirwin When will Diagrammar be available? I have already written a Red application that  interacts with the Wordpress Woocommerce REST Api and it has a full delivery screen with customer data, scrollable and drag and drop fields which are scalable to full screen etc. It has many components like customer database, customer live search, order entry. I have made a custom bracket on my vehicle dash, which houses my Surface Pro, so I can click off the delivery fields as I deliver them, all the customer data is available to me at any time. BTW Red works really well on my Surface Pro X, running with 32bit emulation. And thanks very much to the team for the much faster compiler results.

Red is an amazing language, and every time I have to use PHP, Javascript, to write my own plugins, for my Woocommerce site, I cringe. Why can't they just use RED, I can do it 10x faster in RED. If only they turfed PHP, javascript and even HTML, everything could be done in RED, all the needed components could be exported through REST components, for people that don't want to go RED all the way. Such a shame, RED spoils you and hampers your learning progress in Other languages. :-)

@GiuseppeChillemi It took a while to figure it out, the hard part is having it scalable as well, which works mostly. So now I just click to full screen and every field with their containing panels  is automatically scaled vertically, and all the Drag and Drop still works. The fields are automatically added every time a new order comes in. I did a custom Scroll bar as well. How do I post a screenshot here. Will have to blur out the customers.

@GiuseppeChillemi I just changed the names and phone number entries. Any row can be deleted by clicking the X, rows will automatically be moved up. Any field can be edited, copied or pasted. The pay column fields are toggle buttons for different payment methods. The Box numbers are color coded according to Box Sizes and also are toggle buttons up to 7. The Yellow squares are buttons which open a sub panel for delivery instructions. The ToDo buttos are toggles to mark what has been delivered. The Green Buttons at the ends are the Drag and Drop Handles. The Scroll bar is obvious.

@GiuseppeChillemi @ldci Thanks.I am willing to share the code to do it, but seeing that it is only a small portion of the total code, and that I wrote this a long time ago, will have to go through the code to work out what I did. :-) From memory I used actions a lot, and it creates the panel dynamically. Also I kept adding functionality, so the code would probably need a complete rewrite, I wrote some ghastly stuff. :-) There is also a complete RED to HTML, JS, CSS, so that I can print labels using from a Web Page. PDF's were to painful to deal with. Would be nice if RED had a Print Module to interact with the Windows  Desktop App Printing API. One day I will look at how to do this.

@greggirwin Thanks, I don't know Vue or Hugo.
I just find the whole framework stuff is getting out of hand. Even WordPress has parts of the Admin and the Gutenberg Blocks written in React, so to be a Wordpress Dev, you basically need to know Html, CSS, PHP, React, JSON. It still has parts written in JQuery.  That is insane when you think, about it. All just to put pixels on a screen. I find it actually takes longer to learn the frameworks than the native language. If you look at the package manager in React, and what it is downloading, it is a mind boggling amount of code. Who would know what Facebook put in there to spy on people.  The browser engines are written in C/C++ and then have all these layers of nonsense on top, might as well do it all in C++ to start with. I have used RED in the past to quickly work out an idea, then write it in vanilla JS. I just learn another language if I need it to do a particular project.  And this is where RED is so opposite to everything else. Just one mainstream RED commercial application, is all it needs, something like Dir Opus, cross platform, and the devs will come. I'm only very part-time programming  ATM, learning Blender 3D at the moment, so I can print some 3D parts.

@GiuseppeChillemi Oh dear! That looks like a very cool project, but I just wonder if it will be seen as another framework type thing. So if any changes are made in any of those languages, it then cascades down to the next language above it. I wonder sometimes how much time would be saved by developers, just using the lowest common denominator at the start instead of contorting ones self through all those bugs, and code errors at multiple layers.

Coming from red/docs chat about parens in paths:

@GiuseppeChillemi I do *greatly* appreciate the examples. Look at all the innovation it's fostered. :^) Now we can compare different syntactic approaches directly. More thoughts.

- @Oldes' reference to the old "sticky space" ticket is applicable.
- @toomasv's `get-path` is a nice name. Is it good that it mirrors `get-path!` as a name, bad, or indifferent?
- Even in small cases, something like `(series)/(idx)/('mystruct/size)` is a "noisy" line to my eye. And the only place you *could* add spaces may make it even less clear as a path: `( series )/( idx )/( 'mystruct/size )`. 
- Parens as selectors also raise an ambiguity, the same as blocks do. With blocks you need to use `select/only`. What do you need to use for parens? Because they are evaluated by default, the rules are different. It's not that you can't or shouldn't use them as keys, but it means more rules to remember.

```
>> blk: [a (b c) d]
== [a (b c) d]
>> blk/(b c)
== none
>> select blk (b c)
== none
>> select blk '(b c)
*** Syntax Error: (line 1) invalid word at '(b c)
*** Where: case
*** Stack: load 
>> select blk quote (b c)
== none
>> select/only blk (b c)
== none
>> select/only blk quote (b c)
== d
>> blk/((b c))
== none
>> blk/(quote (b c))
== d
```

- In that console example, note that there's no  `lit-paren!` support. You can do `blk/'a`, but do you want to also do `blk/'(b c)`? What are the ripple effects for that new form and type?
- `Resolve` is a *really* nice name IMO. Looking at definitions, this one jumped out at me: "to become `reduce`d by dissolving or analysis". (emphasis mine)

To my eyes `'(a b)` is new great way of quoting, because it would be useful in another scenario: `compose`,  to quote parens in code and to avoid them being evaluated.

But we already have parens that don't get evaluated. They're called blocks. :^) And if you don't want your parens evaluated you can put them in blocks until you need them. It's seductive to think of lit-parens, but because evaluation is at the core of everything, add more rules about when things are evaluated can make it *much* harder to reason about.

About my selectors, they are not complex. In place of using `'mystruct/size`,  I often use something like`word/(idx)/(column headings   'size)`. Other times I use this `word/(select-row-gui 'word)/(column headings   'size)` where `select-row-gui`, as you can imagine, open a panel with a `text-list` containing the rows of a table.

Yes, we are looking at the same blonde: `lit-parens` are really seductive because they give additional control in `compose`when you use parens in blocks. Expecially useful when you need parens to group expressions to give priority like `... if (length? 'word) > 10 [a/(idx)/b] `

Greeg, it took years to me to acquire all the knowledge needed to start using dialects. It's not a newbie topic. But I remember being able to use understand and use parens in paths as soon I have read about them. That expressive way has accompanied me until now as one of the most simple and powerful to access block elements. It is a concept that every other newbie will master and use in few seconds. Everything is in one line and It's simplicity makes it a perfect power tool for anyone starting with Red. We need simple tools for immediate use just when someone starts using Red. Dialects are a thing of Pros. We would lose a powerful and ready to use instrument without parens in paths.

@GiuseppeChillemi There is no difference between REBOL and Red in this respect. If you want to use exactly same line of code to move forward then both REBOL and Red have to use same word, but you can change word on each line if you want, e.g.
```

== one

Yes. I have a PinePhone running Ubuntu Touch and Red works fine. Just make sure you run the Linux ARM version. You can even run Red/View by using the GDK branch.

BTW, PinePhones are selling really well on our site. They are selling out as faster than we are getting them in.

[4:36:17](#dgXQBPyFlMgvuNko7GAk3Mvdzb4ipwelrq3AcsY8xFI) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
Coming from red/chit-chat, @GiuseppeChillemi the Chrome bookmarks file contains a single string field which takes up about half the file. It's called `sync-metadata` and it takes about half the total parsing time here for just that field. That is, if I remove that field, it takes half as long to parse. 

Here's the rule for string fields:
```
	string-literal: [
		#"^"" copy _str [
			any [some chars | #"\" [#"u" 4 hex-char | json-esc-ch]]
		] #"^"" (
			if not empty? _str: any [_str copy ""] [
				;!! If we reverse the decode-backslash-escapes and replace-unicode-escapes
				;!! calls, the string gets munged (extra U+ chars). Need to investigate.
				decode-backslash-escapes _str			; _str is modified
				replace-unicode-escapes _str			; _str is modified
				;replace-unicode-escapes decode-backslash-escapes _str
			]
		)
	]
```
Note that it copies the string first, which has alternative rules for escaped characters. Then is has to handle escaped characters, which is does naively by parsing the string twice more, modifying it in place if needed. Note that this happens for all literal strings in the JSON, not just the big metadata string. While the code is very simple, it's also brutally inefficient. 

Just replacing the internal `translit` function used by the escape handling funcs with an R/S equivalent might not be too hard, and should provide a nice boost. Optimizing will require some heuristic choices for allocations if the string has to grow, but the rest of the codec might not need to be touched, giving us a good ROI.

Nope. You can only remove one key at a time. You can't use blocks as keys today, but we shouldn't rule that out as a possibility in the future. Also, the premise of `remove` is simple. If you need more, that's what wrappers are for.  Now... `pick` is an interesting one to consider, but I think we're OK with a `pick-multiple` wrapper until enough people ask for it.

On `/key ` with blocks, I didn't remember that this was supported, maybe hoping it wasn't because it raises other questions (general interface for key-val blocks). However, the reason and solution is that `/only` is not implied (and we don't want to complicate the interface for this IMO, so you need to do it like this: ` b: [[1] "foo"] remove/key b [[1]]`. 

If  `/only` is assumed, you can't use multi-value keys, e.g. `A 1`, which should be a much rarer need. That's broken today anyway, because it removes the next value after where the key is found, which is *part* of the key in that case.
```
>> b: [1 2 "foo" 3 4 5 "bar"] remove/key b [3 4 5]
== [1 2 "foo" 5 "bar"]

If others agree, the simple option is to open a ticket for using `/only` internally (%series.reds @L845) on series in this case, which lets this work for the most general case.

I'm against designing blindly, and not a fan of `remove/key` btw. It can imply `/only` and remove  block + value in the blocks. Will it also imply `/same`? What about maps? Will maps support block keys? Isn't the main use of `remove/key` maps, not blocks? And then why block keys and not any-block? ...Or it can take a block with multiple keys to remove? ...Or we may forbid block for key argument altogether. What is most reasonable behavior? Do we have use cases? And how does it fit into the big picture of other series funcs design? `remove/key` is already an outlier, unlike anything else in Red (or is not?), and twisting it further won't bring any beauty to it's design. Instead of extending special cases with other special cases we should focus on solutions that bring generality.

Personally, I think it would be better to have a true key-value interface for blocks, for consistency. Because `remove/key` on blocks today also doesn't enforce `/skip 2`, which makes it consistent with `find/select`, but I think not with tPoLS. 

`remove/key` exists as a workaround, really, so maps can hold all kinds of values. Originally, for those who don't know, setting a map value to `none` removed the key. That's how old associative arrays work, and most everyone else followed suit. But that meant maps could never have a `none` value for a key, which is a huge limitation, and makes for other workarounds users have to deal with. Using `unset!` as the special "remove me" value is no better. The old model is also inconsistent with anything else in Red.

No need really. But possible. Although then `index?` would have to return the key, not an integer.

> And if `at` is used, does it need to support `/case` for maps like `select` does?

Good point. My first thought then is to have `remove find map key` support, and `at` will be like without `/same` or `/case`. Or have just `find`, no `at`.

> Or is `/case` implied, as with `remove/key`?

See? That's why I already don't like `remove/key`. It has /case implied but it's name never tells that. I didn't even know that.

> And that leads to asking about all other series related actions.

Again, `at` (or `find`, whatever) support does not have to involve anything else. But let's play and imagine what is possible. We already have iteration (foreach), why can't we support `next` and `back`? We know it will be unordered iteration, and `skip map 2` won't make sense, but `next` and `back` will make sense, if only just to traverse the whole thing.
`append` and `insert` make sense and may work the same way `extend` does. Do we want them? If only for consistency with series, but I don't see any value here (yet).
`remove` when called repeatedly could empty the map (orderless). What `remove-each` is supposed to do but step by step. And `clear` already works on a map.
`swap` - would be possible to swap k/v pairs between 2 maps. Could be extended to blocks. 
`alter` won't work. `sort` & `reverse` too.

@giesse should not be than a `list!` type instead of `map!`?

I've heard that it's not easy to parallelize compilation, and that it usualy doesn't matter, because big projects have parts that can be compiled independently anyway (like classes in Java). This is not the case with Red, because we only have `#include`, `do` etc. to help with dividing code into smaller parts.

no, because a map is a series of key-value *pairs*. ideally that would imply a pair type, but, i don't really think it makes real difference. i'd be ok with it behaving like just a list of keys for the purpose of series actions.

you can't remove words from objects (which should really be named contexts, but, let's not digress). in fact, right now, you can't even add words. therefore, yes, contexts are very special.

I really don't buy the performance argument. First of all, i'm not sure anybody cares about preserving key order between insertion/removal. But even if you do, an additional linked list for the order is not such a big deal in the big scheme of things, and, in the general case usage that you have in Red it hardly makes sense to switch to some specialized structure; the current hashtable works and does preserve order.

the advantage is that it will behave like every other series and there won't be a need for hacks like `remove/key`. you'd automatically get `remove-each` as well as the other series natives and mezzanines.

`foreach` works with maps, why shouldn't `remove-each`?

I wasn't even sure I wanted `foreach` to work, but it does now, and it's a special case requiring exactly 2 words. So that's already an exception. Yes, it provides a shortcut, but now it's a justification for more additions which may over time weaken the core language.  Maybe weaken is the wrong word, but the idea that the more things the core language and semantics do, the more stuff is in there which has to be built, maintained, and considered for compatibility and general language understanding.

I often ask for use cases and concrete examples. What I may also start doing is asking what other languages support X, or if people using them have asked for X. This is *not* so we can include all those things, but so we can see holes that really need to be filled, benefitting users. That's hard, and may only be clear in hindsight, because some things that seem like a good idea will turn out not to be and we won't know until they've been around for a while.

Already for this request we have other ideas about removing multiple keys. Do we want that? If so, do we also want that for blocks? 

This is why I love, love, love using mezzanines to play with ideas. If an idea gains traction, and is refined over time, even entire suites of them for things like a single key-val interface to series/objects/maps, then we can make it standard and eventually convert to R/S or such.

In general, then, is it OK for me to say "Why shouldn't we take that approach, almost always?"

https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BDOC%5D-Red-Should...-(Feature-Wars) was originally meant for people coming from other langs and asking for features, but it just as readily applies to Reducers (myself and Nenad included). As I noted there:

Coming from Ì†ΩÌ±â [chit chat](https://gitter.im/red/chit-chat?at=60105aaad8bdab47395f3a1a)

It's important that people have choices, and there are a lot of big picture thoughts here related to the x-net, a Red browser, and more. I like and support the idea of UPXing (because it is an extra step, but can be automated) for a few reasons:

While it does add complexity, it reduces the wire and storage footprint. Yes, we have huge desktop systems with more RAM than we use (most of the time), even in an SBC context. But it all adds up. We do have to stop thinking in terms of floppy disks and more of "If you're a secret agent, you want your entire system to fit in your back molar and update quickly when the plan changes, and plans always change." In reality it's "how big is a web page and how easy is it to use?" That's our competition as much as anything else. 

Consider time. It's often our enemy. How many old versions of apps do you keep for compatibility? Do they have an environment they can run in? You saved that too? The data format changed and you need an old version? What if you could keep a history of every version, like we do with source code?

Don't think about us as devs, think about businesses, people in other parts of the world where cost gravity hasn't helped enough and maybe 256M RAM and 2GB storage is "all" they have. Maybe your user or "agent" is an IoT device.

This is about fighting complexity, and complexity isn't just code size. Code has space and time complexities as different axes. Sometimes you trade one for the other. As devices have exploded in resolution options, that adds complexity in having to deal with it. And not just for us. A user may have an *entirely* different experience on a desktop, browser, tablet, or phone.

The push to be popular, to follow trends and do what others are doing, to be competitive on their terms is a full time job. Trying to move software forward, for both creators and consumers is also a full time job. We have to choose how to spend our time. While fashion changes rapidly we have, as an industry, forgotten and lost so many great ideas and fundamental principles. My goal, and I think Nenad and I agree here, is *not* to harken back to the old days trying to be cool by doing things just like they were done then. That's following fashion. But to learn and take inspiration from how much they did with so little. Their creativity, borne of necessity, is what we need. 

Our "necessity" is very different today, but people haven't changed much at all compared to technology. Of course, people can be easily reprogrammed, as evidenced by the rise of the phone. People are great consumers, whether it be modern food or modern media. Give them what they want and they will eat all they can. What I hope we can do is let some light into the cave, lure people out, and empower them. Not just to build software, only a few will do that, but to explore their own creativity and curiosity whatever their circumstances may be. 

To that end, we have to distill things to their essence, while presenting them in a pleasing way. We have to include enough fat, sugar, and salt, that they enjoy the experience, but make it nutrient dense and show them that trying new things, simpler things, being more than a passive consumer, can be rewarding. This is what Personal Computing is about.

hey guys, i started to learn about red a few days ago, but the AV problem dont give me to compile my program... i have to compile to msdos, with a black console behind my program, to bypass the AV.. even then, when i changed the PE header from CUI to GUI, the AV started again to make me problem with the PE.. what can i do to bypass this??

@greggirwin Would have to look it over‚Äîobviously not being in a familiar language (Ì†ΩÌπÇ) it's not immediately clear how you go about getting started. In [latter View experiments](https://gist.github.com/rgchris/b6fdf694df53ea82af424c48abeeefac), I was moving towards a more free-form state-based approach to managing appearance and the behaviours when transitioning and some elemental functions to put the transitions into effect (e.g. **move face 100x10**)‚Äîvery much with the CSS model in mind.

I'd be inclined to say that specific functions (such as the above **move** or, say **fade** or **rotate**) are more important at an internal level, at a higher level it's more useful to specify how a thing should look in a given state and what parameters are needed when in transition.

@pekr I didn't remember that. It's an interesting space, and layered. 

The GUI use case is driven by modern UIs, but those are often more flash than substance. That is, there is "movement" but I'd like the HCI background and information on how useful they are. Helping to track flow or state change is proven to be helpful, rather than elements just (dis)appearing. And most systems have gone to static decals or flash popups rather than wiggling notifications.

Going beyond simple transitions, which are important, it's a fine line between something like games with sprites and interactive visualizations of data and systems. For us, we also have `draw` to consider. 

Do we have anyone here with scene graph experience?

The issue of higher level graphical layers is a very difficult one, without easy solution.  The top commercial entries are things like Unreal Engine (3d), Unity (3d), and Qt (2d) , and the old Adobe Flash (now continuing forward in the Haxe space and OpenFL).  In the 2D animation realm, the open source Starling add-on was excellent, and it has sprite sheets ,and all the basic animation things one needs for 2D games (a lot of games were made on that tool).  There are programming tools whose main claim to fame is the built-in animation and collision detection, such as RAD tools and GameMaker, not to mention the ecosystems of Roblox and Minecraft, which are the extreme end of "prebuilt".  There is also Google's Flutter project, which saved Dart from extinction, by building an incredibly complex layer that renders everything to bitmap so that it is OS independent. That is another extreme endpoint in graphical approaches.

IMGUI is the kind of product that might work for you if the graphical style of all the widgets they offered match your requirements, but for a roll-your-own universe like Red, i don't see that as the correct approach.

In the 2D world which is my wheelhouse, you need both primitive support (lines, shapes, text, etc.), and then there is the standard issue controls, which due to the dominance of mobile platforms have evolved into Android vs. IOS control styles and aesthetics. They copy each other back and forth, so it is a kind of always changing ping-pong match between Google and Apple, but one can certainly say that dark interfaces are dominating now, with horrendous color schemes and microscopic typography abounding. Certainly not a good time for people with limited vision. 

The Starling framework i mentioned above was particularly well designed; it gave you access to GPU accelerated 2D animation, which is mostly what people need. 3D is a giant can of worms that most programmers will avoid. Look at the credit pages for Red Dead Redemption game, and marvel at how many full-time people it took to build the shrubbery. 3D is a giant time sinkhole.

@greggirwin i finally put out a pre-release version of my Beads language, so now Red has at least some decent competition. I would say we cover different application spaces so we don't overlap that much, but as both are general purpose i would say we are lumped into the same "100% opposed to OOP paradigm" space.  Red has made a huge amount of progress, and it is nice to see your project expanding. Frankly getting people out of Java, and C++ both of which i loathe dearly, is quite a challenge, as inertia appears to be the most powerful force in the universe... so often in the history of programming languages, people have clung to outdated languages because of habit, and the reluctance to leave the herd.

I don't know if my previous message read as "yeah Red should have this" but that wasn't the intention at all. I was really wondering if such type system would benefit Red expressiveness-wise, out of curiosity. Right now I'm experimenting with petri nets, if I need something I'll tinker with the idea myself beforehand.
I guess the answer is that with its homoiconicity and parser, Red is already very expressive, and the benefits are possibly not that big in that direction. And regarding types, there will be exploration and experiments. Yeah, that sounds exciting. I'm not impatient, but sometimes I get very obsessed with ideas.
How would ports help with type experiments ? I don't see the connection

Would it makes sense to annotate the type of functions' outputs ? Is there a reason that they are not ?

You say "obsessed" like it's a bad thing. ;^)

We can certainly experiment with return type specs for funcs. The func spec dialect supports it, but I don't think there's any use of it internally today. They aren't used today because it hasn't been a pressing need, and has open design questions because of Red's dynamic nature. There may be cases where the compiler can't do the check, so there would have to be an interpreted fallback mechanism. But it's like @rebolek's dependent type experiments or  DbC stuff  some of us have played with, easy to do at the mezz level and explore ideas.

@greggirwin if we should consider security, isn't serious security hole, when `call/shell` is taking the _shell_ from [environmental variable](https://github.com/red/red/blob/18bc5f7468c71d04f3b229cf426fa7326fc672e3/runtime/call.reds#L396)?

@oldes, there are things that are out of our control. This is also where the `secure` dialect can help when we implement it. So you can for example, have a script that can't use `call` at all. We should also look at how to apply `secure` at the module level, because then you can lock them down in a sandbox, which should help catch more malicious actions.

Here's a fun little experiment. @mbk mentioned Go lang's `defer` a short time back, in one of our team channels, and I mocked up a mezz level version. But it was terrible and nagged at me. Here's a slightly less terrible version:

    do-deferreds: does [foreach blk cur-stack [attempt [do blk]]]
    
    set 'on-exit func [blk [block!]][push-defer blk]	; a.k.a defer; what the user calls to add a deferred call
    exiting:  does [do-deferreds pop-frame]
    entering: does [push-frame]
    
    set 'function-with-deferreds function [spec body][
    	body: compose/deep [
    		entering
    		__def-res: attempt [(body)]
    		exiting
    		__def-res

    	function spec body
    ]
]

outer: function-with-deferreds [][
	on-exit [print "leaving outer"]			; not done until the function returns
	print inner 1
	print inner 2
	'outer-result
]
inner: function-with-deferreds [arg [integer!]][
	on-exit [print ["leaving inner" arg]]	; not done until the function returns
	arg * 10
]

outer
```
All the tests for it are what you see right there, so be warned. But this is about things other than the functionality. 
- It's Forth-y in the style of writing tiny funcs that build up a vocabulary.
- It was about me understanding the concept, and maybe explaining it to others.
- It shows what we can do at the mezz level with just a small amount of code.
- It lets us play and think about ideas that are actually quite advanced in very simple ways. Before spending time on adding features in Red's core, it always makes sense to me to find out if we even *like* the idea, and see how it fits with Red. For example, should every function support them, or is a wrapper like this OK, because when you see `function-with-deferreds` it tells you that function is special.
- No, I haven't thought about things like real errors in the user's `body`, that `exit/return` are blatantly not considered, or that `entering/exiting` will surely collide with user's words. Oh yeah, deferreds are blocks not expressions or function calls. And `on-exit` doesn't check to see if you're in a valid func with deferreds. I had to leave something for you all to do. ;^)

So what is it? The idea is kind of like `finally` that other langs use with `try/catch`, guaranteeing that certain things will be called when a function exits, no matter what. That's where you do cleanup, etc. What `defer` in Go does, is let you sprinkle them anywhere in a function, rather than having to remember them all at the end. That's it. They are processed in the order they were declared, and I'm sure the Go folks thought deeply about the FIFO v LIFO approach. Were they right, or is LIFO better?

What use cases do you see for something like this? It's a relative of Design By Contract in my mind, where you can denote pre and post conditions, and invariants. These, like static typing, help more in large scale projects, but there are other ways to build robust software too. 

Happy Reducing!

All the tests for it are what you see right there, so be warned. But this is about things other than the functionality. 
- It's Forth-y in the style of writing tiny funcs that build up a vocabulary.
- It was about me understanding the concept, and maybe explaining it to others.
- It shows what we can do at the mezz level with just a small amount of code.
- It lets us play and think about ideas that are actually quite advanced in very simple ways. Before spending time on adding features in Red's core, it always makes sense to me to find out if we even *like* the idea, and see how it fits with Red. For example, should every function support them, or is a wrapper like this OK, because when you see `function-with-deferreds` it tells you that function is special.

@greggirwin 
1) It should *unquestionably* be LIFO.
2) Special function is not the right place. Instead, you should be able to use that on *every* scope level. And this is a problem on mezz level, as you have to `bind` that scope (block) every time.
3) It should transparently handle exceptions, returns, loop control flow (mostly impossible on mezz level).
4) The moment you used `attempt` you made your program a debugging hell Ì†ΩÌ∏É
5) And this is the hardest thing, I haven't solved it yet - when an error occurs in the code, it should not blame your `attempt code` or `try/all code`, it should blame the original code *at the position where that error comes from*.
6) Error in any of `on-exit []` (or `leaving []` as I call them) finalizers should be treated as an *error in code* from the POV of all outer (previously deferred) finalizers, be reported as `on-exit [..erroneous code..]` and should not prevent all other finalizers from firing. Same for control flow, e.g. `return` from any finalizer should call outer finalizers and pass the returned value transparently. Unless another finalizer replaces it by a new `return` or other control flow diversion, and this is actually one of tricky points.
7) This outlined functionality I consider a *must have* for any mature modern high level language, as it makes the code much more readable and lifts some implementation details off the coder.

@hiiamboris I noted those issues up front, to some extent. The conversation I hope to spark is whether the idea has value, is worth more than 20 minutes of work, and how it has fared in the wild's of Go (if anyone knows). This is, naturally a deep subject when considered for real, which is why it has to be worth it. On 5), if you haven't figured it out, it's a hard problem. ;^) What language has solved this most effectively? Or is it one of those things that *can't* be easily solved. Common Lisp is often noted in this area, but the more advanced, dynamic things you do, the harder it is to accomplish cleanly.

I think the reason that LIFO is correct is that (assuming this is all about resource cleanup) resources are used in a nested manner. First you open a file, then you open a socket, and copy bytes from the file into the socket. Since the socket depends on the file, that should be cleaned up first. Maybe it would be ok to clean them out of order, but it should always be safe to do it in a way that gets rid of dependencies first

This is a driving question. Clearly that's the reasoning in Go. And also, logically from their perspective, that resources are reverse-order dependent WRT cleanup. But what if they're forward order dependent? e.g. you have data flowing in, and need to close that pipe first.

```
defer-streams: function-with-deferreds [][
	; open input  stream
	; open munge channel
	; open output stream
	; >> process data
	on-exit [probe "close input stream"]		; not done until the function returns
	on-exit [probe "close munge channel"]		; not done until the function returns
	on-exit [probe "close output stream"]		; not done until the function returns
]

defer-streams
```

Do any lang's `finally` handlers use a stack model, or do you just write imperative code in the handler? Then, in stack oriented cases as with things like DB resources, as @zentrog:matrix.org notes, *you* have to remember to reverse their order and get it right. In a LIFO model, automatic is much better.

In some quick skimming, it sounds like Go still have a lot of wrinkles that need to be considered when using `defer`. That is, it isn't 100% magical and easy. They just say "Here's how to deal with this." which sometimes means opinion.

It seems to me that the `defer` pattern has a lot to do with imperative style programming, where it cleans up the temporal separation "If I use this now, I will have to come back to it later". I don't think it is as relevant if using some other model, like Actors, or event steams. Technically, in my example, the file and socket needn't know anything about each other, but there'd be a dependency if you had some OOP style file uploader class that takes an IO source as an input. In that case, it might be bad to close the file before you clean up the uploader. However, if there was an event source streaming data out of the file and an event listener streaming data into a socket, they are more independent.

@Oldes in the context that triggered the discussion where I saw this issue, yes, very much so. I was testing some network code for a customer and it failed with a crash. The error was mishandled in my error handler code, so the handler crashed and the error was lost. I still don't know what the error was, and I will probably not know for a while, so there is still unhandled problems.

When I think about it this way, losing that error actually gives a lot of extra work and lost chances for fixing an issue and making my code more robust, if it's hard to repeat. It's actually a fairly critical problem.

Mostly correct. There was an experimental R2 x64 build for Linux, but it wasn't stable enough to use. We have to write the 64-bit back end in any case, but that would still have been a helpful springboard. 64-bit means both coding and some big design decisions on cell size and such. It has long term implications, as things like the redbin format could be affected and need to remain portable and long lived.

What does have R2 in common with the Red becoming 64 bit? You can compile on another platform for the 64 bit OS target, still using 32 bit R2? The whole problem, as far as I can undestand, is the R/S and the code it produces, being just 32 bits?

@giesse, I thought I said as much, but yes. @pekr, that is correct. This is all under our control, and just a matter of priorities.

@pekr, it's not an excuse in any way. Do you know why we have GTK support? Because of @rcqls. They wanted it badly enough to put in a huge amount of effort. That got the flywheel moving and we could continue the work (which was still a lot, and ongoing). 

People want 64-bit, but that's not going to bring people to Red, or make them use it. I/O also only holds a certain set of users back. Features don't equal acceptance. 

Say we put in the effort. We drop everything else and do 64-bit. What do we gain? Now we can run on Catalina, but it doesn't change *anything else*, does it? Yes, a few of the users who ignored Red before Catalina will try it, but those are also the deeper devs who might not be put off using a VM or container. No, we don't want that as a solution of course, but it's life.

But Red is Open Source. This is where a champion *is* the model of how things get done. Someone wants something, they add it, and either the main project merges it or they fork it. If someone wants it badly enough, they should speak up and we'll *help* them. You bet we will. But they have to commit to. 

We all have our lists, and things we want. We may have to give up 6 or 8 other projects to do 64-bit. Do you want modules? A grid in view? A markup codec? A better `split` function and `format`? Do you think those will foster more or less adoption, and are they more useful? The environment only says *where* you can run Red, not what you can do with it.

Now - for me, Red is a better GUI experience for me already and I do consider GUI console using Red itself being one of the biggest achievement (some R2 projects tried, but all mostly failed). So yes, I can see IO being a show stopper for other native stuff, but you might be right, that DB might be worked on via a command line tool and parsing. I did some experiments with SQLite and it was poor man's solution, but worked for my simple need.

Almost 20 years ago now, if my comments are to be believed, I did some longest-common-subsequence experiments in R2, then ported it to `rebcode` (anyone remember that?). Did a number of things it seems, but only experiments, e.g. `diff` on blocks, `patch` dialect as code, so you could get a diff that was Redbol commands you could send somewhere and run it. Even a little GUI that showed diff offsets (at a glance anyway). 

I think this is still something that could be a new way of looking at things; block level vs text level. Anything we do to emulate things that have proven valuable (awk, grep, etc.) need to work on Red data as well as strings. Plain text as an interface had its day. Still valuable and *probably* worth supporting for legacy and adoption purposes ;^), but  we will save our future selves huge amounts of pain if we go all Red.

My Hackintosh crashed and I had to reinstall it from the scratch. As a result, I‚Äôm now running Catalina instead of El Capitan, which means no 32bit apps for me. As Red sadly still doesn‚Äôt support 64bit OSes, I must run Red in a container. Fortunately, I‚Äôm not using GUI very much, because currently, I can‚Äôt think of a way to run Red GUI version on Catalina (besides running VM with older macOS or Windows).

Anyway, as this is a common request, I wrote a guide on how to get it running, so you can just type `red` in macOS console and have Red running with access to macOS filesystem. Docker probably would be the expected solution, but Docker seems too complicated to me, so I used Multipass which took like five minutes to both install and understand.

You can hack almost anything this way. It's not something we plan to make standard in Red, but people can share their solutions. Basically you include your binary payload, write it to disk, run it, optionally delete it when your app exits. I think people did fancier things too, but don't remember the details.

@m_a_j_ch_rz_a_k_twitter I have implemented [promises](http://www.rebol.org/view-script.r?script=promises.r) in Rebol2 and I can say they are a pain to implement and to use. I must admit that even if my implementation is more feature rich than the original I haven't implemented a proper async/await pattern. All this said Instead of `promises`I would prefer that  async HTTP(S) was implemented and then, send a request by inserting it into a port, then when downloading finishes or gives an error insert an appropriate event! in the wait-list so we could do something like:
```
	on-download [...
	;or
	insert-event-func func [face event][

Elixir runs on Erlang. It's a big, complex runtime system. It used to run only on a single core but now has multiple schedulers, from a quick search. Processes are very lightweight, so not OS processes. I can't speak to the internals.

But there's concurrency, and there's CONCURRENCY. That is, there are levels of granularity, each appropriate for different needs. OS processes go a long way. Threads are helpful if you have a monilithic app and you don't want, e.g., the GUI blocked while you print a document. Then you have lightweight/green threads and co-routines (whether things are cooperative or pre-emptive), and finally ultralight process objects like Erlang with custom schedulers and a runtime to manage them. 

Do you need a hundred processes, a thousand, a hundred thousand? As you think about that, bear in mind that those processes are not all equal to each other in their richness. e.g. an Erlang process is more like a closure, not an interactive app.

For Red, the question is how best to mix and match, leveraging modern hardware effectively and easily for the user, while building on the things Red is good at.

Then you have lightweight/green threads and co-routines (whether things are cooperative or pre-emptive), and finally ultralight process objects like Erlang with custom schedulers and a runtime to manage them. 

Do you need a ten processes, a hundred, a thousand, or a hundred thousand? As you think about that, bear in mind that those processes are not all equal to each other in their richness. e.g. an Erlang process is more like a closure, not an interactive app.

For Red, the question is how best to mix and match, leveraging modern hardware effectively and easily for the user, while building on the things Red is good at.

My educated guess is that the "use the OS-provided browser backend" approach was abandoned by almost everyone 5-10 years ago. Likely reason is the amount of effort to keep the code compatible with all browsers. Which of course is the consequence of modern Browser wars.
So I should assume PC programs built on top of this crap will weigh 200MB+ (at least those I know of do). 
On Android it's the opposite, there aren't many thin apps that are just wrapped webpages, but those usually about 2-5MB (and like 10x smaller than their native counterparts). However it also looks like Android runs these apps using the default browser rather than Chrome, and you get a risk of incompatibility again, even if it's smaller there. In any case these thin apps do not include the backend (obviously) and if we want a cross platform app, we can't rely on that code ported to Android with no effort.
No idea about iOS, but since Apple would never let their users configure anything at all, my guess would be that Safari will be running the code. Which is at war with Chromium, so in the long run it will be PITA to port webapps to iOS.

I was a little snarky @Oldes, I admit, but a) you didn't answer my questions and b) you're the one who called it a cancer. ;^) Full stack means what we want it to mean. For me that's metal-to-meta. It doesn't mean *everything*, even if something is popular. 

What is the *value proposition* for this? Is it better than an in-browser solution like @ALANVF is working on? Ultimately, though, if *somebody* makes it work, and it can be included by users so it doesn't bloat Red, isn't that enough? If it has to be built into Red, because it's an embedded style of some kind, it will take a deep dev to make it an optional sub-component of View.

I don't understand what would be so wrong with having a wrapped web-view container in general. On the big scale, whatever we don't support, will eventually make ppl to consider other solutions. But - that's the life and I understand the focus of the Red team is eventually elsewhere. 
Not sure what would be the WebView good for - to display a documentation? You can run web browser externally for that. To make a browser app, using Red as a "glue"? In the long run, I wish we would get into the browser, but using some web assembly as a target.
In my opinion, Red GUI, though still might be buggy, got to some point and further than Rebol - HW accelerated, native widget for those who need this, some real life apps (View console, DiaGrammar). I am also for making it further with GOBs eventually, allowing non native GUIs, improving reactivity (Hiiamboris' reactivity related PR) etc.

@Oldes, 

I'm pretty much just looking around, trying to see if I can create a mordern-like UI with Red. Basic box shadow, rounded corners. borders, gradients. It doesn't have to be a webview, although with webview I can then use HTML, CSS, JS to do it easily.

Flutter uses skia library to render the UI. (basic hello world filesize: 20mb++)
In Rust, there's currently a UI framework called Iced that uses wgpu to render the UI. (basic hello world filesize: 10mb++)
In Red, the closest I can find If I were to do this is using base and draw everything from scratch.

I really hate electron and whatever related to it because the final file size is too big. (200mb++)

But Red really is interesting, that single executable everything, together with super small executable file. Is really triggering my excitement heheh.

@snotbubble I'm going to ask a question, and please don't think I'm attacking you in any way by asking it. Your comment of `English <> Red` prompts it.

It's true that Red has a stricter syntax than English, like a teacher rapping your knuckles with a ruler for poor grammar or punctuation. But if you look at my code examples above, for the Venn diagrams, can you make sense of them? Is it possible to glean information from them *without* knowing that they were written as Red code? If so, what are the key points of information you *do* get from them? Even without executing them in a console, can you picture what the result might be (assuming you know what a Venn diagram is)? 

Red isn't natural language, and isn't intended to be. Here's the question we (I) want to answer: is it an effective language for communication? If that's the goal (and it is) what languages do it best and what can we learn from them?

I love what Red is about. The simpler the better. Also, I don't think Red has to cover every single thing under the sun - it would be impossible to do that without becoming a giant chimera. 
I just wish that Red could just put itself out there with its flaws and everything. 1 year became 11 years and it feels like it will only be released to the world when it's perfect, but I wonder what that means and if it's a realistic goal. 
I remember that the earlier versions of Python were buggy and kinda messy, but because it put itself out there it became a topic for conversations and its community started to grow. Red kinda feels like a private club some times.
There's a lot of real world tasks that Red is more than ready to tackle already and I think a new stable version would be enough for that.
*Please, take all the above with a grain of salt as it's just my opinion.

Maybe start the Documentation by making a "wireframe", so basically collection and ordering all the needed chapters of red to get an overview.
For example use a software similar to https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ or https://docc-theme.netlify.app/docs/ and put in the chapters/structure, then work on it incrementally with most parts being TBD at first. If the documentation code is hosted on a repo then the community can chime in and help. There seem to be enough ppl around that would help here and there, but you would need to make the base.

@greggirwin First of all, I would like to note that it's very easy for outsiders to say this and that about projects which they are not directly involved in nor know the ins and outs of it. So, I would take my own words with a grain of salt. Also, I'm no community expert.

That said, I think the first contact that a lot of people have with Red is through its website (arriving from Google searches or articles around the Internet). The thing is, the first instinct for a newcomer is to try the stable version which is very outdated (released in December 7, 2018). That means that somethings don't work as expected, others are broken and even some code samples/examples don't work properly due to compatibility issues. That can be frustrating and leaves a bad first impression and may have become a gatekeeper preventing many curious people to make their way to this chat room for instance.

Beyond that, I think that the Red team should actively seek opportunities to team up with other interesting projects out there (both new and well established ones) and open up some more to interact with other communities. Also, some side projects like a Red project to teach coding could be a powerful way to spread the word (many people came to Python because it was the "easy language to learn how to code"). Those are just off the top of my head, so I'm sure that there are many more other ways to achieve that.
On a side note, I just would like to tell you how much I admire your patience and diplomacy dealing with all sorts of opinions. Kudos!

We have a number of outlines already, so we agree there. The tricky part, and this applies to Red as well as its docs, is maintaining quality and coherence while encouraging contributions. Having authored and edited (paper) books in the past, co-authors have different styles, and maintaining a consistent narrative voice is challenging. I often push to start with something we can clean up later, but that misses as often as it hits. Getting info into the wiki or later reference is the best balance I've found so far. Wikis are clearly what they are, but getting things written down at all is often the hard part, and they have a lot barrier to entry.

I absolutely hear your point. This project is your vision and this is why I think it always needs to follow your quality criteria and ideology in the end.
Maybe something like a dedicated "Community" help section / Community docs would help. So that it would clearly state is is unofficial, but still at a single place and following a certain structure. Just coming up with some ideas.

My advice is, try to attract some more linux people to give red a go. Linux severely lacks a consize GUI concept, where Windows does not really suffer from this problem.
Maybe I am making things up, but I think especially in the linux/open source GUI landscape Red might enable new concepts to design graphical user interfaces.
Still when I look at most of the examples, it seems to be centered around windows gui. This might throw some linux users off (maybe giving the impression that there is a lack of tooling or support).
Please tell me if I am totally wrong, I am fairly new here and this is my first impression :)
But think the linux (gui) sphere could tap into a lot of potential that red has to offer.
E.g. take AwesomeWm which a window manager thats controlled by Lua. It seems to have a great adoption in the linux/bsd community. Those projects mostly go viral for a reason.
A window manager/desktop written in red might find a lot of resonance.

@Nuc1eoN_gitlab if we knew why some things succeed, we would do that. :^) Unfortunately there is no answer to how you succeed as a proglang. I'd be soooo happy to be wrong about this. So what we have to do is make our best guesses about what will help, work on what we're good at, and keep plugging away until something catches fire (in a good way). And the community has to play a role. If not for @rcqls, we wouldn't have GTK. @bitbegin and @qtxie picked it up and carried it forward, and it would be done without them, but someone championed something they wanted, we saw value in it, and now we have it. 

Nix v Windows is tough. Nix is great for server side use, giving things away, and getting street cred with devs. But there's no business market there. Zero, zilch, zip, nada. Again, boy would I love to be wrong. 

And when we talk about popularity (I love being the bad guy here, not to you but to our target and goals), Rust (as an example) has been around for a decade, backed by Mozilla, and how does it compare with, say, PHP or VB in terms of popularity? Well, it sits between COBOL and Ada. This is not intended as an insult. Spread the gap wider and it's between Fortran and Logo. Elixir seemed hot for a bit, and it runs neck and neck with RPG. Do modern devs even know what RPG is? Have they ever met a green-screener?

Look at the top langs. Note the interesting mix of high and low level langs. One of my views on this is that the OS really shouldn't matter. We can say with some confidence that Windows apps needs GUIs much more than Linux apps do, in order to be successful. Most Linux deployments run on servers, by a vaaaaasssssst margin. So if we want Linux users, we should reduce pain on that side. GUIs might be nice icing, but you need a cake to put it on first. But do you know where you *must* have a GUI? Phones. How many phones are there versus Linux desktop installs? That's where we need to focus our next GUI efforts. Android.

We also need to ask why "old" langs haven't died off.  Porting is hard, expensive, and risky. While I don't want to add functions to core Red just to please devs from other langs (e.g. I've never been a fan of `unless`), I *really* want to make dialects and libs that make it easier for them to try Red, apply it where they can, and ease their pain. For that we need experts in other langs. All volunteers are welcome, just tell me what lang you know, be our (compensated) expert and how we can make Red useful to your tribe. :^)

Ultimately we need to view Red like a consumer product if we want people to use it. At the same time, if we focus *primarily* on that view, it may have shine without substance. We don't want that, because we want Red to endure.

It also missed DLL interfacing, pushing ppl not fluent with C into a plug-in dead-end.

So what is next enabler in my opinion? Please let me say it again - in my opinion. IO ports. Wouldn't ppl love to have all those protocols as an interfacing enablers? https://trello.com/c/BW1SPeOU/48-i-o-support . Being able to load libraries dynamically might help few bits too. The good thing is, that it is long time planned and hopefully comes at some point in time.

But I have even different perspective, noone mentioned yet - marketing & building the community ecosystem. I don't want to sound like a self acclaimed community coordinator, but working 4 years for Amiga Review and co-running Czech Amiga news, I know how to post news. Or I think so.

So let me just ask - how is that even possible, that Diagrammar as a big achievement, was not posted to Twitter? How is that Red FB page is frozen in 2018 with ICO related stuff? I try to at least post to FB group. Also @Oldes  mentioned it some time ago - we miss our guru here, for quite some time already. Is that a year maybe? Latest blog post? 08/2020.

I would not dare to post a blog article myself, as those are of a high standard. But I could probably get FB page going, freeing a FB group for user purposes. Such initiative should be though aligned with some Roadmap point - new web page, new release, monthly releases and all such stuff.

Interesting insight into R3 vs R2. 
Like most things, Red needs to be trusted to earn patronage, to be trusted it should be reliably, consistently useful. That means seriously addressing the wishlists of people who are busy using Red for practical commissioned work, even if the requests seem 'incorrect' (like 64-bit or FTP). Some unreasonable requests may come from clients of Red users, who have zero interest in technical reasons why they shouldn't have what they asked for... and who will shop-around.

I'd also suggest lowering the barrier-to-entry to Red by making it more forgiving to new users, especially easing up on the hard boundary between dialects and allowing instanced variables anywhere (two-way relations without react).

My impression doesn't seem to match the others :) Then all the more reason to outline it.

First, that "wonder woman" is the mascot I gather. Though I agree that those fancy pictures align with the capitalist trend of prioritizing appearances (which I clearly don't like) rather than displaying the substance. Still, I think that it may work well in the long run. 

At the core of every project is the dream. This dream is the center around which the community and it's culture revolves. By imprinting a certain aesthetic marker into people's neural networks, we can both help people connect with this dream, and improve visual recognition (e.g. you see the colors match on some tiny banner - you immediately guess the technology this project is built upon).

Whether or not the chosen mascot and the background theme aligns best with the vision of internet of open, simple, and powerful software that we, the people, are in control of - that I cannot tell. But it sure feels Rebollious, and whatever is going to be chosen, some will like it, some won't - it's a matter of tastes, but eventually people will get used to that symbol. I must say though - amazing art. @greggirwin may I ask who made the illustrations?

As to the balance of visual vs text info, tastes also vary greatly between people, because some minds are better at recognizing code samples, while other minds will panic at the sight of that. So there can be no one-size-fits-all answer here.

TBH I can't stand most of the modern sites. They prioritize appearances so much that there's no substance in them at all. It is common nowadays to see a site full of abstract images and mottos, and yet the only question I bear in mind when visiting such a site: "what the hell is this and how it may be useful *to me*?" is left unasnwered. Often I have to scroll all the way down the page thru all the marketing BS, to find a site map which will provide me with at least some hints on what this is all about. I'm glad Red beta site is not like that: every illustration is accompanied by good enough text that makes a point, and my question is answered without ever scrolling down a bit. That itself is an accomplishment.

However down the about page, what I see is this mess:
![](https://i.gyazo.com/dfdc65ead644b6602de59f23eae269a4.png)

In this matrix at least half of the statements are empty of meaning or at least will appear so to the eye of an outsider. I vote to exclude this section or make so clear that it will not look like nonsensical boasting.

Still, it's a shame that this site has been in a hidden state since 2019 and still is.

Yes, that is the one. It was the time of the Red ICO, Lucinda joining the team. She even took over the Group, but changed only the cover image IIRC. If I would be allowed to manage both, I need some advice here. Will explain shortly - we don't allow users to post to the group, without the moderation. And there are two kind of users - the ones who wrote to me privately, that if there is more than one post a day, they will leave the group, and the ones that complained to me, that we don't openly allow to post.

It could be done as other companies do it - the Page is treated as an official news feed (as we do with the Group now), whereas the Group is open to the users. But then it opens secondary channel to Gitter, and I am not sure I have enough time to provide a tech support there.

Things I'd like to see on his docs are the ability to collapse the second level in the nav area, and a light theme. If you scroll wheel in the nav pane, and it's at the bottom of the nav list already, the content scrolls. That can also be addressed.

I can't get it any faster. The problem is the timer imo. If I comment-out my `wait 0.001`in my code it flies so fast, you can't even read it. Whatever I put there to wait for, slows it down too much. IIRC you said it is related to a timer resolution?

In the first case.. you have one function, which is called in regular interval (like `on-frame`), in the second, you are waiting for events and process the event as they come... which can be extended by using the `rate` in view, which generates `on-time` events.

We don't like answering surveys, at least I don't. But we *LOVE* writing code. I recently went looking for my old permutation function, but couldn't find it. Maybe I imagined writing it, or it was so bad I destroyed the evidence. So I did a quick search or two, pulled couple books off my shelf, and realized that copying a C++ or Lisp model wasn't what I wanted to do.

I should probably have destroyed this one too. It doesn't feel particularly elegant, might be more efficient, and produces at least one bad result from the above samples. So why post it?

Because turning The Great Red Optimizer (that's you all) loose on it will surely produce a better result than I can alone, and it will be fun to watch. Go recursive, or with an interchange approach. Should we have a `next/prev--permutation` approach? The recursive model is *not* efficient. And how useful are permutations beyond a certain point? What are the use cases?

question was ambiguous, plus these priorities change from project to project.

For example: I have one project that won't finish until FTP and 64-bit MacOS is available (anti-trends), while another project has issues with cruft caused by the strict separation of dialects (mission), but both depend on easy manipulation of dates and blocks (fundamentals).

It was about my interpretation of 'fighting complexity', in short : we have to fight complexity by making complex and abstract concepts accessible with simple explanations. Pushing away the complexity behind "quirky but simple" and quick to use interfaces like we find in game engines, music production and 3d animation softwares and other doesn't fit to me at all.

And *that* comes back to the Venn diagram that started it all. A simple priority list makes us look at it one way, but the overlapping nature in the diagram is a different experience. We can't even weigh the circles by size, because each is a different axis. `Mission` is an abstract concept, about *not* adding things in our case. `Fundamentals` have concrete, durable artifacts, but still aren't bounded, except by what our mission "forces" us to include. Trends are a flowing, ephemeral river, without long term value. And we haven't even included a number of other important circles.

@hiiamboris has shown that Red can find a human minima before becoming an array language. And with a  memoizing factorial func for good measure.

I have deep respect for those who can write in APLs, and even more if they can read them too. ;^)

Total agreement here that `also` is a brilliant func. That said, I would probably not put @hiiamboris code into production the way it's used here. Not without reformatting and comments for clarity. 

I have a number of things on my list for today, and setting up profiling for the various submissions will take a little time. If someone else wants to do that, go for it.

As a funny side note, @hiiamboris saves a few bytes here `also r: make [] n: fac length? a` by using `make []` rather than `make block!`. I recently brought this up with Nenad. I couldn't find any code using that patter, but didn't go through Boris' gitlab repos. I want to consider `make` with a prototype block or map work like it does with objects. That is, include the prototype data. Blocks raise questions because they're not key-val structures, and what to do if the spec is an integer, but if we doc the behavior, we can choose the most useful and keep it simple. This would give us more consistency and make it much easier to use the different types in data files. This ties to a couple existing tickets, and came from a real-world use case.

`make proto-map partial-map`, where `partial-map` is a record in a file. `proto-map` has more fields that the app uses, like a schema. We can look at this a lot of ways. e.g. maps will add new keys as needed, so why use a prototype? Sometimes you want flexibility, but a fully spec'd structure is its own documentation. Partials in files "leaks" less info, where users don't need to care about it. So it comes down to context as well. If maps copied strings, I might never have brought it up. :^)

It's also interesting to think in terms of what the type choice says to intent. Objects say "code + data", Maps, say "key-val data", and blocks say...could be anything, what does it look like? If it looks like key-val and walks and talks like key-val, it probably is. Of course, you can't `parse` objects or maps, so it's not like they are all transparently interchangeable.

@hiiamboris you have `map-each/only`. In mine I always use `/only` internally, which I decided to do based on the result matching the number of values being mapped.

@hiiamboris ah, map. :^\ Thanks.

@GalenIvanov :^). I have this conflict in my brain at times. I'm a K fan, and think Arthur Whitney is an amazing developer and designer. What you can do with human code compression astounds me. And I *want* to do it soooo badly. Like I wanted to do Lisp many years ago. I've tried both, and others like Smalltalk, but some things just don't click in my head. 

An important point we don't talk about much in programming is *writing for your audience*. DSLs are about as close as we come. Hemingway isn't better than Wilde or Tolstoy, and CS textbooks aren't better than romance novels. Look at the power of sequels and now serial blockbusters or horror films. People come in with context, and studios know there's an audience. 

But with proglangs, while we have genres (imperative, FP, OO, symbolic, logic, stack-based, etc.), we only have a few directors for each one. In this analogy, I suppose the big players like FAANG are like A List celebrities.

It's Rebol with JSON object parens. I like the absence of the make constructor, but can't decide on counting starting from zero. Also, paths are of two types, dotted and slashed, I think because this let you distinguish between selection and execution at path level. Carl wants to attract the huge json/Javascript coders world masking Rebol inside something they are used to see.

Carl is a man of ideas and visions. I share with him this trait. This kind of mind tends to enter in creative states where you end up with projects and the day to day activities blocks your from realizing them, so you announce the project but life block you from realizing it. In fact, if you read carefully the blog article, he admits it is suffering about this problem. Please remember when Carl has started Rebol, he created and lived with Rebol Tech, he was fully involved with it: life,  work, projects, family, ideas, all were in the same dimension.  When your work is at Roku and visions have just your spare time to be realized,  you end up thinking you can do something when really you can't do it. So you announce you will make <a project>, you believe you can, you even evaluate you have the time but really you don't have it. it's a psychological mechanism where the evaluation process of the available resources returns the result needed to achieve the dream and not the real one. In other words, the mind tends to tell us lies and create a fake answer to realize something and we believe in it. Consider it a kind of hypnosis/trap!  What I really see is the suffering of a creative visionary caged in his day-to-day life.  Something we all, as humans, face in our existence.

'I can't believe you were not aware of this new project from Carl.'

:)

Many years before REBOL (late 80s), I created a brutally simple language called MIDAS (Machine Independent Demo and Animation System, amazingly it was not a backronym), it of course produced .GOLD files.

These were P-code files that would then be converted to ML almost directly.

I designed it working backwards from 6502, 68000, etc.

REBOL shares a few similarities with MIDAS in that as OPPOSED to trying to build a language that is as base or core as possible, instead of building a language that 'knows' structures' and has key commands that we all know everyone needs and wants (normally those are religated to libraries or add ons).

Since I was focused on the flow of entertainment products, we had commands (and what might be thought of as a dialect) for things like INPUT, where a mouse or a joystick could give us Up, Down, Left, Right, and Fire Button(s), etc.

Carl and I of course talked about this even very early on.

it was super easy to write programs that controlled the flow of a game.  

- Start up showing images, allow people to click past them (titles, credits, help, etc)
- Select 1 player, 2 player, view Score card
- Start a game
- End a game

Write once, play many.

So with this, the whole game's logic instantly worked on C64, Apple II, Amiga, IBM-PC, Mac, etc.
At that time in history, that saved a LOT of time and money.

Should `ref!` values `form` with their sigil included? My gut says yes. That's the human friendly form. 

However, that also raises the question for `issue!`. When Rebol was created, there was no such word, and issues were for serial numbers and such (also were string based in R2 for those who don't know). The name "hashtag" came about in 2007 (per wikipedia), so a decade after Rebol's release. The question is whether they are so common now, and recognized by a wide audience, that their natural form includes the sigil. My gut says yes. That will eliminate a lot of `mold` calls for people looking for hashtags in texts, and it likely the far more common case. To omit the sigil, `to string!` is still the base converter. 

We need to add `ref!` to https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BDOC%5D-Table-for-to-string-etc., but that table is valuable for discussions like this.

Let's tackle them separately. How we render "atomic" lexical values is different from how we render aggregate values. Strict consistency can also play against usability. It's about what the most useful rendering is for how things are used, and what options we have. e.g. `to string!` is the most rudimentary, then `form`, then `mold`. `Form` is expected to be a lossy operation in some cases.

What we have to balance is the usability of each rendering, while not making them all the same when the differences are useful. 

I'll say -1 for `/sigil`, because that's what `mold` is for.

To be honest, porting to Red would be wasting of my time as I don't believe such a huge change would be ever accepted (I bet than Nenad have own plans how it should look like). Porting to R3 is a good test case for R3 itself as there is not a more complex Rebol code than Red compiler.

Thanks for the R&D @Oldes! If it hadn't already been pretty much set in stone, I would have kept issue as a string. Not sure if I'd want ref to be a word. That's one of the few breaking changes I think was a mistake. Carl, AFAIK, didn't ask or analyze, but made the case based on his own use of issues as keywords. Even there it's simply an optimization. I used them for all kinds of things, including GUIDs, record IDs, phone numbers, and hashtags. But that's water under the bridge.

Another interesting obstacle is that in R2 there is: `round/ceiling  1.2` resulting to integer, while in R3 and Red it is still decimal.

As first element of path mostly is special (function, object, map, block...) IMO it is justified to treat it differently from other series. It is non-special only if you treat it as a block of values, and then you can do weird things with it (e.g. `as path! [1 a %c] ;== 1/a/%c`).

While I've nothing against paths being swappable, and leaving sanity checking to user, I still think first element in path is special in much more fundamental way. While any char that **can** be in first position in tag is just as any other char in tag, first element in path is same as others only exceptionally. Path is hierarchical series and this makes it different.

OK then, why didn't we join an R3 or other Redbol project? We can be similar but not the same. And while we want to be self-hosting, few other languages do. Arturo is written in Nim, and has an internal VM and bytecode compiler, so while the syntax may look similar in *some* cases, it's actually quite different. In some ways it is very much a Redbol language, but in others (math precedence for example). And the syntax is far enough from Redbol langs that porting code will be a bit more work. I don't know if Arturo is, or aims to be, homoiconic, but that's another possible difference.

I hope we can all learn from each other, taking the best of what we learn from each project and language, to improve software development for everyone.

Hello, crew.

So, my ex asked me to create an archive copy of an email account.  I bragged about setting up a few lines of REBOL or Red.  Umm, now I find out I'm old and can't remember things.  Setting up popspec.r and mailsave justs spins on the connection.  So, I'm missing a critical bit or newness that probably happened in the last 11 years or so that is blocking simple REBOL access?  Or is it deeper?  Should I focus on learning more Red? (i.e. can Red handle POP3 and IMAP protocols yet?)

@greggirwin @GiuseppeChillemi @pekr First of all, thanks a lot for all the kinds words.

Trying to avoid to over-pollute the Red community with something not-so-relevant, I believe I owe an answer. I think the answer - or at least mine - to the rather common question "why another language?" is that none of what already exists seems to cover what you are looking for, so... you set off to build it yourself. (usually failing, rarely succeeding). And for me, that's how things in general improve: the more ideas around, the better (think of it: it's impressive how, even projects that didn't have much success themselves, may have in turn influenced immensely other projects - and I'm not even talking just about software - that turned out to be far more popular or significant). So... I'd stick to that. The more ideas moving around freely, the better. I don't see it as competition. I never did. It's just (slightly or not-so-slightly) different approaches to the same problems. And everyone benefits in the end. Ì†ΩÌ∏â

A fairly low cost way to Javascript in Red is to link in Duktape, or Jsish, or gjs, or...

Once you have the C ABI, *you have* the C ABI, all of it.  These layers can be thin.  Like Duktape, Fabrice Bellard has a one file QuickJS now, a little bit of boilerplate, and Red to Quick embedded and back, in a page of code-ish.  Then just let people script any js that might be needed (with args) and set a Red word/block on the way out.

Ok, close(r). TM.  Ì†ΩÌ∏â  Orders of magnitude slower than what real Red will be, but yeah.

Opinions.  A humanities loader:  Take start pos, to (not thru) error pos, make it text! (or a blockable/testable junk form), add error character as the text!/junk trigger, as a character or testable/blockable value. Continue loading, however borked a cascade error may cause.

The current load-trap can almost load COBOL sources, but trips on commas to end of string, instead of going non-greedy. 

Again, not a programmer thought process, a humanities brain, looking for patterns, and not knowing what that may look like until hinted at by trial results.  If an end of line full stop cause the loader to mistake different COBOL semantics, i.e. if`01 datafield PIC 999 value 8.` causes the last two COBOL tokens to look like a float, and not just an integer followed by a full stop; DO NOT CARE about lexical/semanitic purity.

The humanities loader is not a COBOL language loader, but it can load COBOL.  It can also load a book text, as say Latex, or a genome dump (with page headers, the odd sidebar comment - etc), and be 98% combat effective.  Perfect for humanities level analytics.  Not running airplanes in Humanities Loader mode.  Just getting data into block form with all the awesome Set theory words and PARSE powers.  Analysts can refine things through console exploration and fine tune inputs when it comes time to publish and defend the thesis.

All the other data science tools pretty much limit base types to numbers and strings, and strings need quoting.  REBOL/Red opens up so many more base types that it could cover more data in the data science, but for a junk! type to make loading easier on the non-programmer.

@greggirwin   Yeah, me neither.   Oh well, called that a failed experiment.  Same old argument I've been giving for opening a potential non-programmer LOAD power.  And with a non-pure data fallback, it would be possible to write things like a command based line editor in Red that allowed for Red scripting.   A DSL that would allow a Red console user to not worry about mental swaps from Language to Editor and back to Language, as the Editor would be part of the Language.  No worries for now.  Will await the next cut and see if LOAD/TRAP comes back.

Yep.  But a generalized LOAD/ANY with a fallback token capture would make it so much easier, and likely orders of magnitude faster.  I keep picking use case examples that may not make all that much sense to a programmer.   Imagine a data source, with a teenie bit of out-of-band data, say a stray comma.  As is, REBOL and Red LOAD are either 100% combat effective, or 0%.  First bit of bad news, and the data source becomes useless for blocking.  In code that make sense, be clean or fail the load.  With data as data, who cares if 8 tokens out of 100,000 are not clean.  Those exceptions can be flagged, and the user still gets all the Red powers of block! parse and all the nifty set theory words.  Again, LOAD/ANY is not for code, but for data analysis.  Sitting at a console pondering, and refining.    In a editor example, the non-pure loadables are just string!.  In a genome project, non-pure word! data might be utterly ignorable (say ISBN numbers, or page markers that snuck into the data source). Easy to track, as a block! scanner word could just highlight all the non-pure items.  As is, that data source would be limited to string! parse (or require upfront massage), which is far less powerful than getting a block of data with little bits of untyped tokens intermixed.

As a programmer, yes.  Hand those same problems to an Engineer or Office Worker, and they get 0% combat effective LOAD.  So, they use Python data science tools instead.  Far less powerful, but they don't need to program around junk, as they only get string or number types to start with.

Brian... I don't mean to condescend, but I'm *telling* you, than you can't generalize.

If you find a non-valid character, what do you do? Is just that character an invalid token? If not, where does the invalid token end? Space? Newline? Every single use case will have a *different* answer to these questions.

I strongly suggest using `parse` for this kind of problems. If it's as easy as you say in your specific case, then writing a `parse` rule should be very easy as well.

Otherwise, Red already gives you a lot of flexibility on loading, so if your use case is indeed easy there's nothing stopping you.

[18:53:49](#QmIXp4eiJ8lA3nXjNlxj6xcdxHKvBhEa0x1sKW1-9_0) <btiffin (Brian Tiffin)>:
Hmm, the general rule.  From last pos to the character that causes a trip up.  As LOAD/TRAP is advertised as doing/will do/maybe depending on next cut decisions.  From last pos to trigger char, appends to block! as text! data, skip over the trigger char, append the char as text!.  Continue loading.  No lookahead.  text! would come in pairs except perhaps at BEGIN and END.  First text! maybe attempt to resolve with another load, maybe not, depending on user need for clean.  I think that would cover most data-as-data loading.

[18:58:40](#XjhbcwxeHMS36Djn-3dhr_G_VnZwT-nRNMywiRKoAfI) <btiffin (Brian Tiffin)>:
Let the user then decide if the block! needs more work.  It might already be good enough.  And it's in block! form, which would allow for easier and somewhat lackadaisical pondering at the console.  And yes, a Genome project may add a post processing layer, and Programming Language analysts could and a different post processing layer, but let LOAD get the initial data source into blocks.

And yeah, sorry Gabriele, it's been years.  My bad.  I've been poking my head in, for a few days, raising the issue, then disappearing again for months and months.  I haven't put in the work.  Apologies for that.  And I'll admit to being gone long enough that Red, like all feature dense small packages, is a bit overwhelming, wanting to know it all at once, makes for a little bit of flailing.

You don't need to apologize - all I'm trying to say is that what you describe is not *general*. 

Look at even this very very simple example:
```
>> transcode/trace "a ,b c" func [event input type line token] [?? event ?? input ?? type ?? line ?? token true]
event: prescan
input: " ,b c"
type: word!
line: 1
token: 1x2
event: scan
input: " ,b c"
type: word!
line: 1
token: 1x2
event: load
input: " ,b c"
type: word!
line: 1
token: a
event: prescan
input: ",b c"
type: error!
line: 1
token: 3x3
event: error
input: ",b c"
type: error!
line: 1
token: 3x3
```

Red found a `","` which is a syntax error. Now what? Skip just the comma? Skip up to the space? Skip to the end? When does it start trying to `load` again? There is no *general* answer to this question. Maybe there's one that works for you, but hardly for others.

I don't know the details of how `transcode` works, but others here do and can help you make it do what you need for your special case.

There's a wrinkle, because removing from a map requires `/key` and the key as an argument for that refinement. Adding `map!` support to `foreach` meant enforcing the `word` arg to be a block of two values. We would have to do the same for `remove-each`,  and then use the word the user chose as the `key` reference implicitly. Or do something more involved.

`wait` actually waits for all. this is a simple test that opens a client, connects to server waits for reply, closes a nd then repeats. It does not open clients simultaneosly, I believe you would need to run multiple clints. However the server should accept multiple clients from what I've tested.

@m_a_j_ch_rz_a_k_twitter not sure what you mean by one wait for the 500 clients, but you can certainly do it. In Redbol, `wait`waits for multiple things - ports, time. It returns, what happen first. So basically the way to go is to `wait [0.001 port-list]`, which will release your loop each 0.001 sec, or, if any of ports in the `port-list`(block of waiting ports) has some event ....

@rebolek thanks for your feedback. The script does not change the default font, nor use any default settings for that. It just plays with the font-size. You may change the font globally however by changing : system/view/fonts/system with the intended font-name. 
When choosing the font, one problem is that the script uses some extented characters that work fine on windows with Segoe UI but maybe not that fine with other default fonts. In particular, I had issuses with the underscripted h for hyperbolic functions, and the characters used for ceil and floor operations. I might just get rid of these to give more freedom in the choosing of a font.
If you find a suitable font on Linux, let me know. In any case, I will probably add the ability the font to use as well as the base font size as an option.

Also, supporting `escape` to close those would be nice.

I register your remark on the button for closing the popups, and for adding the support for the escape key. Maybe also provide the ability to click outside of the window as this is the intention of this application to be used with a mouse or a finger. For the closing button, it is the standard character in windows, but I should use a different one. That would prevent any confusion, either mac or android. They are well-known conventions also.

Parens in Red denote a "hot value" which is evaluated. `lit-paren!` is a fine name, as a parallel to `lit-path!`,   but we have to draw a line somewhere. e.g. what would a `get-paren!` mean? But since we already have a value that represents what you want, why not use that? Of course, this is all part of exploring and balancing the core language and what it lets you create. Constraints can be very helpful. e.g., you're using path notation, but if you described your dialect, what are the key elements and actions?

I assume you've considered them already, but we don't know what they are in detail. So our recommendations may not match your needs and goals. From what *I* know, you want a mix of declarative, keyed access and offset navigation. But I *don't* know if keys can be dynamic, if you need more than +/- offsets, etc.

It's interesting, because we tend to normalize data structures for access *either* by key or fixed size, but when they are mixed we call it "semi structured" data, which has historically been a challenge to deal with because the "semi" part makes it a bit squishy and easier to get wrong...sometimes, or over time.

@greggirwin I have read again my last year's notes and your replies. You are right, many things have to be considered but I think parens are not a good solution. The current working must be maintained, we should just change the path segment operation to skip using some symbol and maintain the current mechanism. Let's made the hypothesis we choose `>>` or `>` as `skip`

This skips 2 positions on the right
`word/>>2/word2`
This skips 4 positions on the left
`word/>>-4/word2`
as before but gets the gets the number from :value
`word/>>:value/word` 
as before but gets the gets the number from the resulting of (code)
`word/>>(code)/word` 

But we can just go further. 
Paths navigate through series and we have another great Red tool to navigate through them:  PARSE! Why don't we use it?
Please take a look at this path:

`word/<:[skip 2 to word! skip thru 'section-start  <:]/word`

If a path segment has `<:[]` then the current path series position is passed to PARSE. While parsing,  each time you encounter `<:` the path current series position is changed to the parse one. If parse fails, the path fails and it returns `none`.
(Conceptually this last solution seems so easy and straightforward)

About skipping, when you have 2 sequential data sections  like `[Id <object> "section2" id 33] ` parts and similar names, let you express  the elements after object in one path selection, without using blocks and reusing the same words: `word/>>3/id` returns 33. Excessive nesting is sometime also a problem and not all structures are better when nested, sometime they are better when expressed linearly...

With TO shifting you can have variable data length on the first segment of data and in the second  just with `word/>>object!/>>id`. With this syntax a full horizontal navigation is possible in just one line.

For those wondering why Windows is faster than Mac OS, i have noticed this performance difference many times, as i run Windows and Linux under OSX via VMware Fusion. One massive difference between Windows and OSX is that Windows has a much faster file system, with read ahead and caching, and OSX is rather dumb in this area. So anything that involves reading data is going to be noticeably faster in Windows, and since Windows will keep a file in RAM even after you have closed the file (on the off-chance that it might be used again), second and later runs of the same program on Windows tend to be rather quick.  In general the I/O on OSX is slow.  This may be unrelated to why redCV has a performance difference, but there is no cleaner comparison than the same exact hardware!

Everyone I hear using the M1 are a bit shocked at how fast it is, even on a Mac that only has 8 GB RAM. The key to the design is very wide memory buses and of course having all the memory right on the main chip. Also, each CPU core can saturate the memory controller that can handle around 60-70 GB/s. An intel/AMD CPU core can only do 15-25 GB/s. That's pretty astounding.

Then of course is the low TDP of less than 30 W can make it do long running tasks with little cooling needed. The GPU isn't very powerful though. The cost is also presently only a maximum of 16 GB RAM.

What is even more interesting is that Mx series CPUs will grow much faster in the near future, if Apple's CPU speed ramp will be maintained from the earlier Ax CPUs. There's lots of low-hanging fruit left for Apple to pick.

Intel should worry for many other reasons, since they squandered their position for 7-8 years now. So far behind AMD now.

Intel has lost the entire Apple account, which was probably at least 5% of Intel's total business. So it's a big loss. They have been idling for years they didn't have any serious competition. Intel still has the best Quantum Physicists on the planet, and they are only one invention away from blowing away the world again.  We are in the plateau region of the development curve, where almost nothing changes. If you put more than 10 cores in a chip you don't get much useful work out of it, so we are flattening out everywhere in the computer biz.

We have still a large margin of improvement in software. Algorithms are tuned for single processor tasks. Once they will move to multi-core operations we will see again a lot of improvements.

@GalenIvanov sorting and pulling a value doesn't match the behavior. `maximum/minimum-of` in R2 are not great names, because they return the series offset, not the value. I proposed either `at-max` or `find-max` in the past. But they also need design input. e.g. what are they used for, is `/case` worth supporting, or even `/skip`? And if you need this behavior, is it better to do it with an aggregator, because a linear search is not efficient. No big deal if your data is small or the query infrequent, but finding the maximum *feels* more like something you need in larger data analysis scenarios, where it can add value. e.g. graphing data and setting chart bounds.

[15:08:59](#apm2IjYjOmgf0dziSWeRSCZwJjhoFIodjcw8hh0-DQo) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:

When code is data and data is code, sometimes you can't distinguish a situation from a value:

```
>> a: [b c #[none!]] 
probe type? probe pick a 3 
probe type? probe pick a 10
none
none!
none
none!
```

`None` is returned either as an element picked from a block and when we are out of the boundaries. 
In any function of this kind, you have to create another one to check if we are in a situation that returns `None`.

There have been a couple reasons, one is logistics and the other is content (.e.g porting the old blog to it). We also have https://progress.red-lang.org/, though that's not helpful for newcomers. One of the main things that needs work is consolidating the matrix on https://beta.red-lang.org/about/ and then creating pages for those entries. The latter can happen over time.

Here's what I posted about it:

We leverage polymorphism with prototypes and datatypes, but they are very different things. One is specific, the other generic. By not using a datatype! when they can be used (because you don't need prototype based semantics) you're throwing away the leverage that their meaning provides. Using it generally will also fall prey to the fact that to/make and as are different beasts, the latter being much more limited. I also don't think it's "the name of the thing" which would be a word referring to it. Datatypes are a meaningful metadata classifier.

The least offensive types are probably empty blocks and strings/tags. Beyond that, it gets ugly and confusing IMO. In some cases it plain won't work, e.g. parens. So the few cases that work acceptably are exceptions, and you're exploiting a loophole in the design. ;^)

I used Hungarian Notation a *lot* in the 90s. If you only have 6 types, starting with unique letters, it works much better than it would in Red. Also why you end up with things like `sz` as prefixes for "C string", because that makes sense. Well, it does if you're a C programmer. But it's also onerous to maintain, and often hints at leaking details through large systems. If you have a rich, strong type system, it's less helpful.

[19:39:35](#ZGm6SYiy9p1uOMjPx1jEpATDiFu59dtb0ZT1PnAaDUM) <hiiamboris (NOT THIS ONE)>:
We were discussing string interpolation with Gregg, and would like others input.

Preliminary design was `#composite` macro and `composite` function. Both are described [here](https://gitlab.com/hiiamboris/red-mezz-warehouse/-/blob/master/composite.md), but TL;DR is `#composite` turns a string into a `rejoin` with block and `composite` does it internally and returns rejoined string:
```
>> probe expand-directives [#composite {"(player)" "(vfile)" --audio-file "(afile)"}]
[rejoin [{"} (player) {" "} (vfile) {" --audio-file "} (afile) {"}]]
```
The latter as you can see gets very ugly at times. So first purpose of it is **readability**. Second purpose is **localization** \(see [on the same page](https://gitlab.com/hiiamboris/red-mezz-warehouse/-/blob/master/composite.md#localization)\).

There are however some issues.

- `#composite` is a long thing to type. I found myself writing macro wrappers around it: `#print` for `print #composite`, `ERROR` for `do make error! #composite` and so on.
- `#composite` can't accept strings indirectly (being a macro), e.g. strings conditionally fetched or built at runtime.
- `composite` (func) requires runtime binding, and that we provide it every time (see the above page for details). Which is a bag of gotchas for everyone not deeply familiar with Red.
- What escape syntax should be preferred? Current implementation uses `(\` to denote literal `(`, which is backwards ‚òª

My stats so far are:
- `ERROR` is a very common use case, probably 50-70% of my use of composite.
- `#print` is most of the rest.
- other `#composite` uses are present (e.g. composing file content) but not very numerous.
- `composite` (function) I only used once.

Some recent ideas:
- Replace `#composite "value=(v)"` with a shorter macro, e.g. `` `"value=(v)"` ``. Backtick does not stick to strings and tags, but stick to files and raw-strings (though it can be fixed). No need for wrappers anymore. Such triple quotes are harder to count visually though.
- Most languages [reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_interpolation#Examples) some quotation format for this (very common) use. We could code backticks directly in the lexer to transform strings like `` `value=(v)` `` into `rejoin ["value=" (v)]` (or just into blocks?) *on load*. That however harms localization, as we don't get the string form anymore and need some kludges to extract it.
- We can build and expand macros at runtime as shown above, so there really is no strict need for `composite` function and we may even abandon it, or make it a wrapper around the macro: build the macro pattern, expand, bind and evaluate.

What do you guys think? Any ideas on how to best support interpolation? Have you used it (or wanted to use) in your code?

If you have another set of delimiters, whether because you prefer them, have legacy data you're porting, or need to handle templates from multiple sources, you'll wrap those calls. It does raise the question of a leading but no trailing sigil. e.g. `$var`, but I suppose space is the trailing mark then. Trickier to get formatting right then, as you'd need 2 to keep a space there. Ick.

[19:59:15](#Rzx4G7r_3nJlkyngPLYd-qJrKU9CWILGHEJRVVSxTkY) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
@gtzip the question of value in Red is a good one. We tend to think in terms of little strings, and bits of code we `compose` or `rejoin`. While we don't have measurements, we do have evidence that non-developers understand, and can effectively use, templates (e.g. mail merge). Where blocks of code are normal for us, they are foreign to others, flipping the model on its head. No longer are there placeholders within a string of text, but there are interspersed *bits* of text and expressions. In my own work, I've used external templates more than internal, not counting `rejoin/reform` cases where devs are the only consumer.

I also noted to @hiiamboris that a key elements is the WYSIWYG aspect. `Rejoin/reform` make you look at *every* text snippet to make sure you have leading trailing spaces right. That's probably one of my most common mistakes in formatting. The other place that's huge is in multiline string formatting. e.g. templated email bodies. Compare this R2 `build-markup` example
```
        body {
            The <%PROCESS_NAME%> process sent DISKPART the following commands:
            
                <%mold MARKUP_1%>

            The DISKPART result was:
                            
                <%mold MARKUP_2%>
        }
```
with something like
```
        body [
            "The " <%PROCESS_NAME%> " process sent DISKPART the following commands:^/^/"
            
            tab   <%mold MARKUP_1%>

            "^/^/The DISKPART result was:^/^/"
                            
            tab    <%mold MARKUP_2%>
        ]
```
We can put the former in a user's hands, and if errors aren't dangerous, e.g. malformed fields, they can still deal with it. The latter, based on my experience, is *not* user friendly. It can be especially confusing because the blank lines in the template do *not* affect the output.

I can add that first time I saw Gregg's `#composite` my reaction was "why would we ever want that?". But then with every `print` or `rejoin` I was using in my code I had this thought "what if..". Then I started using my experimental implementation, and after some time I believe it's a total must have.

[20:41:58](#EKuX-g5zfmIkbkMcIGOYx32fkHKU5EHAMD-SxlbQdKo) <zentrog>:
I think this Red version is a little closer to the R2 example

                } mold MARKUP_2 {
        }]

If it's a macro, I don't mind it looking like one, with a leading `#` sigil. The editorial "change/insert" mark is `^`, which is a problem in Red.  `#^^` seems...icky `~` is close to "transpose", but that meaning isn't a great match for "substitute".

I still like aspects of the backtick, but #\` is pretty subtle. #\`\` less so. 

The number of bracketed string types in Red makes the other options quite ugly. As a more traditional macro it could also work for composing blocks at compile time. More thought required.

The worst-looking syntax with leading/trailing backticks is for regular strings, which are likely the most common case.

Using a refinement to make it remote seems to be the complicating factor. As far as you're concerned, a call is complete (`command/ref arg1 arg2 refarg1`), correct? So you can store that internally as a block, and make the remote part separate if it's used.

my-call: [command/ref arg1 arg2 refarg1]

* @greggirwin Another option to transfer the current function context words and refinements and the values, is to use the `set` syntax. It is perfect for keeping trace of refinements:

```
ctx: [[a b c /red ref-arg] [a b c false false]] 
```

You have just to convert `/red` to word before executing `set`

When `words-of` and `values-of` will be implemented for function it will be easy to write

```
ctx: reduce [words-of context? 'ref values-of context? 'ref]
```

Also `set` words argument could accept refinements, so you can simply write: 
```
set ctx/1 ctx/2
```

The new `try/keep` feature is there now, for including stack traces, but we don't know if it should be the default.

For those more versed in Java and Haskell, the two approaches are very similar, aren't they? You have to declare all the specific exception/error types that can occur, and then you need to specifically handle each one of them.

It's an age-old question, without a single answer that is right for every situation. Treating errors symbolically moves toward general symbolic computing, which Red is well suited for.

@kskarthik:poddery.com that certainly would be :-) Current Red‚Äôs IO is pretty limited, you can do requests and not serve anything, however, there‚Äôs IO branch with the new IO which can do both and you can write a HTTP server with it.

@dockimbel noted [here](https://github.com/red/red/issues/3528) that path's higher overhead is a primary reason they aren't supported. However, if you don't use paths and aren't penalized, I don't see why those who want to use them shouldn't be allowed to. As long as they don't complain about performance. If there's no wish ticket for that, feel free to open one.

The ultimate defense is simplicity. As "stacking compose" I mean the code practice where you nest multiple compose calls, which can be generalized as "the code practice where you have to transform the block of code multiple times under compose/reshape like functions".  This forces you to keep in mind the reshaping/transformation mechanism of the functions you are using for this purpose; multiple meta states of the code block; the relevant elements; the final version of the code and where it will interact. *Paths are simply, visible, straightforward with no layer of complications: what you see is what you manage.*
The second side defense is @greggirwin one: if you have heavy overhead only when using them, well it's your choice as no one will have penalties for these features.

Naturally `parse` needs to check for the new datatype as well, which adds to this. And this is just reading the value, not setting it. But if the user isn't paying the cost when the feature isn't used, this seems like a useful way to modularize rules. Of course, creating "modules" of common rules, assuming people use them, means many people are paying that price for common rules.

The problem I see is that this particular change is based on incorrect language interpretation. In this context `master` is not a noun, it's an adjective meaning "original" or "primary". Could we also use one of those words? Sure. We used to call the main branch `trunk`, which is great when working with metaphorical branches. Though the analogy breaks down because branches don't naturally grow back into a trunk. But in the days of DVCS, are we still holding on to old notions beyond their time? I ask this for a reason, imagining distributed system models, but don't have an answer, linguistically or technically.

@greggirwin Master is the element used to create all the other copies. In history we had master tape recordings, video... . I still remember having read that Ray Charles was the first black artist who owned his song masters. So, losing Master as word, Github looses one of the most important words which rapresent black people success and liberation.

Politics and wokeness is getting into everything. I agree that we should try to not offend people, but sometimes woke people try to protect other people even when they don't feel they need it. My father was an actual slave the first half of his life, was discriminated against, beaten, and treated very poorly. I never thought to be offended by the terms Master and slave. They are an accurate description. But somehow people whose ancestors were slaves many generations ago are offended by it?

You can't control what git and github decide to do, and we do want to be non-offensive when possible, but master has so many other meanings besides slavery. My ancestors were slaves. My grandfather had to flee his hometown to escape a lynch mob.

There is nothing in a 'master' branch that reminds me of slavery. A master is the original, from which all others are copied.

I hope we can move on and stop obsessing about non-issues like this.

@greggirwin
(coming from red/help)

I made a few more tweaks to https://github.com/red/red/wiki/Coming-to-Red-from-Python. The last paragraph in the context section is great, whoever wrote that. It distills things very well IMO.

@gltewalt:matrix.org recently noted that we never played up the power of libRed after showing the really cool Excel demo Nenad did. I agree that we should, and do some that are more practical. If we have any Excel users who want to pursue that, we'll advise and sponsor the work.

I also think that could be really cool for Python, given the new intros we have. If Pythonistas face some pain that Red could help address, libRed may be the most effective way for them to do it. Just as Red/System can be applied in a targeted fashion. Examples would be parsing or GUIs, but maybe also config files. I recently dusted off some old config lib code and notes and want to see that built in (after HOFs and CLI). It's a near-universal need, and one I think Red can serve better than JSON, YAML, TOML, EDN, INI, and others. 

Configurations tie to more than just local files though. I put them in a "hierarchical environments" category. What I mean by that is starting with a template or skeleton and overlaying or extending it with "more local" information. Very much like scoping.

Many features intersect, which makes the design challenging. Lock one thing down tight and it makes other things harder to do. Like tightening bolts a little bit each, adjusting as you go, until the thing you're bolting down (the design) is lined up so it doesn't cause any of the bolts to bind.
Another way to approach this is via abstraction and interfaces, letting you build plug-in systems. We need a balance, and choosing each approach appropriately. And just because Red offers a tightly integrated solution doesn't mean people can't write other plug-in based models themselves. Our solutions won't serve everyone's needs or solve every possible problem. That's not the goal, which is good because it's unattainable. :^)

I was recently going to point @GalenIvanov  to https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/ownership.adoc for how ownership works, but found that the example there (from the original blog post about it) no longer works. I just spent a few minutes banging on it, having not touched ownership myself for a long time, and it's behavior is not intuitive to me. i.e., my quick hacks didn't work.

I know @hiiamboris has done quite a bit with it, and opened a number of related tickets, but he's quite busy. Would someone like to play with ownership, documenting its current behavior in detail, with examples, on a new wiki page? From there we can update docs. Others of us can help and test, and maybe @hiiamboris can do a quick primer to help us ramp up.

We will sponsor this work. It's a powerful feature, but needs more people using it to move the design and ticket processing forward. Noting tickets, limitations, and workarounds should also be a part of this.

probe append numbers/list 1
probe insert next numbers/list 8
probe poke numbers/list 1 4

It's not obvious when/how/what to do in response to events to force changes. e.g. `append` isn't a "pre" event that you can cancel, which is the intuitive meaning in my mind.

The Apple M1 chip will be soon replaced by the much nicer M2 chip. The M1 was just their first try at making their own silicon. Not a very pretty situation as they haven't documented it that thoroughly. I expect the M2 to be their workhorse chip for most of their line.  But i expect it to ship early next year. That will be the ideal mac target. The M1 chip will likely be one of those orphaned mac products, as Apple is fairly ruthless about forcing people to upgrade.  They just added 3000 engineers to the Berlin campus, where the chip is developed. That's a lot of people to hire in one year.

Ownership does sound interesting, but I don't think I could commit enough time to it right now. I was curious if there are some high-level design goals for it, besides just "support for reactivity", or was that the entire goal? The request sounds a bit like defining it through reverse engineering

[19:16:48](#rsSqxi0c_hux_ibh71qm6CifciG2CSbbOAV6NOa8cqo) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
"Reactivity" is a general term, but what features like this enable go by many names: eventing, flow-based, and instrumented being a few. It also offers a data-oriented spin on FRP. With FRP everything channels through functions, with data as the payload. With DRP (Data Reactive Programming) that view pivots. Maybe it does anyway. I don't know...yet. It hasn't been outside the known context(s) that justified it. Combine ownership with reactivity and what does a "spreadsheet cell" look like as a deep reactor? Or maybe an object can track its change history, which could be used for debugging, auditing, and live system version control. If it persists its history, now you're looking down the Alan Kay Croquet alley.

But to start with, how does it work now? Is it easy to understand by someone other than the author? Does it have limitations we need to address before using it more widely? What other types can and should be "owned"? Certainly maps come to mind, and probably other objects. But is the latter the purview of ownership, or is that where the reactive system comes into play? So this task is a combination of exploration, explanation, and extrapolation.

Here's a thought along these lines, but of lower level.

Our interpreter reinterprets every block every time as if it may have changed. If loop evaluates it's body 1M times, we pay for 1M evaluations, even though I've never seen anyone modifying loop's body from the loop itself.

If we could track changes of words values/context back to the body block, and if interpreter could cache each function/op call in the block, and invalidate this cache on change, we could save the interpretation cost of each loop and function.

This would be like JIT-compilation but more flexible as it would allow you to change the code.

[20:38:20](#itNWRmyZVkgPoXvaflVVwNuRsFMCVlFSCybGjN9nrXA) <zentrog>:
The word "ownership", to me has connotations of control, like access control, and responsibility (for things like cleanup, or some other management of the owned things). I don't know that it implies any of that in this case, or if there would be any plans for stuff like that in the future. I'm just trying to understand the scope of 'ownership' specifically, since it's somewhat distinct from reactivity, which I think I have a better grasp of

Anyway, it's an interesting design decision. It should be pretty easy to wrap it with a subscription-based observer if needed, so it doesn't necessarily give anything up, but I imagine the implementation is much simpler

That's up to the implementer :)
We don't evaluate every block we create, so we could start from only attaching a cache to blocks on `do` or `reduce`.

`use` is always going to have  a lot of overhead (you need to `bind/copy`, otherwise it would break recursive functions etc.) R2 has a flag for the `return`issue, I don't recall if Red does too; I prefer a different solution to that problem though (function-local return).

In Topaz, `return` is a word local to each function. It does not exist as a global word or native.
```

@greggirwin I still don't get it. As mentioned at the end of my listing, there are only those **2** cases where ;;; is used in the current code. All other cases mentioned (234 + 6 = 240) with ;; would only break if you were to break them yourself, attempting to comment out those lines with a badly behaved function of your ide, one that would prepend comment with ";" instead of "; ". My current proposition is that ;; behaves the same way it does already unless a double ;; comes up before the end of line, in which case that should close the comment within that line. And as for triple ;;; - they should supersede all ;; or ;.

Look at %system/runtime/start.reds. A huge number of comments there start with `;;` and would break, correct?

Hello. I'm new to Red.

> And while code is expected to change, once people depend on a function or library it causes them pain if we break compatibility. We don't want to do that, though sometimes we will for the greater good and the long view. 

This is meant as a friendly warning, team.  A COBOL perspective biased opinion.  The *long view* is always back and fore compatibility.  Even if the codebase gets versioning branches.  I.e. There is no *greater good* when old source won't load, or old binaries won't run.  Long view is, once stuck with a decision, remain stuck to the decision.  That can't be a hard rule, but if it eats at your soul with every breaking change decision, you are keeping the long view and greater good in mind, ever expanding with no cutoffs.   Ì†ΩÌ∏â

Updated protocols should support old, even when it's more work in system code and support.  Pollute a namespace if needs be with the new things.  In the long term, think about keeping a system that runs code from 5, 10, 50 years ago.  Red could easily make 50, or 500.

@btiffin I agree with Brian that far too many languages break code over time, and this causes loss of products and useful things. The entire industry goes through 25-30 year cycles where a language achieves large marketshare, and whole piles of code are rewritten, and then that language's evolution invariably breaks the existing code.

A few languages have been able to resist changing (such Wolfram language in Mathematica), usually due to the BDFL (benevolent dictator), but people are mortal, and you can see when the dictator leaves that the floodgates can open to major changes as we are seeing in Swift and starting with Python.

I believe the solution is fairly simple. Change your syntax to include a language version number required in each source file, so that future versions can attempt to forward convert and save your code. Assuming that one has access to meta-files like makefiles, etc. is a foolish idea, as code moves around in files not as complete projects.

In my Beads language, i require `beads 1 program mytest`, and the first 2 tokens are the indicator of the language, and the second token is the language level. Some day when level 2 comes out, if there are breaking changes, an automatic fixer program can be deployed perhaps.

i think Red should imitate my sensible practice so that code can live a very long time.

@CodingFiend_twitter  Excellent points!

Java‚Äôs original mission statement: ‚ÄúWrite once, run anywhere‚Äù was a huge boost for the nascent language. Perhaps ‚ÄúWrite once, run forever‚Äù  would be an irresistable siren call to today‚Äôs framework-updating addled dev depts.

We can cut Red some slack right now for two main reasons. First, it is still officially in beta so any feature is implicitly experimental - and thus not in its persistent adult form.

Second, Red is not engineered specifically for persistent consistency at the moment, and the skills to make that a core feature are rare.

But - as a goal ‚Äì a language with guaranteed temporal consistency is just what the world really needs today. It‚Äôs even what blockchain contract code absolutely requires ‚Äì can‚Äôt get more relevant than that :)

[14:11:44](#ZasS5fZ2Tc71TLh0OCvONJ1nYiv6gHvMbiK9xcGX0bE) <zwortex (zwortex)>:
I feel like throwing a stone in the pond (the cat among the pigeons). These are unrealistic expectations if you excuse my saying. Red is a free-form language : no type constraint enforced, no arity, not even reserved words. Consequently the only true mitigation action to counteract how the language might evolve, not in the years to come, but on a daily basis, is to ship along with your code a safety harness of tests. Because your code might run in whatever environment, in particular not the one you expect, not even an environment that is an official version of Red. That being said, versioning is a nice short-cut to prevent running against an old version of the language, but does not protect against newer ones, whatever they are. To that purpose, I wish, as @btiffin, there was a certain conservatism in the language. But I'd be sorry if such conservatism lead to endless discussions that prevent enhancements alltogether for fear of breaking any existing code. You should not be restrained of having the language evolve, especially in alpha phase. Only the pace for such changes should be measured. And of course those changes should be advertised. To that purpose, you may have some deprecation warnings, whenever a function or a refinement is meant to evolve or dissapear. You may also envisage to collect some additional material that could serve, subsequently, as part of an auto-check procedure. Such material could be collecting the extended signatures of the functions that are used in your code (arguments, types, including return type) or their version numbers. The auto-check procedure would then verify that these initial signatures or version numbers do fit with the current ones, and trigger otherwise a warning or even block the execution of the code. And at the language level, you could maintain deprecated version of the functions like : print.1, print.2 etc. the same as you do with unix binaries. I'd rather have this sort of conservative flexibility than an absolute fixness, and a forced ascending compatibility.

@zwortex I hope I did  not imply it would be easy! It cetainly isn't.

But - at the very least - it needs to be indelibly engineered into the core of Red/C3 - https://token.red-lang.org/ - why could anyone chose a block chain language tat did not have that consistency guarantee?

And the engineering skllls to make that guarantee for Red/C3 ae also a worthy goal for the core of Red too.

@dsunanda, I know nothing about Blockchain. So it's a mere comment. I guess the stability required in Red/C3 is a highly desirable feature given they are used for contracts. But, in my opinion, this is not as much desirable for the core of the language. One reason being you rarely modify contracts, while you do so constantly with code, either downloading some new version of it or modifying it yourself. If you happen to upgrade your Red environment, you may amend the code you run but you shan't modify any contract. Therefore, as far as the code is concerned, it is more important to detect what might compromise your code and be given a chance to adjust to it : henceforth the auto-check feature I was mentioning. Still, the language could provide a backward compatibility feature so that any "old" code might keep working in the future. That is an extra challenge, if you put on top the need of being compatible across various environments. If core functions have non-regression tests for each version, you may provide older version of those functions within newer versions of the language, and let the user determine what version he is using. Those older versions could be the original implementations, or may have be rewritten, as long they satisfy the original tests set. That is definitely a nice feature to have and maybe not that much of work. You need to write or upgrade those tests anyway for each version. What I would not like however is to end up in a situation where you have everywhere sign posts saying : don't touch anything, for that would break existing code. This does not feel right to me : a language that is dead, even before being alive.

It's a big issue, and there's no single answer; just a balancing act. 

For Red, it's what a particular version of the runtime might understand. Not just official versions, but custom runtimes, or alternate versions. In a strictly controlled environment, e.g. a ratified IETF protocol, version numbers can have very strong meanings. Messages in protocols include a version number for that reason. So receivers can react accordingly. But that doesn't guarantee that a given receiver will understand a given version. And Red, including its runtime, is not a protocol. Can we, and should we, strictly document *everything*? No. But we can do more of that for the most important elements.

I'm not the first to note that SemVer, while a noble goal, doesn't solve the problem. In the case of a BDFL, including @CodingFiend_twitter for Beads, it's easier to control. In the case of teams of people working quickly on APIs with large surface areas and complex behavior. Your trust that the versioning means what *you think* it means is entirely on the authors having the same understanding and *also* getting all the details technically right. i.e. there is no software analysis I know of, or even annotation systems to support it, that can identify major, minor, patch level compatibilities.

The other approach is JSON. Douglas Crockford broke compatibility but then said "never again". JSON will not change, ever, for all time. So what we have are many competing derivatives. JSON won, but over time has faced the same issue as all frozen tech. Time marches on and as soon as someone needs even a little more of something, they have to be incompatible. Success breeds this problem. And it's just a data format. As soon as you have functionality, it gets worse. R2 would still be viable if not for things like TLS than can't be fixed in the closed source code. Security and new algorithms *will* change things. But fundamentals can carry you a long way, as can abstractions, protecting high level users from changes underneath.

XML went the other way. Here's a core, and everything done in the real world is an extension, so include your DTDs and such to look them up, and be reliant on all those other actors doing their job well. Some might say this falls under the modern "opinionated" label.

Back when I specialized in BASIC/VB, I remember chatting at a conference about this. MS took great pains, until .NET finally broke down the wall, to break as little as possible in the language. It may have been an Intersystems conference, as those guys also put compatibility at the top of their list (which is good if you're running hospital software). What I remember is a C dev being amazed at that, where every C compiler broke their code with every new release, and not just in small ways. This with an ostensibly simple language.

JS has a committee (well, as ES it does), but no single person, or even a small group, can know what they'll break with things they add to the standard. So there *is* a standard, and it breaks things, but also evolves for important things people push it to do. But those standards, as with many in bureaucracies, are reactive, *after* some project(s) in the wild made something so popular that they included it.

Blockchain is a whole 'nother beast, but also shows what we need to consider for things out of our control (i.e. modules and packages). This is where versioning *can* be very useful, and aligns with the need for tests. If there's a version of X out there, it should be there for all time so you can get that exact version when you need it. If yours is the only company depending on X, and you go out of business, they are no longer needed in the world. If everybody in the world uses it, e.g. the core Red runtime, it's there until the last user is gone. Everything else is somewhere in between. The most important bits get more redundancy, and change less over time to ease the pain of migration.

Noone pushes you to constantly update the core, unless for a security fixes. I also don't understand, where the notion of breaking something in design of the language, comes from. We are not talking about daily / monthly changes, but the possible evolutions of the language.

If you are eventually talking the Linux scenario, where there is language / runtime installed and updated regularly, that's a different scenario. But I don't consider Red being such a language. During all those years, I also keep the small exe of the language in a folder of my app. So in that regard, it works like - forever.

This is one of our top priorities. You may have noticed a number of deep bugs being fixed recently. In the next quarter I/O will get focused attention, so the low level interface can be released in automated builds.

[17:57:59](#M-HbKtQr_Wniosn-ZzGW5lYl0zqJDuJW1NjD_xzPGgA) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
@Oldes AFAIK there is no design in place for codec properties. With CSV we exposed separate encoder/decoder funcs with refinements, to be used directly. For images, we need to look at the APIs in %platform/image*.reds to see what's supported for that specific case, but in general for codecs we should start a discussion about it. I don't know if @qtxie has any draft designs to share. 

Because each code needs a standard interface, and is an object today, an obvious choice would be to add an `options` word to the codec objects, which could reference a block, a map, an `options` object, or even a dialected set of `option` commands. Then it's a matter of documenting and implementing options for each codec.

I guess you compile your code with `red -c`, it will generate a libRedRT included `view` module which use GTK. If you don't need view, clear the current libRedRT with`red clear`. Then use `red --no-view -c` to compile the code again.

Technically this crosses the line between bug fix and design choice. But even if it's a bug fix, if you rely on the buggy behavior, it still breaks your code in these rare cases. Chances are, if you're doing things this change affects, you already worked around it by pre-`form`ing problematic values (tags mainly).

On breaking change.  Yes, sometimes these are a necessity, but in the grand scheme of things; **any** breaking change in a language effectively limits the growth potential, lopping off the tail of the codebase that has built up.  But, for Red, being sub 1.0 there is wiggle room.  Just don't wiggle too much or you deny Red an infinitely growing codebase, and end up putting in life expectancy limits.  Not always a bad thing, but it can be a sad thing.  Ì†ΩÌ∏â

@Oldes I was hoping I could talk to numerous small bluetooth enabled devices mainly for data gathering. Very simple app(s): Connect to device-gather data-display it-store it.  I have a Weigh Scale that gathers 17 different measurements. When investigating the manufacturer supplied app, I found it gathers your info from the scale then sends all of it to the manufacturer!! It also sends info from your phone's address book, etc, etc.   I think I can do better.

Covid19 temperature checks are just a placebo. Yes, if your temperature is high, there is a good possibility that you have Covid19. If you temperature is normal, there is a slightly reduced chance of you having Covid19.

Based on infection statistics, in areas where more than 80% of the population have been vaccinated, 80% of the Covid19 cases would be missed by a temperature check.

A Covid19 breath test would not only be a most time Red application but also an extremely useful one.

> <@greggirwin-55659ddb15522ed4b3e1006f:gitter.im> @hiiamboris Red *is* functional, just not *purely* functional. The key here, @hitesman:matrix.org is that Haskell and other PF langs rely on immutability as a core principle, while mutability is central to Red. You will find that `copy` is an important function for times when you *don't* want something mutated. We also have some important notes on why things work this way, but won't throw you into the deep end yet. :^) Welcome to the community!

Thank you for the explanation. The caveat of being able to create smaller, maintainable code, especially in regards to graphics, is a large draw for me. It's been interesting to read about game development, but the overall scope and size of current software for game engines seem to make them a pretty unwieldly beast, prone to a lot of errors.

R2 lexes `1.` as a decimal, as does Red with the new fast lexer. But Red *used to* throw an error for that (`Syntax Error: invalid integer!`). Similar issue for `1.2.` which now becomes a tuple of 1.2.0, formerly `Syntax Error: invalid float!`.

My gut says these are malformed values and should not infer the extra data.

What do others think?

I actually leveraged this feature in an R2 dialect once, but never felt good about it. You could write a list of numbers with commas separating them. e.g. `1, 2, 3, 4`, but the syntax had to be just right of course, and then you ended up with a mix of floats and integers.

greggirwin (Gregg Irwin): I think I've used them in hand writing (i.e. school work), but I don't know if I've ever used them on a computer. But that could also be because software/programming languages can be strict about it. When entering decimal values on a calculator, I would probably opt for the fewest keypresses, though the value would likely be displayed with the leading zero.
The `1.` syntax looks like an element of a numbered list. I could understand treating it as an `integer!` even, but I think a syntax error is probably better

@aagroove4_gitlab there is no IDE yet, for things like step tracing or breakpoints, but we have a lot of ideas in that area. There is a new feature coming too, for monitoring the interpreter. We will also explore using reactivity and object ownership in this area.

Like other aspects and features, we want to design in ways that solve problems in a better way. For example, debugging a local app, or a single service component, has very different needs than debugging a distributed system. In the best of all possible worlds, we can unify things in a way that leverages a consistent mental model. e.g. eventing systems, even internally in apps.

Better to use `split` in this case. Having `to block!` split strings is probably not going to happen in Red. One of those things R2 had to try and be helpful, but overall not a win from a design standpoint.

[19:13:16](#yhyasW43J5aJBFV3V4GetD_sBwMhMH-_nbAgk0Fgy7s) <henrikmk (Henrik Mikael Kristensen)>:
Split is less useful, since it ruins path notations. Then the "proper" way would be to write a loop with SPLIT-PATH.

[19:14:12](#rBovbkw4BDmXyK27zbq1xMwivz3AfJojCVoY-KS1utg) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
In a shell environment, maybe handy, as R2 also handled backslashes this way:
```
>> to-block %\z\f\e\
== [/z /f /e /]
```
But because it's not splitting the path into `file!` elements, mapping them to refinements doesn't have many uses, does it? And the special case of an empty element (`/`) becomes a `word!`.

They do have different meaning, as their original type. So let's ask what happens if we do this.

- `Block!` now has to understand the lexical form of `any-string!` types, which couples it to those forms internally. 

- For each type, we have to decide what the constituent parts become. For `file!`, all results can be `file!`. For `email!`, should they all become strings? URLs? Does it handle path seps intelligently when round-tripping? Can all values round-trip? (side note: Ladislav did some great work on `split-path + rejoin`, with round-tripping as a consideration.)

```
>> to url! ["http://" "a" "b/" "c"]
== http://://a/b//c
```

Identifying use cases helps here, so we can see where gaps are that have real value.

I'm 100% behind writing these things down and analyzing it. These are important docs in any case.

@zentrog:matrix.org so far modules have been designed from the organizational and source/interpreted view. I don't know of a "fat binary" format for shared modules, but wrapping platform specifics would work just like all other R/S code. The reason I mention "interpreted" is because modular compilation is not high on our roadmap, and is a big task. We will work hard to plan for that in the module design, so nothing has to change for users when it's supported. That is, you can run interpreted or compile your app normally, but every module will be recompiled, just like the runtime. To offset the speed hit there, you can still build custom runtimes which include modules, just like `view` today, for dev mode work.

If it simplifies things to assume modules containing Red/System must be compiled, that would make perfect sense to me. Is the general plan for them to just be .red or .reds files? Other eventual features like compiling to shared library, or JIT compilation would solve some of those issues too.
Once modules are available for general use, I think it lowers the bar a lot for community members to contribute features like this, and experiment easier without needing to worrying so much about how it would fit into the Red project

There are many aspects to modules. We do want people to be able to build, share, and use them, and for them to be bundled together. It should be possible for someone to group modules, put a consistent interface over them, and release that. Ideally, there is a package and organization system that supports this, and also an optional blockchain aspect for verification and tokenomics.

There are ways to hack around platform issues, but security is perhaps the most important element in all this.

To @hiiamboris' point, sometimes you won't even have access to a module's source, but I don't have a unified design for modules vs shared libraries.

I glanced at the LSP spec yesterday, but have looked at it before. Many thoughts of course. :^) It makes perfect sense if you're selling an editor and want to promote adoption. Get others to write the parsers for you. But protocols need to be stable, and extending them takes time. LSP is predicated on the few features people think are most important based on history (syntax highlighting, go to definition, autocomplete). But being a protocol kind of locks you into *just* those things they  included, and long periods to add a few features. Looks like some semantics came in the new version. But then you have to update your protocol handlers of course, because it's not just a parser, but a full analyzer and reflective help system...which has to match LSP as the lowest common denominator for what you can ask.

For Red, including the use of libRed, the parsing is done. Now you can ask questions like:

- How do I know when the user is inside a dialect?
- Do I offer just a "code" API, or can they ask about the source as data too?

There are absolutely things we can and should learn from LSP, Eclipse, and more. Our primary goal will not be to make tools for other langs, though people will, but to show how Red's approach facilitates much more. Some things will be built in (app framework level), others will be plugins (what is *our* protocol?), and IDEs can be domain specific too. We're also thinking hard about systems development and operation in general.

Hi folks. Played with Rebol back in the day, and thinking of trying Red for a personal project. But it would be data intensive, so before I invest the time in re-learning the language I have a question about performance. Ivo Balbaert claims in his book that optimised Red runs around 2-3 times slower than C. If that's true it's remarkable at this stage of development, because that would put it in the same ballpark as C#/Java/Go. For heavy data processing, could I realistically expect this kind of performance?

All that said, that is R/S performance, meaning you're writing at the C level. If you use Red as a high level language, it will be on par with other scripting languages. If you have hard number goals, and more precise information on data layout, format, and volume, we can give better advice. e.g. if you have a lot of data, but can store it in Red or redbin format, loading will be *really* fast. If you have to parse data, we have CSV and JSON codecs already, which you can test easily.

If you're doing a lot of numeric work, what @ldci said applies. With Red you can write most of your code at the high level, then mix in R/S routines for optimized bits. e.g. compare the two mandelbrot versions in https://github.com/red/code/tree/master/Scripts.

1. R/S is slower than C.
2. The R/S implementation is slower than zlib.

* > But it is strange, that decompression is so much slower than compression. It should be opposite, like with the binding version. 

Two main reasons:

1. R/S is slower than C.
2. The R/S implementation is slower than zlib.

The R/S version is ported from this C code:
https://gist.github.com/vurtun/760a6a2a198b706a7b1a6197aa5ac747

We can compare the C version with zlib, then we know how much is the C version slower than zlib.

The R/S deflate use static Huffman tree encoding only. If using dynamic tree as zlib, it should be much slower. But the compression ration should be much better.

It would be possible to have description strings on `/local` words? It would be nice for function documentation on `SPEC-OF`

Example:

```
valid-column-names?: func [
	"Check if a block contains only words or string" 
	data [block!] "The block to check"
	/local 
        {This is a note}
	data-local "To be used as local copy of data positioned at head position"
	element "The current element to check"
	out "The output result"

```
morph/auto [1 2 3 4] ['x ? odd? x | x < 3 | skip ...] ['x ...]

morph/auto [1 2 3 4] ['x ? [odd? x | x < 3] | skip ...] ['x ...]

Was my expectation wrong? How to achieve comparison with multiple criteria?

`bind` is a double edged sword. We want it to help us fetch named rules, but somehow want to preserve parts of the rule as code. Catch-22 by the looks of it.

But there will be another issue: you won't be able to compose rules from different contexts. Like currently there's `scan-rules` and your own ruleset(s). But if it's a map it has to be prepared upfront. Likely as `extend copy scan-rules user-scan-rules`. That is, composability is limited this way.

We don't seem to have a ticket for this, and R2 behaves the same. I don't know if changing this has deep implications or not, or how to work around it at the moment. On the `help` side, giving it a function (e.g. `:emit-rules/to`) means there's no name, so it just dumps the value.

Well, every feature will be natural or foreign to individuals.  But here I'll note a key difference in `parse` vs regex or even other grammar notations. Parse uses words to describe e.g., `[opt any some to thru]`. But I'm not being critical of `morph` (yet ;^) because I'm still in a position of ignorance.

@pekr I don't find `any` more readable than `...`. `any` spells out verbally, but visually it is not distinctive from the other rules.
But I have counterquestions for you:
- are `any`/`some` rules defined in Morph?
- if not, can they be defined yourself?
- how is `any [rule]` different from `[rule ...]`?

I would like to open a ticket because I think we have a naming problem with `index` used in `at` so its help string.

In Rebol and Red, `index? ` returns the ABSOLUTE position:

```
>> a: [a b c d]
== [a b c d]
>> index? a
== 1
```

If we change the start of the series:

```
>> a: [a b c d]
== [a b c d]
>> a: next next a
== [c d]
>> index? a
== 3
```

So, when we states in `AT` help string:

```
USAGE:

DESCRIPTION: 
     Returns a series at a given index. 
     AT is an action! value.

ARGUMENTS:
     series       [series! port!] 
     index        [integer! pair!]

You may say that as `INDEX?` help string mentions
*relative to the head* and the developer will understand `AT` uses a relative one but having seen this misunderstanding happening a lot of time, I am sure the first thought is `INDEX = (INDEX? series)`

So think we should change the help `AT` string a follow:

*Returns a series at a given index, **RELATIVE** to the current position*

@GiuseppeChillemi thanks for the note. I don't know how common this misunderstanding it, but it doesn't jump out in my memory as something that has come up a lot. The goal, of course, is making things clear. And consistent if possible.

As I look at series actions, `index?` is the exception to the rule, and `[length? skip clear]` mention "current index" (`[find select]` mention it for `/reverse`). `Index?` alone *doesn't* use the current index. For many actions no index arg is given, but a couple do: `[pick poke]`.

Nothing else uses "current position" as terminology. Using a different word there solves the ugliness and confusion of this wording: *Returns a series at a given index, **RELATIVE** to the current index*, but doesn't make the problem go away.

`[head tail head? tail?]` are interesting, because `head/?` refer to the first *index*, while `tail/?` refer to the last *value*.

I don't know if changing `at`'s doc string will help much, unless we decide to do it for all other series actions, which makes them all longer. We have to consider the goal of doc strings as well. They're more like clues or reminders, and necessarily can't contain too much detail.

A more important clarification might be between `at` and `skip` but, again, we have to rely on the user thinking a bit about what the names imply. We can't explain 1 vs 0 offsets meaningfully in short doc strings. That's what real docs are for. Adding "relative" to `at`, while it's already used for `skip` for that distinction might muddy *those* waters.

I'm OK with how "current index" is used in `clear` because it makes the language much more natural IMO.

I hope others will give their thoughts as well.

@greggirwin  While you see each instance of the same series as a reference to the same data and an index, I see a position and its index, where "position" is more like a physical place and index is its street address; so we have multiple places, each one with a number that is always relative to the head of a series. As human, you don't say: "you will find me at number 4" but "you will find me at the fourth door from your current position", because you always count indexes from the head until you specify it is a RELATIVE index. Low-level Red coders see indexes everywhere, humans see one absolute index and the current position, as a physical one. 

If we call "the absolute index" the distance from the first absolute element and the "relative index" the one from the series current position, we could use the concepts as follow:

`skip` uses offset 
`at` uses relative indexing to the current position
`pick` uses relative index
`poke` uses relative index
`index?` returns the absolute index
`head/?` refers to the element in the first absolute position  
`tail/?` refers to the element after the last position.
`path!` use relative indexing 

As you note, I have used the word "absolute" only for `head/?` because there are multiple first positions but just one `tail` for all, so you need to specify which one in the former but not in the latter. 

Some other obsearvations:

`AT` has an short-circuit between `0`and `1` because `at series 0` and `AT series 1` returns the both the same element;
`pick series 0 ` gives none 
`poke series index value` returns an `out of range` message

So, as the common working of everything else seems to not return value when using `0` it should noted only in `AT` help string that position `0` = `1`

I think we're overcomplicating the index discussion. Yes, some people may be confused, but for that we write (or find existing) docs. `Index?` calls out that it behaves differently, and it *must*. If it didn't work relative to the head of the series, it would always return 1. :^)

[20:35:53](#3jI3b0NDK-M0BOVKcqm5cU4wLgudr3__5asZCJJPc80) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
Note that Carl spent an entire chapter on series in the [Rebol Core Guide](http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore-6.html). He also uses `position` widely, and the `index?` doc says "Returns the offset from the head of the series." The words `offset` and `distance `are also used. He doesn't choose words lightly, so the fact that he explicitly chose "position" for descriptive purposes, but `index` for the associated parameter name tells us something. To me it says that we are crossing a boundary between how people think, and the more strict computer aspect.

Where he uses the term "relative" it's always given a subject, like "current position" or "head". He never uses the term absolute. None of this mean he's infallible, but my take is that there is no easy answer here. 

@rgchris wrote [this article](https://medium.com/@rgchris/understanding-rebol-series-d5d6f597a239) which has a nice diagram. It's not the one I was thinking of, but it's on track. What I would change about it is moving `index` to where `pick` is, and use `position` at the top, where `index` is now.

Yeah, the two words 'position' and 'index' are almost synonymous, but I think 'position' is slightly more abstract about where something is located, where 'index' is specifically a numeric representation of a 'position'.

For the relative/absolute discussion, I think it's worth pointing out that there are two distinct concepts that are being discussed, which are kind of being lumped together under the same term. The underlying series, and references to that series, which have an implicit relative offset. My feeling is that if you are talking about the underlying series, then it helps to use the absolute/relative terminology, but if you are talking about a reference, then saying "relative to" seems redundant, because it's already implied. The language that will make the most sense depends on which concept you are linking to when you think of "series".

On colors in markdown, @GiuseppeChillemi has anyone proposed an actual syntax for it? Markdown is meant to be very light, readable as plain text, high S/N ratio. This is for both authors and readers. While it's true that authors only write it once, and readers read it many times, this puts more burden on authors in an already muddy and flexible format, and only the end readers benefit (until we have tools to hide all the details). Those who have to read the source now have more noise too.

This is the curse of success for simple things. They keep getting extended until they encompass the functionality of the things they were designed to replace, at which point a new young gun shows up in town to start the cycle again.

The main problem I see with this is that there is no thought beyond `Colors!`. Like, what are colors used for? Is there another way to provide more value, with less work? If you really just want to mark certain things with color, use another format. If we can identify semantics for where colors are applied, that's more overall information, and can be used to generate other end results.

Thanks also for the extensive docs. Is there an example of supporting both a main func and sub commands? That is, you either need to `process-into` a func *or* a context, and there's no magic `program-name` default, for example, handled in the context.

I'd also like others to weigh in on POSIX vs Windows CLI syntax. i.e. `-o`/`--option` vs `/option`. I think I brought this up in early chat on it @hiiamboris, but don't remember any resolution.

My thought here is *not* to make it more comfortable for Windows users, though consistency on platforms is a good thing for them. It's about slash syntax being more Red-like, and how we want to build systems composed of communicating parts. Not just CLI but dialected messages. Consistency for Red users and systems is the most important thing. This aligns with some approaches to `apply`, where refinements and their args can be spread through a call.

This is a big-picture design issue, and quite important IMO. On the one hand, the more we constrain formats and standards the simpler our code is, and the more robust and secure we can make it. OTOH, messages are just data, dialects provide security, and we can't see how this will be used when we move beyond the confines of old-school CLI constraints.

From what I've seen, even Microsoft doesn't use the `/option` syntax anymore for its newer cli apps (with the possible exception of `/?`). E.g.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/command-line-arguments?tabs=windows
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/basic-commands

I would just stick with the POSIX, as it's basically ubiquitous. Using `/` because it's more Red-like seems like leaking language details out to the end user, who should really not be concerned about which language the app is written in.

This means reserving some word for context description. I'd rather solve this in Red. Why we can't have docstrings for contexts? Nenad told previously it's possible we'll have a commend field attachable to any Red value down the road. This will solve the issue without kludges.

Right now you have a `/post-scriptum` option (I'm not fully happy with and it's probably not working with contexts right now anyway Ì†ΩÌ∏â, or you can just use `print` to display additional help.

With R2, I was used to open a port and immeditely wait on it. Once I did so on two sides, I was able to easily `insert`into port and read from it via `copy`. I know, that Carl was a bit versed about async networking, as it was clear, that in some regard, it is going to be more complicated for the user.

Now let me post the following code:
```
server: open tcp://:8123

server/awake: func [event] [
    if event/type = 'accept [new-client event/port]
    false
]
```
For me, mentally, `open` means an immediate action of opening a tcp connnection (in above case). The only thing I would await would be `wait`on port. How comes, that the `awake` function comes later in the code? What if some events start flowing, before `awake` gets defined? Or does `open`really don't mean opening a port here, and is mostly a `make port!`?

Second - could we have a schemes / templates, so that we don't necessarily have to define `awake`manually?

Third - even if I define `awake` for the very simple server and insert into the connection from the other gui console, wait simply hangs the console. Is there any limitation to the `wait`in regards to the gui console, compared to the cli console for e.g.?

Only if you `wait` on that port before defining `awake` function.

I am not sure. This is what I get from R2:

** Access Error: Cannot connect to 127.0.0.1
** Near: client: open tcp://127.0.0.1:7999

And as I expected, what I get from Red is - it returns back to the console, like it would connect to the local server, even if there is not any. I am not sure I like that!

@pekr - no, there's a huge difference between `make port!` and `open`. If you only make the port, nothing happens (I assume this is the same for Red); if you open it, *it will start the connection* the next time the interpreter goes through the event loop. This is true for R2 async, R3 and Red, and any other language or library that implements async I/O.

Today, they broke the loop and said "Yes I checked https://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html from my machine and there was not any Malwarebytes block."

[please excuse the long message, meant for the forum --which is apparently down]

Bonjour, Noob here!

I'd like to port a lightweight language to a Z80-based computer older than you (the Amstrad CPC 6128), and to CP/M as well if there is interest.
More context [here](https://www.pouet.net/topic.php?which=12155&page=1#c571455).

Red is one the the most interesting in my book, I'm just afraid it might be a bit too big.

My first questions are:
- Is there already related work ?(my google-fu wasn't strong enough)
- Is anyone interested to work on that with me? (I'm an outgoing introvert, according to my dog). Following Erd√≤s, I believe that programming is the perfect social activity for asocials (ok, just kidding, I don't mean to reinforce stereotypes).

I admit I highly appreciare the instrumented interpreter path taken. Since I have built a simple debugger that prints the function call stack, I can fix my code a lot faster than before.

Arabic is not my speciality ( I did study Phonecian, but for a diff purpose), and this is one of those topics where things get complex fast.  

Most of us here speak/understand more than one language, which helps a lot. So we know some things DON'T map from language to language, even counting.  In Japanese for example there are shapes that go with the thing you are counting.  In Semitic (Hebrew Arabic) you have gender in numbers too.

In English you have Here and There, but in Spanish and Japanese (and many languages) you have the concept or Here (with me), there (with you), and way over there (away from the two of us).  I mention this because I recall Arabic having the concept of 1, and 2, but 2 is not plural, but rather another single thing of 2 parts.  This comes up in numbering things.

So, summed up, complex.   Not sure how much you can encode early on other than just western (Arabic) and Hindi representation of numbers to start.  This all needs an API where you hand it the whole sentence or context and it gives you back the best it can do, is my guess.

Also of note (since I was helping someone with Chinese recently, there are places where numbers get confusing since they don't have commas and periods. Solve?  They switch to words.  In English this might look strange where homophones can be used together with real numbers, like: 

1thing2knowIWasBorn19SixT

(not a perfect example, but gets the feeling), in Brazil I know they change the name of numbers to words sometimes)

Wait, I know an example in English................. When saying numbers over a radio, you say 'Niner' (9) as opposed to Nine to avoid confusion (I suspect with Five, due to the Eye sound coming over).

Bottom line, there is too much here to solve in the core system, it needs a massive library in my opinion.

Chinese also pronounce one differently from the way it's written.  One is normally pronounced as `yi` but when you have a string of ones together, eg. emergency dial in NZ is `111` it then sounds like `yiyiyi` or `eee`.  So, instead it's pronounced as `yah`

Formatting is coming to Red. @hiiamboris has built a playground app for the core mask-based number formatting that's in progress. I'm going to post it here, and have digitally signed it so it shouldn't trigger any A/V false positives. Let me know if it does.

It's relatively self-explanatory, but post questions here. Most importantly, try it. Play around. Let us know what you discover by exploring, and also *especially* if you get unexpected results or what you think might be bugs. Let us know your background as well, to give your comments context. @btiffin is an old COBOL guy, for example, and @Dobeash is a heavy spreadsheet user. If you use another dev lang, that's OK. ;^) Let us know how this stacks up to what that lang offers.

@hiiamboris "The Roman calendar began the year on 1 January, and this remained the start of the year after the Julian reform.  However, even after local calendars were aligned to the Julian calendar, they started the new year on different dates."

`call` does not expand anything:
```
>> call/console "reddo probe [%path%]"
[%"path%"]
```
If your target program just use the command line as a whole, like `reddo` does above, then no other action may be needed.

If you want to pass something to command processor then it makes sense to quote filenames. Since file names do not contain double quote, it magically works. Percent and other special chars should however be escaped with `^`.

Libc-based programs AFAIK will also replace every `\\` with `\`, and idk maybe even interpret some escape sequences. But they won't recognize `^` as an escape char, nor will expand the envvars.

So, again, it totally depends on the program being called, on Windows. Because Windows passes whole command line to the process as a string, and that program may split it then into arguments.

In contrast to Linux, where command line does not exist as a whole, and each process receives a set of arguments directly. So theoretically you do not need to do anything to pass them to a Linux process. But since we unify these details under the `call` umbrella, `call` just calls Bash and lets it split the command line into arguments. There you can at least rely on all shells having the same interpretation of it.

@Oldes it's an important item, on my list for a long time. Need to consider the modern world, and avoid the worst mistakes of other systems. Simplicity is also key, providing the fundamentals, including security, while letting others build on top of that.

@Oldes I really liked [this article](https://medium.com/@sdboyer/so-you-want-to-write-a-package-manager-4ae9c17d9527) for many aspects it touched on.

I will send you some of my notes privately, as they aren't organized or fit for public consumption.

Some of the worst mistakes we should avoid:

- Not considering security as job one. See: SolarWinds
- Complexity. See: Software
- Versioning gone wrong. See: "Thinking SemVer solves all your problems"
- SPoF. This applies to both the package system infrastructure, but also packages maintained by a single person or small team. See: Abandonware
- Having a commercial entity "own" the main repo, which may contain FOSS packages. See: NPM (the corporation)
- Ambiguity about whether a package can be modified or removed. See: LeftPad
- The goodwill and efforts of FOSS contributors being unfairly exploited. See: The Internet
- Chaos and sprawl. See: "Any package system with no guidelines for how to organize things."
- Popularity as the standard metric of quality. See: Pop culture

That's the short list anyway. :^)

https://libraries.io/ is a very cool resource, as it shows not only how many packages each system has, but what package systems we can look at for ideas.

Not a part of a package manager, but I've been thinking it would be interesting to treat external packages as untrusted, so they wouldn't be allowed to touch the filesystem, call external executables or libraries, read global application state, etc. unless explicitly granted permission by the application. It would make not only supply chain attacks, but also library vulnerabilities much harder to exploit. For instance the log4j fiasco. Are there other languages that have anything like that?

Once again we are talking a new stuff (package managers) noone imo needs right now, without having bare bones stuff like IO, concurrency model, modules, etc. sorted out and finished in specs ... well, at least as far as Red publicly known resources go ...
 
I have recently found an R3/Ren-C thought about the async stuff as done in R3, the limitation of the aproach taken and reasoning for why the green threads might be the way to go as an interesting example, especially as I remember Andreas Bolka (top Rebol community member back at the time) stating, that R3 networking code is a total trash, suited well for a complete replacement. So I am just wondering, what model Red follows?

We‚Äôre talking about it because Oldes asked. Nobody is dropping work on the thing you mentioned just to work on package manager, so don‚Äôt worry :)

[11:48:43](#eOEKKYxaawwDANCMzQUmIPaLCOmDW4LK1ROUUv7YQvc) <hiiamboris (NOT THIS ONE)>:
@Oldes if you still long for more misery in your life :) I think what would be useful at current stage is:
1. Ability to fetch packages from the web, so end user would not have to figure out what to download and where to place it.
   Bolek's `redquire` has this but in my understanding his attempt was an adhoc helper for himself only, not meant for public use. It doesn't include for example any code that would handle failed download attempts (which happen quite often to me).
2. Ability to cache downloaded packages so subsequent runs are fast.
   This is quite an issue though. What if we want to ensure our package is up to date? Browsing commits of every package on every program startup will be a huge slowdown. We could probably create a central index of all packages and their versions and check that first, but still, on a mobile such connection attempt can take seconds to minutes occasionally. So I don't see how that can work in a single threaded environment. Best we can do IMO is to only check for updates *on demand*, and work with the cached version otherwise.
3. Ability to fetch packages from any local root.
   As a package developer I would like to work with the local version I'm developing first, and only when it's not available (e.g. I'm on another PC), then it should be downloaded.
   This is different from (2), because in (2) we hide our cache somewhere in the OS temp folders, but in (3) our files are  somewhere they're easy for us to access. And usage of these two or more roots should be coordinated.
4. Packages should not be single files, but should have a nested structure.
   So one file in the package could import another file in the same or another package, and that file should also be able to import it's own requirements.
   I think `path!`s are a good fit for such *virtual* package tree.
   E.g. `import locale` would import all available locale files, while `import locale/enGB` would import only one. This is often a package user's choice, not author's.
5. No `#include` directives should be used in any package.
   These are so buggy in Red that [I rewrote them for the interpreter from scratch](https://gitlab.com/hiiamboris/red-mezz-warehouse/-/blob/master/include-once.red). To rewrite them for compiler will still take more time.
6. Single inclusion only.
   One of the biggest issues of `#include` is the same file included 50+ times over and over, which happens surprisingly often even in what would seem like very conservative inclusion strategy, leading to 30+ secs load time of the program.
7. Compileability of everything.
   We don't want our code to always be fetched from the web, obviously. Often we just want a single binary free of dependencies.
   So, run-time resolution of dependencies is already a bit too late. Importing function should be a macro, so the code is preprocessed before it's fed to the compiler. That means it should work in both Red and R2.
   To have less `#include` and `do`-related issues, such macro IMO should just inline all imported code into the script being loaded.
   In this context, we should be able to import code routines and compile it.
   Rest of the code should I think be wrapped into a `do []` block, because relying on compiler's good behavior today will only bring a lot of frustration. Maybe each source file should declare if it's 100% compiler-friendly (e.g. consists of routines only), or if it's not.
8. How to deal with cyclical dependencies?
   E.g. my `#assert` directive executes `expect` func when assertion has been tested and failed. That function shows the evaluation trace of asserted expression so I can see where exactly it failed. But `expect` itself should include assertions that would verify it isn't regressed. That's just an example. We can just put good faith into our ability to structure our packages and bear the burden. Or we could separate loading stage from initialization stage at the file level, and make loading basically orderless, but initialization of each file may specify it's dependencies.

9. I think it's too early to think of execution security, not having a `secure` dialect.
   Today we could sign the packages with a key that we only give to a few individuals we trust, and then check the signatures validity after download. But is it worth the trouble? I find it unlikely for example that someone would hack into my Gitlab account and insert some malignant code.
   Besides, we distribute our code in compiled form usually, so it's only vulnerable before it's compiled.
   I would not bother with security myself at this stage of development.
10. Namespaces. Red doesn't have these, unfortunately, so we'll have to cleverly work around with `make` somehow.
    Point is that multiple files may contribute to the same namespace. E.g. one file may provide `formatting/format-number` and another file - `formatting/format-date`, and yet another file would use both. I have plenty of examples like this.
    And another consideration is that use may want to include the package into another namespace. E.g. to avoid collision with `system/words` or with other package.
11. Ability to import *just data*.
    It may be a headerless Red script, or it may be some CSV or JSON that we want to compile in.
   
It's all something doable today and useful today. Not one of the big conquer the world plans :)

It would be good to monitor either the yellow density levels and also when it surpassed certain treshold, all with a IP camera.

@GiuseppeChillemi: That could be possible since redCV includes color thresholding (see /samples/image_thresholding/colorObject.red). For the IP camera, it depends on Red. Default camera on your computer and usb cameras are supported and I never tested IP camera. You can also used OpenCV.

Great writeup @greggirwin . Also wanted to note about so much tools becoming saas. While great for the creators of these tools, monthly cost for the user grows depending on how many of these tools they want to use.

Even a rookie can build something useful with minimal effort and be a hero.

Well, I'm not sure which one fits better as I just have an idea I trying to experiment with. For example when  there is a web server and a database, having a layer on top of the database as a collection of red objects, where if data changes, it notifies a list of subscribers. Something like that. Just experimenting. What I like about Red...the brain just lights up with ideas.

@greggirwin You've mentioned the Animation dialect being possibly part of the next release. This one, took me by a surprise and is a very nice addition to Red. Always wished to have Scala multimedia in Redbol :-) Might I ask, what was the motive to have it? I really did not see it coming, so thanks for that! .....

[20:33:11](#UeAalBQ2VhjZc0wA9jb39IqDRSCOcfblw62XdJSkHZQ) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
@pekr, the work started out to see what might be possible, but kept relatively simple. There are a number of use cases that made it seem worth the R&D effort.

- A showcase feature that is highly visible. Much of what makes Red special is hard to see. But the GUI aspect is an eye-catcher. I think this will be as well.

- Simple animations during app startup, can be very engaging. As can subtly changing backdrops. We may not think they're important, but do need to consider what appeals to users and a wider audience. Things like that can make an app look slick and polished, even if the guts are exactly the same.

- Much less jarring when async events happen that are shown in a UI. 

- Presentation app that takes %show.r to the next level (Code Name: RedPresent)

- RAPIDE, and maybe even DiaGrammar. For RAPIDE I think it could be a key feature on the UI side, where it can offer a great, live visualization for requests and responses in a flow of API calls.

[20:49:02](#TJXQXvk7qy8Tk7Tl17voXxq1y7cn05sdgrliK5v_gl8) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
Of course, it will also make simple games possible, that are much more fun to watch in action. And while we're not going to display Unity or other tools that people use for visualization and cool youtube videos like [this one about Bezier curves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVwxzDHniEw), maybe it will give some people a new tool for creating visual explanations.

What really made this happen, though, was @GalenIvanov. He stepped up and championed the project, so it didn't take time away from the core team. He did a huge amount of research on other systems, then developed a very clean, idiomatic system. If you haven't looked at the examples, I encourage everyone to do so. Galen has created a wonderfully readable dialect. e.g. 

```
fly-in: start 0.0 duration 2.0 ease :ease-in-out-elastic
...
start 2.0 after fly-in starts duration 2.0 loop two-way 3 times
```

The particles demo shows how he made the design data driven.

Because it's a new feature, feedback will be important, and may drive changes before too much user code is written in it.

Thanks for your feedback @GiuseppeChillemi. And for your thoughts as well @hiiamboris and others.

I agree that the color scheme and showing only advanced demos makes Red Spaces look very experimental. Note that I'm one of those people that hasn't tried to build anything with it. Because of the advanced nature of the demos, it looks intimidating from the outside, even having read the docs.

Why I haven't pushed people toward it is that there are a lot of outstanding questions and priorities to consider. Mixing the table from Red spaces into native GUIs may not be best, but will surely work. Do we focus on just that, or address the full non-native GUI system with focus when that time comes. If we do that, knowing that people *do* need trees and tables, do we extract the table style, or build something else that covers only the basic needs?

To @pekr's question about "table", naming is hard. We have the UI element, the grid/table/spreadsheet, and we have the idea of a `table` module that handles the data aspect, potentially including pivots, summaries, etc., inspired by what Excel calls a "table" that you can have inside a sheet. That underlying data model, if we do it right, should be able to map automatically (or almost) to a UI.

> One things seems to be clear. Those effort does not seem to be coordinated enough, which popped-up with the xml codec and especially CLI module.

CLI will be merged soon, unless something unexpected happens. We try hard to keep the team on the same page(s), and make the best use of everyone's time, but it's not easy. Remember, a lot of what we do is exploratory in nature.

Henrik's amazing `list-view` style for R2 is ~100K of code, while R2's standard `list` style was quite limited in some ways, but very small and usable. The main issue there  had to do with a couple design issues with iterated faces. But I'd be up for something like that in Red. The trickier issue, then, may be dealing with native controls inside the lists sub-layouts, which brings us back to non-native.

What was your methodics to test the required performance? We know, that Red might be slower generally, mostly due to compiling down to R/S and then to native with yet not optimised compiler. Another thing might be, if Red VID (I am not sure) uses base, which is wrappend OS widget, then having many objects might have relatively bad performance . But - we also know, that we've got HW accelerated Draw, ok?

Interesting thing in terms of Rebol's GUI history was the experience of initial Rebol gfx stack, later on with added Draw engine using AGG library. That made Rebol closer to multimedia and all those AGG demos were simply - impressive. Let's keep in mind, AGG was only a software renderer.

Then came R3. Original Rebol's gfx engine was removed and replaced by pure AGG. And face, as kind of big object, was mapped to gob! type, hence much smaller objects. Whereas R2 GUI has allocated 12+MB of RAM, IIRc R3 was something like 2-3 MB or RAM? I know that @qtxie has some experimental gob! branch, but also remember some notes, that for Red gui it might not be all that useful.

Anyone?

@pekr yes, unless it has been changed, DRAW commands in Red are parsed directly one-by-one into draw calls and draw parameters are not bindable to contexts. This means DRAW in Red runs at Red's PARSE speed rather than native speeds.  Changing a parameter means reparsing the whole DRAW block. In R2, you can skip the parsing by simply changing bound parameters, call SHOW and greatly speedup drawing that way (though it's still far from optimal).

This is a really old example I did in R2, and just spent a few minutes porting to Red. Vert slider is reversed, so ignore that. :^) If you drag a slider you get multiple redraws. Ignore that too. Under R2 this ran in real time, with a hint of lag with a grid this size.

Note how the window appears instantly, with the data there, but then drawing, even from the button I added to test that it wasn't slider events overloading it, is slllooooowwwww. `Auto-sync?` has no effect. Just thought to try that.

What happens is that every change to the draw block triggers a refresh, so it seems (need to read the ticket I guess). If you set the face's `draw` to something else, update the draw commands, then set it back. Boom! Super fast, but flickers.

Hi every one, i 'm used to rather scripting than compiling. One reason i went on rebol. But i'm making some tries with red compilation ,it's quite nice, and for red/system it's compelled.

I would like to ask something re maps, and the fact that those use parens, which I consider being visually unpleasant experience in Red in relation to datatypes. But you already know that.

So here goes - why map has to use a special sigil `#` to denote a `map!`. At first sight, it of course looks logical, so maybe the real question si - why `object!`, as a first class datatype, does not need any?

We're agreed on the syntax change for maps, but not for construction syntax.

The big question, though, is construction syntax use cases, now that we have `redbin`. We can also use one syntax for the literal values above, which leaves the door open for a more general construction syntax using `#(...)` later.

I'm not sure arguing about it leads anywhere. It's all opinions at this point (because nobody can agree on what's important).
I would like `mold/all` to be the default, because you almost never want to not use `/all`. (For things like `probe`, maybe, but even then it can be more bad than good.) If redbin is the answer, that means that `save`, `mold` etc. would have to use redbin by default, which is a big change. I don't doubt that there are a ton of cases where redbin is the best choice, but is it *always*?

Coming from https://gitter.im/red/bugs?at=61f9024df5a394780033201f

@Oldes @hiiamboris (and everyone else) I hope you realize by now that in cases where we disagree, you can win, you can have your way, and I *will* concede. All you have to do is provide concrete use cases (existing cases in old code count), show value, address concerns and issues I point out, and make a strong case for what you want. Easy. ;^) 

<pedantic rant redacted>

Where you suggest `append/part buffer tail b -2` my first instinct was this:
```
last-part: func [
	"Return the last N items from a series"
	series [series!]
	count [integer!]
][
	copy skip tail series negate count
]
append buffer last-part b 2
```
But wait! `Last` is a mezzanine function! It could support `/part` directly. Complicates it a bit though, given `tuple!` support there. Has anyone ever used `last` on a tuple? I don't think I have, and would vote to remove it unless someone has a good use case. I can't think of any. That leads me to this:
```
last: func [
	"Returns the last value(s) in a series."
	series [series!]
	/part "Specify a number of values."
		length [number!] 
][
	either part [
		copy skip tail series negate length
	][
		pick series length? series
	]
]
b: [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]
print last b
print last/part b 1
print last/part b 2
print last/part b 10
print last/part b 11
print last/part b 0
print last/part b -1
```
And your example becomes: `append buffer last/part b 2`, which I think expresses the intent much more clearly *and* makes it so you don't have to remember or research the details of how negative parts work; but I hope everyone will weigh in on that. Which do you all prefer?
```
A) append/part buffer tail b -2
; or
B) append buffer last/part b 2
```

Yes, that was my original suggestion. 

I also found very few cases of `append/part`, mostly in Boris' code, but a couple in the JSON codec. I doubt it will go away, as an optimization, and may be used more over time. People just have to watch the implied `copy`, and know when you use an explicit `copy/deep` if needed.

@hiiamboris agreed on positional symmetry. Though I do remember some chat in the past about `copy/part p2 p1` returning the values reversed. No to that.

`take/last/part` does almost the same, but also removes. How do we deduplicate the logic?

`take/copy` are the final stage, after finding the position. `last/part` could just return the position, leaving the `copy` to the user. But that makes it quite different from `last` (I do have an old `at-last` func which did return the `back tail` position).

We have big picture questions, and small ones. `Part` is big. `Last/part` is small. Just a matter of whether it's useful enough to be standard.

Initially thought that's all, but as you asked, looked further. First thing I tried was `load/part s: "wordstop" find s "stop"` and BOOM! error!: *"zero? does not allow string! for its value argument"* Looking at `load` source I saw that cases for part should be switched, so that `zero?` is checked only after `string?` is cheked. Changed, tried again, and BOOM! next error! *"transcode/part does not allow string! for its length argument"*. Checked, indeed, `transcode` allows only `integer!` and `binary!` for `length`. So, **there is no way currently for `load/part` to have `string!` as `length`**. Changed `load`'s code for `part` from
```

Coming from red/chit-chat. Thoughts on `slice`:

On `slice` ... so many thoughts.

- My old [R2 bounds+range](https://gist.github.com/greggirwin/20f11d27bfe8a46075a09264a179f7d1) I was going to do a Red port, but missing `for`, thought about `new-for/new-loop`, and got distracted.

@toomasv did a much more advanced version, but I only have it locally. Toomas, did you ever put it in a repo or gist? It's quite complex, so probably more than I'd want to include, but worth looking at.

It doesn't need to be an `op!`, it doesn't need to be new special syntax. If someone wants laziness and infinite generators, that's nice to think about but not worth complicating the simple and common use cases too much.

It lines up a bit with [step](https://gist.github.com/greggirwin/1f8c1a7f59b4d47cefd9267ae0ccb0af) and a new `loop/repeat` interface. That will be a tough sell, but `for`, as I've learned, is not a good word (we're just used to it, and `foreach` too).

For me, this space is almost like Carl looking for universal path notation, and where that led.

It's also about identifying the core pieces, general cases, and what is built on top of those and specialized. e.g. in R2 `forall` is a special case of `forskip`, with a skip size of 1. So the entire body of `forall` is `throw-on-error [forskip :word 1 body]`. But there is a cost. Red's `forall` is ~8x faster than R2's *if no work is done in the body*. Do just a small amount of work in the body and that dwarfs the loop overhead.

I don't know if that's the case @hiiamboris. Yes, *we* may think our ways are more elegant, or less work overall, but we all view things differently. In Python, for example, everyone's code looks mostly the same. Is that good or bad? In Red, all bets are off, because it's so flexible. That doesn't mean boring, imperative code is bad, just different. In some cases maybe much better. Our challenge is that we can't be *just* Haskell or Clojure, used by advanced devs. Nor can we be *just* VB, COBOL, or PHP.

JS, for all its faults, is dominant in many ways. There are people doing advanced things with it, but the vast majority of users are probably (I don't have stats to hand, if they even exist) writing quite dull, line of business stuff for the web. That daily grind of code may depend heavily on the few advanced users writing deep code, but it has to be exposed in a way that more people can use and understand, without blowing their foot off too often.

You are right that some people my struggle or drop Red over time. But another real possibility is that they will find Red, be intimidated, and never find the joy of what if offers, which they can use on their terms, not ours.

My work is MS-Access and VBA (almost 20 years). Learned by my self. No study. No course. No certification. Read a lot. Books, later internet. But Access fit my needs from the first second. I am a "data man". Started with MS-Works, big spreadsheets. Difficult to handle. For me MS-Access was my solution. Because after very short time I knew the goals.

Red is an open project which is being built every day. I have a couple of objects that will let you work on elements as a database that I am certain you will enjoy once released. Documentation is sparse but if you will used the Rebol manual and also the consolle to experiment, you will master it.

Don't know. Like - animation goes separately, as well as draw. But that does not make sense. But I can find the need to use `draw anim`incorrect. Then draw block itself should contain an animation block. E.g. you might want to animate only certain elements.

Here's why we should NOT make animation part of Draw itself.

Part of what I want for Spaces is dynamic layouts. Imagine you rotate your android 90 degrees and every UI item starts moving into a new geometry (place + size). Not necessarily linearly but e.g. via rotational movement. Then you may rotate your device back again in the middle of the animation and it will also stop at once and start animating back into original geometry. 

That movement can be facilitated by an external mechanism, like `animate`. I designed so UI core would not need to be bloated with these details. All spaces will automatically adapt their display based on size, e.g. turn from text into icons upon reaching some size threshold. 

Right now the only thing helpful to me in animation DSL is `tween` func. It's written too inefficiently for me to use it instead of writing my own 3 lines version, but that can be improved. But later I will push for creating a general animation pipeline exposed to the programmer, so I would be able to use just explain it what I need animated and how and let it do the rest. Fancy FX should then leverage this pipeline. 

My point is I don't want to be locked inside Draw, as it seriously limits the possibilities.

Another consideration is the amount of effort it will take to extend the low-level Draw code versus performance improvements that we might not even need.

Thanks for your comments @pekr and @hiiamboris. I'm not so experienced programmer and that's  visible in my code and design choices I've made.  All that you say means that I have much yet to learn.

> I can imagine having it like this base 100x100 red draw [code here] animate [code here] effect [code here]. Is there a problem having a separate draw and animation code segments? 

Right now one can only use set-words in draw before the commands and not before the parameters. How we will reference the parameters needed to be animated? In `animate` I keep track of the target draw command and the offset of the parameter in the draw block (something like translate5/2) and feed them  to `tween` function. If `animate` is separated from `draw`,  now you need to count the words by yourself. (but maybe I'm too deeply preoccupied with my approach).

This is why we want to get `animate` out for wider comment. It's an exploratory piece that I asked @GalenIvanov to pursue for that reason.

We know from experience that even a deeply talented creator like Carl, given infinite time, will produce imperfect designs. What I hope we can do with Red going forward, is find a balance where 1) A working foundation is laid enough for comment. 2) We revise that based on actual use and input from more than just a single designer. 3) The time comes to lock down a design, no matter how much we want to keep tweaking it, and it becomes "stable". 

This is a tough sell, because both some of the team and some users want things frozen and perfect upon release. Others feel we need to build momentum and be willing to make mistakes and fix them, because we can't predict the future and stagnation means death.

Coming from red/bugs on error handling in codecs.

@rebolek do you think codecs should work differently, as far as errors, based on whether they're standard or not? I don't have an answer myself, since I haven't thought what all might be done as a codec. That's why I suggest making a plan and documenting it.

Today you can use `/as` on a PNG file, but spec `jpeg` or `bmp` and not get an error? You can also chop data out of a PNG and it still doesn't error. You get back an image with bad data. Is that because of PNG's format, or the decoder's choice?

Structured data *may* be a different story, but also depends on the use case. HTML can be viewed as strictly correct, but we all know browsers are very forgiving of errors. In CSV, one record being malformed doesn't affect others. In JSON or XML, one bad element/record/object/value in a serial list of thousands isn't as important as when that element is a top level structure. If we do streaming codecs, users can propagate errors how they want, but there is still the issue of what error system they counter during the loading process.

Personally, I don't know right now if it's best to be completely consistent, or if it's better to tailor the approach to the type and context. I'll guess that there's no single answer, or it would have been agreed upon by now. Just design choices.

@greggirwin 
> do you think codecs should work differently, as far as errors

no, I think they should work the same, that's why I think they shouldn't throw `user error` but a different one.

> You get back an image with bad data.

IMO you should get an error. It's easy to test for valid PNG.

> Structured data may be a different story.

Expecting strictly correct HTML is naive. Browsers are rather forgiving because the net is full of incorrect HTMLs. It's easier to expect correct JSONs and XMLs as they're usually generated by a machine. CSV---you can't expect much from CSV.

It‚Äôs "user code" - not a standard error, but an error created by user. And because codecs are now part of main distro, their errors shouldn‚Äôt be user error, IMO.

@ldci  - Yes I see what you were trying to do there.  I know zero about Swift so wasn't sure what was happening.  It looks like it is below 40 lines of code. But more importantly (as I start to do some comparisons with other languages) is the "cognitive load" that the language puts on the programmer.

@Oldes using refinements is having an alternate words rapresentation for convenience. I have thought about having this "side domain" when creating parse dialects to avoid lowering the namespace of each wordlike datatype. I like the idea but I would prefer having another wordlike type to use in such situation to avoid conflicts that could arise composing and joining. Actually red does not support objects and paths in VID dialect but later it could amd composing and joining could become a nightmare.

Hi guys. My English is not a top notch and sometimes there are some words, which sound strange to me, but maybe other find them quite ok. One of those words is `wrote`, when I look into an IO branch.

True...We're seeing a similar thing (at least where I am) wth vegan food.

Even just five years ago fast-ish food having a vegan option was unheard of - after all, there were way too few wanting it to make it worth while.

But now there's been a phase change - most places have a choice of vegan options. The math now is that a significant number of parties of three or more diners include at least one vegan; attracting those parties is suddenly essential business practice.

And, as you say Petr, even the smallest group we deploy software to is likely to contain a Mac user.

Yeah, I think it's more complicated. It's probably necessary to look at individual market areas. For instance, Go seems really popular in the area of cloud services, and I think Red could compete well with it. Both offer small self-contained native executables, but Red would be a higher-level option. But if you look at developers working on that stuff, even though it's close to 100% Linux as the target, I wouldn't be surprised if 50% of those developers are working on a Mac. I don't know if the ability to run natively vs in a container would be a deal breaker or not, but it's an interesting question. There are probably other things like tooling that are also blockers for that demographic. I just wanted to give another example.

@zentrog:matrix.org I agree, a lot of devs I know are working on mac/Linux and targeting Linux (as a server platform). On the question of container vs native: this is a complicated question. A lot of people are now running everything in a container, so 32bit shouldn't be a problem theoretically, however, there would need to be first-class support for such a container. Which Red doesn't have.

There are a lot of Mac-based developers. The Mac dev platform offers the following advantages:  

1) the OS is much less troublesome from a tech support point of view.  People have fewer problems.  One typically doesn't wrestle with driver updates on the mac, and it is simpler esp. for non technical staffers  
2) if you develop on the mac, you can use VMware Fusion, and run a sub-window with Linux, and a subwindow for Windows, all with drag and drop / file sharing.  Way more convenient than running multiple machines with a KVM.  You cannot run a Mac inside a windows machine (legally), nor can you run Mac inside Linux.  So the Mac is the only dev platform that lets you test all 3 desktop realms in one box.  

Macs are also cheap; i use a Mac Mini, and it allows you to have your favorite keyboard, mouse, and display. Yes their laptops are horribly expensive and difficult to repair. But the Mac Mini is a winner for stationary developers like me who can't live without a 32 inch monitor and  an ergonomic keyboard.

To be honest (I have been an IT consultant in Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Poland) most of the modern IT teams were 100% mac-based. The speed of M1 is incredible. 9hours on a battery, no fans, speed which you can compare with i7/i9. For the IT managers, it is a safe choice...one standard, one system.

According to this chart, OSX has been holding steady at around 16% worldwide for the past year. Windows is between 73-76%, and Linux is between 2-3% (not counting ChromeOS which is also basically Linux): https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide/

We appreciate the input, but none of this is news to us. When we talk about market share and how Red may be used, what *developers* use is only one piece. What do they deploy on? What do businesses run on? Even that is only one piece, right? Because there is business use, and there is direct consumer use. That's changed a lot, and now "Applications" need to be "apps". Those need to run on different OSs than developers use. So it's a similar problem to developing on Mac and deploying on Linux, or developing on Linux and deploying on Android. And then there's Windows. 

So who should we target? If our goal is sustainability (and it is), what gives us the best ROI? Adoption doesn't help unless it also brings revenue. We have to grow by magnitudes upon magnitudes to be mainstream and considered an option against established languages. And if you think that more people mean more contributors, I'm afraid that's wishful thinking. We'll get some, sure, but we'll also get that many more tickets if Red isn't solid on any given platform, because we've spread ourselves too thin. 

Why don't we have Android or IOS devs clamoring for Red? Is it because you can't actually develop on thost platforms? Yes, I know some tools try, but how limited are they? Does that mean people don't want a better way to build IOS and Android apps, of course not.

Back to Mac. If we have full GUI support, will people use it, and can they sell desktop mac apps in a way that helps Red? Or do they use XCode and Swift today, so we need to target IOS as well to be a viable option? Perhaps they're using their Mac as a Shiny Unix (not an insult), and deploying to Linux. And why *hasn't* Linux won? It has, of course, but not on the desktop. It won on servers because it's "free". Not entirely, but that definitely played a big part.

@m_a_j_ch_rz_a_k_twitter, in your work, is the Mac stuff all used in house? What do most project typically deploy against?

The key question, as always, is: what gives us the best chance of becoming sustainable?

1) Ease of use  2) Ease of use  3) Marketing.

By "Ease of use" I don't mean how a GUI works, but how easy it is, overall, to get a system up and running, maintain it, install programs, etc. The next evolution of this was phones, where you don't have a choice about anything, apps are limited in their functionality (back to no dev capabilities), and people trust that if it's on an app store they can install it, it will run, and not mess up anything else on their phone.

There will always be some people who want to customize, tinker, and understand their "machines", but most people just want them to work. Analogize it with cars. It used to be that you *had to* know certain things, or it benefitted you more, to maintain it. Now you really can't maintain a modern car without expensive and specialized equipment. No longer just a spark plug wrench, gapping tool, and a few things to change the oil. But that's OK because you have quick change oil places on every corner. Those places, and dealers, understand that oil changes are bait for more services, even if they themselves are expensive.

Right, but XML (and xhtml) are strict, correct? JSON has a very specific grammar data must conform to, but how to behave when it doesn't is left up to handlers. Other formats have similar questions. What's good for one isn't necessarily best for others, or even having a single rule for all cases of a particular format's handling.

The basic question is to error or not, but then we also need to ask if partial data that's valid should ever be returned. This leads to easy vs hard use cases. The easy things and happy path should be dead simple. If you need things like partial data (which some cases will require), there needs to be either a switch or alternative streaming decoders, like SAX for XML.

That will be a challenge‚Äîthere are only a handful of different auth flows but even then the options for different services are handled in different ways.

The other part that is helpful for auth flow is a lightweight HTTPD service‚Äîfor me that was a motivation for my HTTPD scheme (for R2/R3) and how I'd suggest anyone handle it now*. Although you can do OOB with some services or use an HTTP/HTML client (Ì†ΩÌ∏¨)

*also a good reason for delineating basic HTTPD from file-based WebServers

The opposite is not possible: published code keeps the freedom you have already given and you can't remove it from anyone who is using that released code (as far I know).

### [Spaces](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces) have automatic sizing now.

To test and demo I mocked up the [easings.net](https://easings.net/#) layout, which seemed quite tricky and at the same time, logical:
![](https://s7.gifyu.com/images/GIF-29-Apr-22-21-59-52.gif)

Source [here](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces/src/branch/master/tests/resize-test.red)

Of course layout itself is generative. But sizing is done simply by [switching the minimum width of each triple](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces/src/commit/0ea3951cdc09f8d810033c6178e7ef81dd3ce8ef/tests/resize-test.red#L138) when window size changes.

Base64 is a standard. Base58 has an IETF draft. Is Base64url standardized or doc'd anywhere? I hadn't heard of it before, so don't know how much agreement there is on it, or if we say "It's URL safe", do half the users complain that it doesn't map correctly to their uses.

Cool. All it should take is new tables in %binary.reds and a switch to those if the URL version is used. But as @rebolek notes, it's a simple replace. If it's a must for HTTP, it makes sense to include, but also easy to wrap with mezz's in the meantime. My thinking here is that `enbase/base <data> '64url` means other changes as well, making the `base` arg not just a radix integer, and that expression isn't as clear as `to-base-64-url <data>` or something like it. So wrapping it isn't bad in any case.

Dang, so base64 is kind of a mess like other things. e.g. IMAP. My gut says it's worth including as standard, as mezz is fine, because having it be both URL and filename safe has benefits. Not perfect though, since you can't encode an entire URL with scheme into a Windows filename.

I mean that if I have to `DO` a block with 100 words, and I have to bind it to a context, all 100 word are checked for rebinding. If you create a way to connect the block to the context you want to bind, you could check this context only when you encounter a word. Then if you find it, you take the value from the virtual context anche change the binding of the word to it, otherwise you check for the word on `system/words`

Bad news is https://github.com/red/red/issues/5130 and probably other memory leaks slow it down and even cause random View heisenbugs to pop up, so constantly updating your layout like I do in my demo is not an option. 

Spaces will cache everything that's possible to cache and will not initiate a redraw unless something changed, so programs with more or less static layouts should be possible to write already.

For example, the above demo slowed down in ~1 minute from 60 to 10 fps and started to trigger errors somewhere inside View code which I reproduced 2-3 times and then never again.

Spaces will cache everything that's possible to cache and will not initiate a redraw unless something changed, so programs with more or less static layouts should be possible to write already.

greggirwin (Gregg Irwin): Humans are supposed to be the most sensitive to green, though I don't know if that explains why it appears that way. Usually that means using more bits for it because we are able to discern more greens. If you want more color inspiration, there are [palette generators](https://colorhunt.co/palettes/dark) too

But displays should be calibrated so that blue is actually brighter, but is perceived equally bright as green at 255 level. Simple explanation could be the "night mode" that dims the blue color.

@hiiamboris thanks. The note about the cache is interesting - is that Red or R/S level though? I do remember Cyphre (old time Rebol guru, bringing AGG to R2) stating, that caching or even te ability to create a snapshot at certain node level would be useful. But not sure snapshots are all that useful with Draw, it might be mostly useful for bitmap stuff, when you know that the area did not change since the last redraw, so you don't need to redraw each displayed element .... or something like that :-)

[9:25:20](#kkgiF_K8UhpdaduoYhtBkvbHNuKahX1Y5HKQxVaXZ84) <hiiamboris (NOT THIS ONE)>:
Spaces are 100% pure Red. No RS. To understand why caching makes sense, for example tube-test.red contains circa 8000 spaces, and when you're just scrolling it, there is no need to redraw them all. By caching draw code of the list that integrates them all, resources are saved. Still about 8 fps only, but that's 99% due to the mentioned ownership system bug.

Can't find any notes, but IIRC the change was because of this behavior in R2.

You get around this with `construct`.
Red:
```
>> construct [a: 22 b: b]
== make object! [
    a: 22
    b: 'b

```
R2:
```
>> probe construct [a: 22 b: b]
make object! [
    a: 22
    b: 'b

```
But now you have this in R2:
```

>> type? get in o 'b
== word!
>> o: construct [a: 22 b: 'b]
>> type? get in o 'b
== word!
>> body-of o
== [a: 22 b: b]

I don't see a perfect solution, just choices. The best we may be able to do is to have `body-of` work like R2 and implement `spec-of` for objects to return a `make`able spec.

I think that this is not a correct behaviour of REBOL2:

```
>> type? get in construct [a: 22 b: 'c] 'b
== word!
```

Construct does not reduce, so the implementation is wrong. 

While RED act correctly:
```
>> type? get in construct [a: 22 b: 'c] 'b
== lit-word!
```

But this: [a: 22 b: 'c] is a block for `construct`, not for `make object!`
This is a block for it: [a: 33 b: quote 'c]

So we have NO BLOCK RETURNED for `make` syntax, just for `construct` syntax

L10N/I18N comes to bite many things, as @hiiamboris notes. It's appealing in a narrow view, but this is what high level dialects and interfaces can also handle.

@ALANVF use a translator to convert `1:00pm` to other langs. Is it universally the same? We *do* want to be as expressive as possible, but also have to weigh the options and consider lexical space. e.g. if we add `units` to Red, should they use path format, or just a <number><unit> syntax? Could there then be a conflict of another quantity type for `1p`? 

It's often a fine and blurry line between convenience and value.

What we have to ask is where the value lies. In this case, does it help to be able to write `1:00pm` in *Red data*, if it's only going to be normalized anyway? Sometimes yes, as in config files we give to users. But is time always local, or do we need to account for the machine or recipient's timezone? Is it still a win there, when maybe the recipient uses a different locale?

I think that current version may be more useful.. it allows to select from flat blocks not just by first column... this can be used to select third value according the key in the second column:
```
>> select/skip next [a a x  b b y  c c z] 'b 3
== y
```
In R2 it would return a block with a value _from the next row_

One limitation I deliberately left is the mandatory declaration of `host` face on which spaces are rendered. My previous idea was to replace constructs like `host [vlist [...]]` with just `vlist [...]` but given general incompatibility of VID and VID/S one may write `VID/S` facets after `vlist [...]` in VID and get confused why it doesn't work. So `host` stays as an explicit portal from VID into VID/S.

Special case semantics in order to support formatting preferences is probably not something we want to do. I get it though, because I want things to line up and we still have religious wars in tabs vs spaces.

See, now you're jumping too quickly. ;^) We *could* argue that any empty rule is not allowed. Or we can say that the design of `parse` is that an empty rule matches like it does now, and that's OK too. Feel free to make the explicit `none` rule a wish ticket. What you're proposing, though, is an *exception* strictly for formatting purposes, which is not something we want to do.

Use case is e.g. short circuiting some condition block when composing it. E.g. if first condition is known to always succeed. But I just made that up.

Another interesting discovery today:

Rebol:
```
a: [b c]
get 'a/b

** Script Error: get expected word argument of type: any-word object none
** Where: halt-view
** Near: get 'a/b

a: make object! [b: 'c]
get 'a/b

** Script Error: get expected word argument of type: any-word object none

Red

```
a: [b c]
get 'a/b
== c

a: make object! [b: 'c]
get 'a/b
== c

So, in Red you can `get`  path while in Rebol you must use `do`

```
a: [b c]
get 'a/c

Returning `none` for non-existent keys is always a tricky choice. Red decided to expand that behavior, because you still have the option to check if keys exist, e.g. using `in` for objects or `find` for series. `Find` was extended to maps, which returns the key, so it could do the same for objects. I'm all for `exists?` being a mezzanine, so it's easier to play with in this regrard, but `find` on objects seems enough for now.

Oh, yes, the file system is the real turtle if the path belongs to a file. But I don't know internally how many steps and code `exists?` would take to decode the path to the context it points or to the destination of other series.

@GiuseppeChillemi @toomasv  Thanks that was cool to see and read about!  Random Unasked for Ideas: Tie the "Next" button function to the scrollbar instead and have it fire when its near the bottom? How much to keep loaded for back scrolling? Make loaded row count decisions based on predefined memory amount? Will appending new rows and deleting previous rows cause pauses in GUI rendering? 
Next Cool Feature: A text window that allows Red or DSL to interact with data in the cells and then send a write to the data source ??? :D:D:D  
@greggirwin What about synopsis articles about what folks are doing with Red, or even just Titles that are links to conversation sections like @GiuseppeChillemi sent me? The Synopsis articles could be written by the folks working a particular project and just given a review?

There are many aspects to this, some of which relate to my own limitations and choices. Every day is a new list of choices to make, best guesses at priorities, and what feels like it will be the best use of our (in this case my) time. Perhaps most honestly, it's what I can and can't make myself do, or how I do it. Ask almost anyone here and they'll say "Gregg rarely gives a short answer." :^) This applies to blog posts too. The logical part of my brain understands that short, snappy articles are what people want, and pictures too. But my wetware CPU is very inefficient when it comes to context switching. I could go on at length, but will stop here, at 1/10th of what I would normally write.

I have another proposal. I am starting to use generic paths, where you have `get-word` inside them.  When I need part of the data structure, I simply change the corresponding word value. 

```
table-configuration: [
   a [size: 40x100 type: 'box color: 'red]
   b [size: 40x100 type: 'box color: 'red]
   c [size: 40x100 type: 'box color: 'red]
]
```

I use this form to read the data:

```
value: table-configuration/:column-name/:property
```

Now, I am finding myself reusing paths very often and moving them around. So I have created a container block where I select them. They will need to be copied and rebound.

```
my-paths: [read-property 'table-configuration/:column-name/:property]
```

But BIND does not accept paths, despite they are a series of words. You need to convert to block, rebind and convert to path again.

```
ctx: make object! [column-name: 'a property: quote size:]
get-safe to-path bind copy to-block my-paths/read-property ctx
```

It would be nice to express:

```
pt: copy my-paths/read-property
ctx: make object! [column-name: 'a property: quote size:]
bind pt ctx

```
get-safe pt ctx
```

So, if I have to process all columns for a value:

```
columns: words-of ctx

Hi there. I was just reading the December blog post, with a large section on how there are too many libraries for small tasks (YES!) and then tripped over this casual comment: "The problem I see is that the trend has become for everything to be outsourced [to libraries], including simple features like logging".

Now, previously, after a ridiculous log4j bug swept panic through the Java programming industry a while back, I thought to myself  "Why does log4j even exist? Why do you need a library for something so simple?" but then I thought through all the different concerns we had to deal with for logging (with filename formats, filesystem issues, optional pre-existence of files, file size limits with rollover changing the filename, etc) and thought "actually I'm underestimating how fiddly and error prone it would be to do this from scratch each time. I would definitely want to use a simple library for this". 

Please tell me that I was wrong and that you wizards have managed to tame that kind of fiddly, error-prone task to the point that you don't need a library! I'd love to see examples.

@dukereg:matrix.org you're not missing anything. First, there is simple logging, and then there is *LOGGING*. The latter is filled with lots of decisions and questions (log4j, as an end-game example, is ~30M and ~4K files). The former has just a few questions, and what should be a small number of moving parts. It doesn't mean a standard logging system will do *everything*, but it should cover a lot of use cases, so maybe 90% of projects can use it and not need something else. Those other libs can and *should* exist eventually. 

I have an old logging lib that is 6kb. It was designed for a specific need. Apps that need 3 basic logs: startup, session, and error. Here's an excerpt from its test suite:
```
log-tags-are-dirs
nest-log-dirs-by 'month
set-max-log-size 50'000
LOG_SIZE_CHECK_INTERVAL: 250    ; since our log size is small.

set-base-log-dir %/d/_logging-lib-test/tag-dir-logs/

start-startup-log

prn-log "Starting up..."
prn-log "Step 2..."
prn-log "Startup complete..."

start-session-log

turn-logging off
repeat i 10 [
    prn-log ["NO Session entry" i]
]
turn-logging on

; This should rotate us into 4 logs with a 50K limit.
repeat i 5'000 [
    prn-log ["Session entry" i]
]
```

`log-tags-are-dirs` sets the config so session/startup/error logs each go into separate dirs. `nest-log-dirs-by 'month` can use `day/month/year` as an arg, to control dir size. The rest should be self-explanatory. Internally, all it does is use an ISO8601 naming system for the dirs and files, and handles names and size-based rollover.

So we start with something like that and ask "What else does it need to be generalized?" Can it be opaque to content? Can we redirect to things other than files? Do we use an observer pattern for that? Can we safely target APIs for logging before those are async? You really don't want your app pausing because your network is slow. Should it be a daemon using IPC to avoid that?

But if we do *something*, just this simple, how far does it get us, and avoid third party library explosions.

`Money! * time!` seems like a very useful feature, and I remember this coming up in the R2 days. It just needs to be a clear semantic choice, because `time!` when converted to an atomic numeric value (integer or float) is seconds-based. I just tried this, expecting an error, but it works too:
```
>> to percent! 1:0:0
== 360000%
```
That makes no sense, and I think it should cause an error, but this is useful:
```
>> 1:0:0 * 50%
== 0:30:00
```
So there are some actions where we have to weigh what makes sense to people and what makes for a completely consistently and logical language. Those are less usable in general, because we are human after all. But it *is* a balancing act. @meijeru is one of the most well-versed in the area of consistency, helping to keep us in check. I'd like to hear his view on `money!/time!` math.

My quick thoughts right now:

1) Money-time math is based on hours: `$5 * 1:30:0 == $7.50`
2) You can't `add/subtract`
3) You can `multiply`
4) You can divide money by time, resulting in money (an hourly rate): `$100 / 4:0:0 == $25`
5) Dividing time by money could either be disallowed, or could *also* return an hourly rate: `4:0:0 / $100 == $25` That makes for some funny  thinking mathematically, so we have to ask how useful it is and what problems it could cause. If we disallow it now, we can allow it later without breaking code, so that my suggestion. It only limits how people write the expression. If we don't see any problems with it, I'm also OK with saying that's the behavior, and the added value is worth it. That's why we have all these types, so we can leverage them.

I was invoked by @greggirwin on money/time math. Whatever we allow, it can only be with ONE choice of "unit" for time. I agree with point 1). It comes down to an implicit conversion of time! to float! dividing the time! value by 1:00:00. With that being understood, I also agree with 2) 3) and 4) and with @hiiamboris on disallowing 5), because these follow logically from the notion of implicit conversion.

I was thinking, is there a system to determine the resulting type of a math expression?

Guessing, some types take priority over others, but on the same priority the 1st argument type wins.

[11:13:39](#EqNx3IJiYY7Nc0jOLyPJHZg7MZpZJ8wVZPjA3kJOCnk) <dockimbel>:
Dimensionality of operands should influence priority. Another rule we already use in R/S is that the left operand type dictates the resulting type (or the invalidity of the operation).

@Oldes Others have already answered positively, and I can add that it follows from the notion that there is implied conversion to float! -- since float! * money! is already allowed. It follows also that time! / money! is disallowed like float! / money!.

Where you have `unless none?`, consider just `if`. See how it reads, and where being explicit still has value.

Nice @ALANVF !
A few notes from me too:
- it's interesting that you would bother to `remove back tail title-text` right before calling `unview/all` :)
- title text could be just made reactive for less bookkeeping
- even such simple project like this already yells "why don't we have apply?"
- `either none? found [none][...]` is just `if found [...]`
- I agree with Gregg, usage of `none?` all around is totally unnecessary
- pairs can be accessed as `/1` and `/2`, not just `/x` and `/y` (where X and Y goes against the 2D meaning)
- `with [set-focus self]` is just `focus` in VID
- `found: find-text to-find/text current-pos case-check/data yes(no)` contradicts DRY principle a lot :) need to reevaluate your internal API

## First program written using [Spaces](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces)

### [Red Inspector](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces/src/branch/master/programs/red-inspector.red)

Binaries: [Windows](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces/raw/branch/master/programs/red-inspector.exe) [Linux](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces/raw/branch/master/programs/red-inspector) [Mac 32-bit (untested)](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces/raw/branch/master/programs/red-inspector-mac)

It can inspect system state at any moment, you just:
- run your script as `red-inspector script.red`
- in your script you can call `inspect word` or `inspect some/path` to pause evaluation and look around

GIF demoing it's use on [`example.red` script](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces/src/branch/master/programs/example.red):

UX feedback is welcome btw. 

I'm planning to try to add `console-on-demand` to it on Windows, so it will be able to both give CLI output and won't spawn the "black window" when not asked to.
Also, BS & Alt keys are broken, needs fixing.

But other than that, what would make it more useful?

@greggirwin I am just working with reusable VID panels and dynamically build ones. I am facing limits because I can't `bind/part`, so if I have 2 elements which represent the same data with different content, I am forced to stack content using `append/only` after having bound the data.
Here is a minimal and very simple example:

```
ctx-config: make object! [size: 200x100 display-text: "Hello Word"]

Panel: [
   txt1: text display-text size
   txt2: text display-text size   
   txt3: text display-text size   
]

Bind-part find/match panel quote txt1: find quote txt2: ctx-config
Bind-part find/match panel quote txt2: find quote txt3: make ctx-config [text: "Dear"]
Bind find/match panel quote txt3:  make ctx-config [size: 200x 200 text: "Red Programmers"]
```

Instead I must work as follow:
```
Panel-parts: [
   one [txt1: text display-text size]
   two [txt2: text display-text size]
   three [txt3: text display-text size]
]
panel: copy []

append bind panel-parts/one ctx-config
append bind panel-parts/two make ctx-config [text: "Dear"]
append bind panel-parts/three ctx-config [size: 200x 200 text: "Red Programmers"]
```

It seems easy when you have a couple of elements but try it when you have to assemble a panel with many parts and actors! 

@hiiamboris It is a good proposal but It forces you to replace each `word`, `set-word`,  `lit-word` and `path` you have in a range inside a block. Not the best for speed and to easily search the source of a bug when something goes wrong.

Profiler is the first tool I use to find slow parts of my code. 
I am adding debugger and tracer to my daily work. I have started last month when Toomas created his `Table` Style, so I am porting my code from Rebol to Red. The difficulty I find is that they are very detailed at a low level and I am trying to find a way to not get overwhelmed by such precise information and use them only in specific parts of my code. I would need more aggregated information.

@dockimbel never used the debugger unfortunately. Used tracer and profiler a few times. Tracer is good when it's needed, but too limited by exception handling issues, so the main place where I'm tracing - assertions - still have to be done the other way. 99% of time I'm using my own profiler, for it's much better fit for my needs.

Hey everyone Ì†ΩÌ±ã just getting started on the Red/REBOL ecosystem, coming primarily from a Web background professionally, but doing a lot of systems programming on the side as well. I love LISPs, and I'm getting a lot of the same kind of vibe
A few questions:
- How is the M1 Mac support for Red and REBOL? I haven't found any M1-specific binaries, and not having much success with Rosetta 2 for some reason, getting an error 86 when trying to run the Intel binaries
- Has anyone tried to build Red for WebAssembly? Either browser or WASI runtime compatible? I've seen https://github.com/ALANVF/Red.js but not sure if the focus will ever be on Wasm as a target

[10:22:50](#UyT4RqOxKKcdM7dF_Wmz38pM06oty2LMOxO5ocqtt8c) <jpaquim>:
And a couple of others more tangentially related:
- Looking through the Red website, my inner webdev is constantly screaming a bit at the "classic" Google blogger/blogspot look Ì†ΩÌ∏õ would there be any interest in migrating the content to something like a simple static generator and some styling, or using one of the various documentation generators out there? In terms of usability, I'm mostly missing highlighting on the source code snippets, I think that would make the examples richer and easier to follow
- Is it common in the community to "write your own Red/REBOL", like it is within the various LISPs/Schemes? Is there any existing guide/overview to the main implementations?
Thank you Ì†ΩÌπè

Hi @jpaquim:matrix.org and welcome!

* Current Red is unfortunately 32bit only, so no M1 version yet. There are some plans to move forward but it'ƒë going to take some time.  Red.js is separate implementation, as there is no Wasm emitter from the compiler currently.  But the situation is going to get better hopefully.

Thank you! So I guess developing on a Mac for now requires a 32 bit ARM/x86 Linux VM or similar, right?
Concerning the Wasm target for the compiler, I guess writing something like that would involve something similar to `red/system/targets/IA-32.r` or `ARM.r`, right?

Welcome @jpaquim:matrix.org ! 

Here's the beta site: https://beta.red-lang.org/about/  We haven't pushed to finish it, which is mainly content related, but that's something I'd like to see done. Ping me if you're interested in helping. 

Red's back end can emit anything, as you've seen. Nobody in our team is a WASM expert, so we have to look at the tradeoffs. The reason Red works the way it does today is so it doesn't require *any* other tooling. But that superpower comes with a pretty high cost as well, which is why we're not 64-bit yet. To contribute to the deep core, step one is to see what @dockimbel thinks, and then there will be a *very* high bar for quality acceptance.

We don't have people writing their own variations on the language, but I've always wanted to see teaching projects build micro versions of *other* langs in Red. One of my early `parse` experiments was a little Logo, and it blew me away to see that I could just dynamically add to my rule block to extend the language when the user defined a function.

Red really lets you think about problems in new ways.

Happy Reducing!

I have supposed I could use a block after `/local` thinking it could be ignored because the following code works:

```
x: func [a [string!] /local z []] []

When I have tried to fill the block I have received a strange result:


```
>> x: func [a [string!] /local z [a: 22]] []
*** Script Error: invalid type specifier: a:
*** Where: func
*** Near : []

I have then filled it with a type specification and discovered the local words are parsed as the args. 

```

Shouldn't the parsing of such information stop after `/local`

No, it shouldn't. The func spec only ends at the end of the spec block. Everything *inside* that block is part of the func spec dialect. So we *can* make the rules whatever we want, but the thing to do in this case is to create a new wrapper mezz and experiment there.

Thank you for the link and the detailed answer Ì†ΩÌ∏É
Concerning WebAssembly, it seems like it might be a good gateway towards supporting other architectures and platforms "for free". If you have a Wasm runtime for a given platform, and Red self-hosted and compiling to Wasm, I guess that could always be a quick way of porting Red to another problem (even if not the most efficient possible)

However, I really would like to have subsequent blocks, other than the datatype specifier, that are simply ignored by RED, so you can put inside them whatever you want. But the body of function is free from such constrains, so I can use it to extend the function's specs.

I am just experimenting. My idea was to let the function have knowledge of itself using `spec-of` or `body-of` on `self` but since it is not available in functions,  I have  tried  `spec-of context? 'z`.  
In Rebol2 this does not work properly, `body-of` returns a context instead of the body, and `spec-of` returns `none`
In Red it WORKS and both specs and body are returned:
```

Thanks for your answer Ì†ΩÌπÇ I think that would be feasible, and if I understand Red's implementation correctly, it implements its GC in Red/System itself right? So I'm not sure if it's strictly necessary for Wasm to support the GC-related proposals, as those are mostly related to interfacing with the host system's GC types

R/S to wasm shouldn't be too hard (said another way, not harder than R/S to any other architecture - probably easier than HW ones), and if you do that you can then (probably) compile the Red interpreter to wasm and run it in a browser.

I don't know how much of that would be available from the browser, but there is also a [WASI project](https://wasi.dev/) to develop system APIs for WASM. I think that could eventually be like an open standard bytecode VM. Maybe analogous to node allowing JS on servers.

@meijeru it's unfair to describe IO progress as stalled. I don't know when it's going to be merged to main, but there's a lot of progress on IO. @qtxie did fix a lot of bugs, I have fully working async HTTP(S) scheme and server and also other protocols are in various state of completion as well (Redis, MySQL, MQTT, websockets, ...).

IO branch is fully usable today. I'm not saying there aren't bugs but when I find one, @qtxie usually fixes it in hours, maybe 1-2 days.

So to sum it up, IO is alive and well and I would like to invite others to play with it. If you don't know where to start, just let me know, I'll be happy to help. I am working on a guide how to write schemes, the code is available at https://gitlab.com/rebolek/schemes/-/blob/main/guide/scheme-template.red . I'm not good at documentation but I'm doing my best. If you have any ideas or any questions, just let me know, I'll update the guide so it would be helpful for others.

VID Extension Kit is really quite close to having all that. Overall, I consider REBOL/View in R2 to be the best base architecture for building a highly flexible platform independent UI system. But the core implementation of R2's graphics system is underpowered for it. It is better designed in Red and R3.

HOST is good in that it clearly separates the Spaces "mount point" in a LAYOUT from the actual Spaces-elements themselves.

`Host` is very generic, and also quite heavily used in networking and the `email!` type. The latter isn't a huge issue here IMO, but `spaces` is effectively a style, while `host` could apply to anything.

It will also be a bit confusing to use just `space`, as that may be confused with padding and blank areas. But it does imply that the space is used for something, in this case a container. For path addressing, I think `space` is nice.

To me `span` implies a 1D measure, not an area. Yes, too bad `area` is taken for text, which is something to consider for a future VID change. 

Imagine, in the future, other custom styles do something like `spaces`, perhaps even domain specific. e.g. a media editor that has a preview area, timelines, etc. but you can use its custom layout dialect rather than manipulating facets. Or even just experiments with other layout dialects. What happens with naming then? The question being, does each system use its own name, or does VID get an escape hatch for this? Any system like this will still live inside VID.

I'm actually trying to "sell" VID elsewhere right now, and made these points:

- VID is barebones, but quite trivial to extend.
- The core of VID isn't designed wrong except in a few key places.
- Using a dialect for layout isn't the be-all and end-all of doing GUIs. It's just one way of doing it.
- Large, monolithic widgets is not a way to go, when you have View underneath to serve as LEGO bricks. In my last project, I built a custom table using LIST, BUTTON and SCROLLER. It was fast and easy, because View's features permeate through that design, but you do have to know View and VID to know how to do it.
- View makes it possible to use multiple different GUI engines simultaneously.

Then over the years, things have come to mind:

- Division of labor is important for reducing code complexity. View offers a higher level of abstraction. REBOL's GUI systems start higher up than other GUI systems typically would, and so, makes not only region management super simple, but also styling, events, tip-of-the-spear organization of complex UI elements.
- You don't have to switch design philosophy, when using face trees as you get to the details. A complete hierarchy of UI elements from the outer window to a single character in a syntax highlighted rich text widget can technically be one single path in a face tree. That is taking it very far, too far for performance reasons, but then your instruction set for managing your entire UI to the very last detail becomes well-defined and limited.
- The draw engine used doesn't matter for the design of View, but I understand that many people focus on it, because fast draw engines are sexy. R2's draw engine for View is terribly old fashioned, but still does well. The draw engine is what gives View muscles to perform, but not much else.
- Fixating on dialects for doing layouts ignores the other 95% of the work that UI developers need to do. Too much work is done on The Perfect Dialect. Even Carl did this too.
- Too little work is done on the unsexy part of UIs, which is automated testing options and UI instrumentation for debugging.
- Having numerous functions to manage and navigate a face tree is the core of everything above View. This is the aforementioned instruction set. This should be the majority of GUI engine work rather than building widgets. Extending this instruction set has ramifications for the capabilities of entire GUI engine.
- Teaching people the instruction set to work with the face tree is better than giving them a dialect that will leave the stuck half-way through their project.

Some ideas from my journey in Redbol languages.
As you can't invent too many words and you must reuse them, especially the common ones, a solution could be to specify the dialect you are using.

There are 2 approaches

1) You could specify the dialect of the words, using paths like

`anim/panel`

This forces you to use paths on every word and it is good only for short phrases.

2) You could use a switch, asking  the interpreter to change to one of the sub-dialects like

`switch-DSL anim`

Now all subsequent flow is parsed using the specified DSL, and you avoid specifying the interpreter at each word.

This is an idea I would like to see implemented in Red itself, so when the interpreter finds a `switch-DSL` command, the parsing of the code flow is passed to a new parse-based interpreter, until a `switch-red` is found.

@hiiamboris

You need a solid set of instructions (functions). So far, these functions have more or less been treated as incidental to the goal of an "Uber Dialect" and were only created when the dialect needed it. But, so far the dialect has been for initial creation only, not manipulation. The dialect should be the incidental part for occasional use.

You need instructions for:

- adding/removing/moving/copying/replacing faces and panes
- walking up and down face trees
- searching for faces, backwards and forwards
- filtering for faces to build custom face collections for processing in loops
- setting face flags, so you can treat specific faces as default
- validating face contents
- connecting faces (area vs. scroller, field vs. validator)
- setting face modes for editing or internal content searching
- setting standardized face highlighting for navigation, errors or attention
- switching FEEL objects
- setting layout flow modes and managing a face layout cursor
- disabling/enabling faces
- setting focusing/navigation order
- setting data picker functions
- setting and getting face content recursively
- setting widget skin and face effects
- setting and running face actors
- setting help modes
- setting tool-tips
- configuring face resizing and alignment as well as actual resizing and aligning of faces
- actuating faces remotely via a test controller.

I likely forgot some.

You can do some of this stuff by hand with ```insert face/pane my-face``` and ```make face [blah]```, but there is a ton of maintenance stuff that should be standardized, so that your face tree is always behaving correctly.

Then you build editors and dialects on top of that, or just use the functions directly. You will be spending more time with these functions than with building widgets.

Teach people these instructions rather than just a dialect, and they'll get much farther.

VID fuses the face tree manipulation with LAYOUT, so there is no instruction set. LAYOUT can't change a face tree, only build one.

The rest of its problems that are not in the View core are fairly easy to solve. Overall VID isn't as problematic as it is just basic.

@hiiamboris, because then you don't have to be concerned about state management of the face, you can act recursively in one function call using tree traversal functions and you can set the state without worrying about bugs, and you can build other functions and policies on top of existing functions.

You also don't need to know the internals of a face.

I don't see why setting facets directly should imply bugs and state management, or why that needs any more knowledge of internals than functional abstraction needs knowledge of function names and arguments.

Besides, why functions? Red is not C++. If there really such a need, a dialect would beat functions by a huge margin.

And I disagree that tree walking needs to understand anything about panes. Trees and more generally, arbitrary graphs, should be a language construct with well defined iteration strategies as well as the ability to alter these. They are used in a lot of places, and instead of forcing everyone to reinvent the wheel again, single wheel should fit everyone's need. There's even a [proposal](https://github.com/red/REP/issues/57) with some early sketches on how that may work.

@hiiamboris You need to think much farther ahead and not place the burden of logic on the widgets, but rather on the function set. This is *not* about setting single facets in individual faces.

If you're setting up a face to be validated in a form, the face might contain a piece of validation code that is executed via an accessor. The accessor is run via the ```validate-face``` function and the result is written back to ```validation``` in the face. Then, if ```validate-face``` is run on a validation indication face or a button face, label or a decorative element, that face is just skipped, because it doesn't have that job, and ```validate-face``` knows this.

The validation indication face can show an icon based on the ```validation``` value for the face it's connected to. ```connect-face my-validation-indicator my-field 'validation```. ```connect-face``` knows how to connect faces in pairs for validation, scrolling, sliders, etc., because these are very common connection patterns.

For a form validation of each individual face, you could do ```traverse-face my-form func [face] [validate-face face]```, but ```validate-face my-form``` is fine, because it can traverse faces on its own. ```validate-face``` has now provided information about the state of the entire form and where ```focus-face first find-faces my-form [validation <> 'ok]``` will first focus, if there is a problem.

```focus-face``` incidentally uses ```highlight-face``` to set a standard highlight for the face, if the face can be focused and highlighted, because there are policies for that too!

Now you have something like this:

```
if 'ok <> validate-face my-form [
	focus-face first find-faces my-form [validation <> 'ok]
	disable-face find-face my-form [style = 'ok-button]
]
```

Otherwise, if the form is OK, you can extract the contents: ```if 'ok = validate-face my-form [form-obj: get-face my-form]```, and ```get-face``` uses ```traverse-face``` to assemble an object of all form fields that you can then shove in a database.

In VID Extension Kit the above exists, and that logic is wrapped into the window open/close code, so you don't have to do a single thing other than specify the layout and what constitutes valid or invalid values in the fields. The form is finished and debugged for you. It's also completely transparent, so if your window isn't a form, then the code isn't run.

The reasons for functions and not a dialect should be quite clear in the examples above.

And this is why that part is going to be difficult for you. Rather than spending a long time figuring out a one-size-fits-all native approach, you can write a mezzanine for easy face traversal in a couple of hours, accommodating the design of View.

This is the one in VID Extension Kit:

```
traverse-face: func [
	"Traverses a pane for a face deeply and lets you perform a function on each face."
	face [object!]
	action
	/local func-act last-face
] [
	unless get in face 'pane [exit]
	if all [block? face/pane empty? face/pane] [exit]
	last-face: get-tip-face face
	func-act: func [face] action
	until [
		face: next-face/deep face
		func-act face
		same? last-face face
	]
]
```

That's all you need.

These are the questions that arose while creating a panel builder and  I have only confirmed what you have written: you need to connect other fields linking them, but also to query all fields which have a common identifier, because they belong to a table and they are used to edit its row; or they are field you use to filter it the table and so you need to indicate which is the target table via a linking mechanism.

@henrikmk IMO you're focusing too much on the procedural approach. Either R2 legacy or just a habit. Instead of occupying the mind with "when to run this function" it's more productive to focus on "how are things related". Red solves this much more gracefully with reactivity, however limited and tricky it is.

So my question "how is this better?" stands.

Here's how you could connect form validation with it's (arbitrary) items validation:
```
react compose/only [my-form/valid?: all (bulk/all ['my-form/pane/*/valid?])]
```
This is based on `bulk` design, which is general and not tied to any module or subsystem.

And this procedure:
```
if 'ok <> validate-face my-form [
    focus-face first find-faces my-form [validation <> 'ok]
    disable-face find-face my-form [style = 'ok-button]
]
```
Could look more declarative as:
```
react [ok-button/enabled?: my-form/valid?] 
```
Focusing procedure could also be built upon general designs:
``` 
attempt [focus-face first locate my-form/pane [.. not /valid?]]		Ì†ΩÌ∏â focus-face gets none on valid form, failing `attempt`
```
By the way, VID extension kit is one of the things I dissected for my [HOF work](https://github.com/greggirwin/red-hof/tree/master/code-analysis) so don't dismiss the generality argument as easily.

@qtxie @hiiamboris .Thanks for comments.  GIF packs LZW codes into bytes in LSB-first order. The first code is stored as the 3 least-significant bits of the first byte; the second code as the next 3 bits; and so on. The first 2 codes are thus 100 (clearCode) and 1 (Red color code in table). This correct for this image. Then, data are split into codes (switch to 4-bit groups after reading the highest 3-bit code maxHBit value).  I don't understand why some values are correctly decoded and other not.

"... One of the main reasons is that we have spread our limited resources chasing different objectives while making little progress on the core language. That is not satisfying at all and would bring us most likely to a dead-end as we exhaust our funding..."

"...We need to reach that point in order to *kickstart* a broader adoption and provide us and our users a stable and robust foundation upon which we can build commercial products and services necessary for sustainability..."

You are mixing various things together. My message was completly different. It was upon Carl as a designer releasing product, which was not on parity with the previous generation. That is not the situation of Red, as Red was never there. 64bit version is a Core technology stuff. In many cases though, you can still deal with 32bits, unless you target Mac. Also - noone is taking View away, it is going to be remberged in cca 3 months, according to the plan.

I am not sure how much money e.g. Diagrammar brought to the Red, but I regard it being a distraction. Well, at least I expect lots of GUI related bugs being fixed or View generally improved.

If it would be for me, I would merge IO if complete, Release 0.7 without the planned toolchain changes, and fully focus on 1.0 / 64 bit.

In my (not so) humble opinion... The lack of going "mainstream" was because REBOL was on an island. It had its own self-contained chat, and "worlds". Users didn't interact with the general tech internet, and the general tech internet was largely unaware of REBOL.

The domain I operate in, backend ETL, essentially uses Rebol (Atronix 64-bit) as a microservice architecture pattern language. It excels at this due to its small footprint stand-alone nature. In 10+ years of ETL processing I've transformed billions of rows of data from a large number of Fortune 500 companies. Over that time I've had to deal with Windows server issues, SQL Server bugs, PowerShell quirks, and the occasional script error ... but not a single Rebol bug.

The ability to use something "out of the box" that "just works" and doesn't need constant updates / patches is massive and I've had many discussions with the senior IT folks I engage with about Rebol's central role in processing their data. When clients want to know how a particular aspect of their ETL is setup, we just send them the relevant Rebol script which they find more useful than any documentation we could provide.

I'd love to be able to switch to Red but for that I'd need 64-bit, I/O, and GC. I can see how GUI is important for consumer-level, but for corporate use I'd suggest REBOL/Base (plus call) type functionality is all that's needed.

If you're considering making videos for learning - could the nice animations be written in VID or Draw? then they could be versioned in GitHub, either next to Red or rather in a different repo, but still close by. Surely drawing and animating a few texts, boxes and arrows should be possible, and enough to grasp the different concepts Red brings to the table.

My gut feeling is, that terms like `send` / `receive` (ot their past tenses) would be more imaginable, what is actually happening. Unfortunately, those don't work so well with other port types, like files, sound, crypto, etc.

The word `close` is ambiguous and heavily depends on the context, the query, and the premise before you use it. While `closed` only has a couple of interpretations possible.
If you have an actor `on-closed` means an action to be performed when the connection has been closed, at the end of the event. While `on-close` could mean 1) An action to be performed at the start of the closing event 2) an action to be performed at the END of the closing event. Close is also a verb, other than an event or a state, so you run the command `close port` and you query it for the last event and the port returns `close` you can't say if we are talking about the command issued, the event, or the state without additional words. So I think that we should maintain the difference where `close` is a verb and `closed` is a state. In this ay we can also distinguish between `on-close` when the closing starts and `on-closed` when the port has been closed.

Coming from [this message](https://gitter.im/red/chit-chat?at=62d848ba0a522647985d80d2) in a red/chit-chat thread.

`Spaces` is @hiiamboris' work, which uses something called `VID/S` as it's own interface dialect. Quite some time back there was chat about the value and need for a non-native GUI system. Native GUIs have both strengths and weaknesses, so we had Boris do some experiments. Those went well and he pursued it so that `spaces` now has an enormous amount of effort put into it, and some amazing functionality with exciting future possibilities. But...

Its future is not certain or set at this time. Given the new roadmap, and the current codebase being deprecated as things transition, as I see it, it will be up to the community to use it on their own or not. Any other predictions will be wild guesses because the new View isn't planned until v1.1.

[19:17:40](#W7UqKMYm7xcW4FuuInitqi5m7bGOPZnHawOIZ5lgA5U) <dockimbel>:
People are free to create as many GUI systems for Red as they want. We'll have soon a proper module system and package manager, so users can choose which one they want to use on a per-project basis. Red provides by default a GUI system with native backends, which in the future will be extended to also have a custom cross-platform one. Maybe it will be that one built by @hiiamboris or another one (e.g. implemented as a semi-virtual backend for View), that's certainly not a concern for me until v1.1 as Gregg said.

This is what been implemented in the IO branch. We can change it. IIRC, `wait` will return when `awake` handler return `true` in Rebol 3, right? Is there a reason/use-case why it's needed?

The IO branch was created for testing the R/S level network functions three years ago. Back in that time, I don't know which I/O model (async/await, multi-thread, or just port!) will be used in Red. I use port! to do the test as it's the simplest one. 

For the actions to be used, I don't have preference. Just use what provide by port!.

I didn't remember writting that, so I had to check... Indeed, it's written, but I don't remember really agreeing with that... Maybe someone suggested that to me at that time and it sounded acceptable even if that's stretching the definition. Looking at it now, I don't think it fits well the concept of dialect. Macros are functions that happen to be run before the main script they are defined in, nothing more. You write macros using regular code, not a dialect. The macros use specific definition syntax in order to be extracted more easily from the script code, not in order to serve a domain-specific purpose. 

Though, that's open to discussion if others have pro arguments.

Though, as Gregg says, removing the end checking will result in more infinite loops cases, which can be painful to debug, especially when having a big set of rules. OTOH, once we add the ESC key support to Parse and the interpreter, it should be easier to manage when running code from the console.

[22:14:14](#fQfs0oMf0LFZwQiJyVoMuuYXlk9ZNGDTXa-8uFFRxHY) <dockimbel>:
Putting by mistake an "always matching" rule too early inside a `any/some` body with a set of alternative rules. I also remember often hitting the infinite loop in Parse issue when writting new Parse code in Rebol2, but can't remember when that happened last time in Red.

[22:17:57](#fm9jbpHHX4yX27RQb-jtU_mtdWoX_9m9O4_l3gVOaHY) <dockimbel>:
Just to illustrate that:
```
parse "hello" [any ["h" | skip | (print "other")]]
```
In R2, it's an infinite loop, in Red, it just stops when reaching the input end.

[22:19:11](#7cPRhOWHER-zly5-QUZAAu5g_aSfvdRLJFYwTg87HAE) <dockimbel>:

@meijeru Currently those "modules" are only meant for handling optional parts in the Red runtime. Such optional part can be located anywhere in the codebase. For parts that don't fit anywhere else, we put them in that `%modules/` folder. All that is temporary until we get proper "modules" definition and a module/package manager.

I have done some speed test to understand how the order of datatypes influences the speed of a function.
I have used this code:

```
recycle/off
Probe "Testing Speeds" wait 1
test-func1: func [
	data [object! block! string! number! word!]
] [
	
]
test-func2: func [
	data [word! object! block! string! number!]
] [

Probe s1: dt [loop 10000000 [test-func1 'aword]]
wait 1 
Probe s2: dt [loop 10000000 [test-func2 'aword]]

;s1: to-decimal s1
;s2: to-decimal s2

Print ["Difference: " 100 - ((s1 / s2) * 100)]
```
Having the passed datatype moved from the fifth to the first position, you have an average 7% speed increase.
Here is the result:
```
"Testing Speeds"

0:00:03.57934

Rebol pure loop speed is about 2.8x than Red 1.1 seconds vs Rebol 3 seconds. I suppose it is caused because Red is more powerful than Rebol, having pre-lexer and debugger.

While `GET IN` performance in RED is terrible (compared to REBOL),  RED paths are faster than a `GET WORD!` on a bound `block!` And also are EQUAL to Rebol pure `GET` speed. It seems paths are the most efficient way to get a word value in a context.

[WISH]:
if `read` accepted also string! and binary! by simply passing them as is, instead of:
```
decode: func [text [string! binary! file!]] [
	if file? text [text: read text]
	if binary? text [text: to string! text]

I could write:

@meijeru `load` does not simply `read` a file, that is it does not the same thing.

@dockimbel About `find/deep` I have made some research on the various `find` methods.
I have made 8 tests, each with a different method. 
The first group of 6 tests is made on data organized as a table of  block of blocks.
The last tests are on data organized as single column flat and 5 columns flat, and I have used native `find` and `find/skip` without sub-searching.
There is even a dynamic change to avoid one `get` in `path`

Here is a gist with the [code](https://gist.github.com/GiuseppeChillemi/96790bbfba304e5a9ab346b3a33a5c8d)

Single find or find/skip are always about 25x faster than my code .
I think that implementing sub searching as nested r/s code could maintain a great advantage over interpreted one. I guess even 12x. This would greatly benefit database like operations.

I think that implementing a kind of sub searching as nested r/s code could maintain a great advantage over interpreted one. I guess even 12x. This would greatly benefit database like operations.

* @dockimbel About `find/deep` I have made some research on the various `find` methods.
I have made 8 tests, each with a different method. 
The first group of 6 tests is made on data organized as a table of  block of blocks.

There is even a dynamic change to avoid one `get` in `path`

In any case, you're misusing `find` by giving it an O(n) task over long `n`, and demanding a few times speed increase as if that would matter. You should create and maintain (hash) indexes of your data if you want fast O(1) search over it, if you can't organize it as a single hash.

Yes, I know but in this way, I could measure the real performance of just the `find` code.
I was amazed how `REPEAT` + PATH approach is faster than `FORALL` but I suspected it from the previous tests made some days ago where get/set operation where slower than paths. Also I was amazed how a simple check `all [block? column find column value] is able to halve the speed of the loops.

Yes, I know but in this way, I could measure the real performance of just the `find` code and other loops without intermediaries.

@hiiamboris I have converted all tables to `hash!` and published the results in the gist. Everything is slower using hash! but native `find` and `find/skip` have NO MEASURABLE time at all. The slowing is a natural result as I suppose hash! has a little overhead and it should, and not including block the block content in the `hash!`, you have the overhead head but not the advantage. But on flat data, we are going at the speed of light. Here a snapshot of the result set. All zeroes!

Some notes about image datatype in Red
In REBOL/View 1.3 it was necessary to redesign the image datatype in order to make image
operations more consistent and less system dependent.The image datatype is structured as a standard REBOL series. It has a head, a tail, and can be positioned to any point in-between. In additional, the new image datatype allows two dimensional positioning and sizing through the use of an X Y pair. (http://www.rebol.com/docs/image.html#section-1)

Attention: first pixel coordinate is 0x0 and first pixel index is 1!

In Red, image datatype is a series-like. This means that some series functions are not working.

Making images
img1: make image! reduce [200x100 red]		:--yes
img2: make image! reduce [50x50 green]		;--yes

img3: make image! reduce [50x50 blue 128]	:--no
If you want add transparency on image:
img3: make image! reduce [50x50 blue]
img3/alpha: 128 [0..255] 					;--same value for all pixels
OR
imgSize: 2500 (50x50 pixels)
rgb: 	make binary! 3 * length? imgSize	;--3 bytes/pixel
alpha: 	make binary! 1 * length? imgSize	;--1 byte/pixel
(you need to populate the rgb and alpha channels with byte values)
img3: reduce [imgSize rgb alpha]

Copy images
The COPY function works in the standard way as it does with all series, making an exact
copy of the image provided.

i1: make image! reduce [200x100 red]
i2: copy i1									;--yes
i2: copy/part i1 5x5						;--yes
i2: copy/part skip i1 4x4 5x5				;--yes
i2: copy/part skip i1 2x2 (i1/size - 4x4)	;--yes	

Traversing Images (Indexing)
You can use all the standard series functions to index to any position within an image series. The functions include: HEAD, TAIL, NEXT, BACK, SKIP, AT, and others.

i2: next i2 ; move to next pixel			;--yes
i2: back i2 ; move to prior pixel			;--yes
i2: head i2 ; move to first pixel			:--yes
i2: tail i2 ; move just past the last pixel	;--yes
i2: back tail i2 ; move to the last pixel	;--yes

Modifying Images
Images can be modified in two ways. They can be modified as individual pixels (with poke function) or they can be modified as a series of pixels.

change at img1 1x1 img2						;--yes
change/dup at img1 10x20 blue 40x30			;--no
append img1 img2 ; uses insert				;--no	
remove/part img1 img1/size/x				;--no
remove/part tail img1 negate img1/size/x	;--no	
insert/part img1 blue img1/size/x			;--no

Searching Images
pos: find img1 red							;--no

Image Comparison
The EQUAL?, NOT-EQUAL?, and SAME? series comparison functions work for images in the same way as they do for other series datatypes.

ANDing, ORing, and XORing Images
Partially supported by Red
img1 AND img2								;--no
img1/rgb AND img2/rgb						;--yes

@dockimbel have you considered locking all loaded series to avoid "why do I have to copy" kind of problems?

[12:20:05](#mFxZJV4IWfzfQtc2GB-LSDrk9-FlWAYbDaveJgiQDa4) <dockimbel>:
That would change the fundamental semantics of series and change the language itself. So, no, I haven't.

Many newcomers start with a different mental model built from very different languages, and have issues learning something different.

Let me put it this way. Pointers are a hard to grasp concept for many people, but necessary for performance. I wish we could live without that, but it's not feasible. But having literally loaded data modifiable makes learning even harder. It's not a critique, it's a matter of fact. So we as designers must justify the design with reasoning.

@dockimbel I don't want to necessarily bother you with maybe not so important stuff, though to me even a "cosmetic" things like brackets instead of parens for maps, or `wrote` async event, are kind of important :-) I have created a wish (dunno where exactly though), asking to replace `wrote` by just `write`, from the reasons stated below:
* It came from the R3 async stuff, which never really took-off anyway, so no risk of a compatibility issues
*  We don't use past tense for `connect`, `accept` anyway
* Going even deeper (R/S), I can see both past and present tense ...
* Apart from the priority - is that a change you can imagine would be acceptable?

Design (scenario: all literal series are immutable by default):

Redbol are homoiconic languages. All code is represented as literal series (at least before evaluation, except for literal maps, which are breaking the model). Locking all series on load would break the language, as most of the literal data-structures need to be modified in some ways during the evaluation process. It would prevent binding from working even before wreaking havoc during evaluation. To circumvent that, one would need to invoke copying pretty much everywhere in the interpreter and standard library. It would affect performances and memory usage massively. 

It would be a nightmare also for end users as many actions/natives are modifying in-place, so would require an explicit `copy` everywhere. In order to make it work  without requiring explicit `copy` everywhere, the semantics would need deep changes which would result in a quite different language than Redbol.

Although the more I think about it, the less convinced I become. Certainly not a "quite different language". 

Just literal caches will be affected semantically, e.g. `buffer: clear []` in functions or that /into thingy `reduce/into [...] clear []`. Both can go into an anonymous context or be composed with a created block (we do that anyway when we want a hash! instead). Such cases are rare, and though I value them, but not much.

Console will be affected, but console could go one step further and unlock everything it loads, so no issue there.

Binding is the biggest issue. All context bodies and all function bodies will have to be copied deeply. Quite an overhead, esp. since those copies will overlap many times. But in the grand scale, a few megabytes copied, so what? We won't even notice except for edge cases like creating millions of functions (who does that?).

Load-modify-save cycle is switched to Redbin because otherwise it's too limited. Redbin doesn't have to lock anything. So that is ruled out as well.

And are those few megabytes worth the bugs they cause? I can for example recall a bug when `react` was binding it's paths in place, leading to very hard to debug situations. So don't tell me that pros don't make mistakes Ì†ΩÌ∏â They make more because they write much more code, and often they are caused by refactorings when code was designed for one case but was extended for another.

My point still stands: the user will be baffled by such error. Why do `"hello"` literal string behave differently depending on where I use it? Both strings are literals!

I'd say you're looking for the world of values. Everything there is a value: objects are, functions are, integers are, words, datatypes, plain integers ... These values are values of different "types", a.k.a. datatypes. An unevaluated "function-to-be" is just loaded code in the form of spec and body block values with words and other values in it, evaluating that code makes a value of type function! out of that.

@gurzgri functions and objects, when they are transformed into values, they split from their data rapresentation, it like having a 2 layers world, while blocks and other values seems to have the data firm coinciding with the loaded one. You can modify a function's body and the value remains the same, while it is not the same for block. So it seems functions are made in a secondary "dimension" and I was searching a name for it.

Let's make notes about immutability here: https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BDOC%5D-Red-Should...-(Feature-Wars)

We can argue the technical merits of mutability, but let's start with questions. Those are often easier and save time on work that turns out not to be worth pursuing.

1) Is mutability *proven* to be an improvement for *every* language? No. Here we can say that almost *nothing* is proven in the realm of programming language design, even with the few studies that have been done. Given that it's not proven for every language...

2) Is it a better fit for some languages, given their overall designs (one element of which may be that data is mutable by default)? Sure, but likely because it fits *with* the overall language design and goals. Like static typing, there are costs and benefits.

3) How many people complain about it? Mostly new people or those experienced with the language? Trick question? You get used to things, but sometimes a feature aggravates experienced users even more. Do the same percentage of people using immtuable langs complain that they want to relax things sometimes, or improve performance? Do user leave the language over it, once they get used to it?

4) Is what Redbol langs do now simple to implement and easy to reason about, even if you have to learn the rules? That is: series are mutable and you need to use `copy`. What else is there to learn?

5) Is it a likely improvement, a lateral move, or will it make things worse? All opinion and conjecture, right?

6) If we want to build immutablity-oriented dialects in Red, can we? How hard is that? Just wrap things and `copy` internally, yes? We can even make funcs that have custom specs to copy their mutable args if so denoted. It's also something an analyzer can check and tooling can help with. If we are immutable at the core, how hard is it to go the other way, either at the mezz level or using some unlock/copy-on-write internals? I'll wait while you figure it out. Where is our time best spent?

7) Immutability is the poster child for functional programming (FP). Has FP won? Is it widespread? No, I don't mean trendy with the cool kids. I mean, how much software in the world runs on it, as a percentage? How many people understand it well and use it effectively? OH! You got me! Spreadsheets. Doesn't count here. Important in the grand scheme, at the application and conceptual level, but a constrained paradigm suited for...a dialect. Still, they're data too, and I think people think that seeing a cell change means the cell changed.

8) Is it a good fit for Red? My gut says no, but I have a lot of history and bias. That still counts, as does others' experience. Do those who use Redbol langs develop software effectively? Do we know what *kinds* of systems it's better suited to? Is it likely that some architectures play well with mutability and we can suggest those to people? Yup, a large team working on a monolith wants more guarantees and less trust. A modular system where pieces are potentially ad hoc and done quickly...that's what dynamic, high level languages are for right? To get out of your way.

N) The key question is: WHY WOULD WE DO THIS? The leading reason was `avoid "why do I have to copy" kind of problems?`, but there is no free lunch. You can't ask that question in isolation. Problem X goes away. Problems Y and Z surface to take its place.

N+2) Have I personally been bitten by mutability? If it were a snake, I'd be long dead; but it's not. I've been nipped a lot, and bitten hard a few times. My bias right now is that I'd rather do that than suffer the death by a thousand cuts every time it *wouldn't* have hurt me but I still had to suffer. But it's the Devil I know. For me, mutability fits with Red's overall design as a data oriented language.

You're confusing different concepts. Red data format is the subset of the Red language constituted by all datatypes with a first-class literal format. In addition to being a data format, Red is also a language for doing general computations. In order to achieve that, we add to Red datatypes for "computing" purposes.

Construction syntax was brought in Rebol to solve the lossy _serialization_ roundtrip. It was still missing a lot of information, making it a half-complete solution.

That's my current position as well. I have no intention of extending the scope of current construction syntax for now. Eventually, we might give objects a literal form though. I'm still reluctant on that one (and still have a bad feeling about literal maps) as we keep cluttering the lexical space with new esoteric delimiters.

@dockimbel literal maps are, IMO, a necessary concession because of JSON. The alternative is to provide stricter key-value helpers for blocks in Red, along with guidelines for use from other langs that make them as easy to use alongside straight blocks as JSON is. I think the extra `#` is a small price to pay for adoption.

What JSON did was a) Define a lowest common denominator that was widely useful and relatively easy to parse. b) Got very lucky. :^) We *can* do everything just with blocks, but then more metadata is required to *document* that something is key-value.

I very much doubt that. Such _de facto_ standards like JSON are born out of empirical needs and constraints (needs for servers to send JS data to clients in the easiest way). As web/JS grew up, it became a standard and spread on web API as every other language added support for it. Chances to impose a new standard without that standard being backed by a popular software or hardware solution are dramatically close to zero.

I've been thinking about usage patterns in Redbol and Javascript, and whilst most are simpler to express in Redbol, I find these two common ones much cleaner in JS:

```
s = `x="${x}" y="${y}"`

const sub = {';': ' ', ':': ' '}
s = 'a;b c:d'
s = s.replace(/;|:/g, matched => sub[matched])

I suppose the Redbol equivalents would be:

```
s: ajoin [{x="} x {" y="} y {"}]

s: "a;b c:d"
foreach [a b] [";" " " ":" " "] [replace/all s a b]

@pekr I have read.  A like the idea of having read-only elements when needed, that are protected from modifications. Also this would act as safeguard, when newbie make mistakes like altering series belonging to a function, where they should have been constanct.

@Dobeash Sometimes `foreach replace/all` as you suggest, because it's right there at the keyboard. Sometimes `parse change` thru some kind of wrapper like

```Red

@Dobeash Current `replace` design supports that via:

But I should add that it's suboptimal and the whole `replace` function is a mess patched together by different people, so it can't even do the simple thing it's made for: replace any-type value with any-type value:
```

Hey! I'm trying to get started with red. I'm on windows and I have red.exe, red-view.exe, and red-toolchain.exe. I'm using emacs and I set a keybinding to call red-view on the current file. That's not very ergonomic but I'm not sure how to make it easier. I've been learning web development with clojurescript and that workflow isn't too bad;  I can evaluate one expression and get one result or I can save the file and the whole ui updates. In red, I'd at least like the new window to replace the old one but I'm not sure how to do that. Can anyone share their experience or offer a suggestion?

What would be *more* ergonomic? I think many of us use hot-keys for common tasks.

> In red, I'd at least like the new window to replace the old one but I'm not sure how to do that.

It sounds like you want to behave like a browser, where the page updates with your new code. i.e. hot reloading. Red doesn't work like that. There is no host process that Red UIs run in, other than the OS itself. Every time you run your script, it's a new instance. If you want it to work like a browser, you have do build that yourself. Since you're just starting out, I recommend against that. Get used to Red first.

* Keeping it exceedingly simple would be a start. You might not have full threading, but you could at least run/query/kill background tasks. If multiple tasks write to globals and get into a fight, that's your problem.

Out of my imagination (because I'm not a threading programmer and am very naive about it):

```

For my part, I hope we can build a high level coordination system that
makes it easy to glue things together, because that's still a gap and
major pain point. As soon as you use someone else's code, and we have a package system, low level approaches become nightmares in this realm.

The lines will, and should, blur between elements, but they won't go
away entirely. You may need to know when you're making a local function call versus an IPC cross-process call versus an API call going across the internet. But that doesn't mean those things should all look wildly different or make you jump through different hoops that lead to mistakes.

It may be that maps didn't allow it because of the old behavior for removing items, though that applied to values rather than keys.

I've never used `none` as a key, so my first question is whether that may lead to more subtle bugs because `none` can be produced a number of ways, which would all map to that default key. Next is to ask if it adds enough value over just not having the item in the structure or using a synthetic key.

I don't think there's a correct answer, just choices. I prefer the Red version because:
- it strictly follows the rule: `number-of-segments = 1 + number-of-delimiters", no exceptions, so it's easier to reason about

The associated test produces the same result before and after that change, so I'm not clear on the details yet.

Here's the extract of what `split` does:
```
rule-core: [

	delim
	[end (print 'end-b) keep (make series 0) | none (print 'none)]

series: ","
delim: comma
parse series compose/only [collect any (rule-core)]

```
v

```
v

v

## Deep changes to Spaces

I have committed a few important changes to Spaces. These decisions were not made lightly, but were evaluated for a long time, and now are finally live: 
1. Switched to **single-parent model**, so using the same space in multiple spots on the tree is not a good practice (you'll get a warning if you try that). Though it is a requirement for self-containing grid demos, so not entirely forbidden for foot shooters. Designer's comments [here](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces/src/branch/master/design-cards/single-vs-multiple-parents.md)
2. Where **names** of spaces (as words) were used, now space **objects** are used everywhere (even in paths), and those space objects have a `/type` facet with their style name. Designer's comments [here](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces/src/branch/internalized-name/design-cards/words-or-objects.md)
3. Every space has **type/range checks** now, leveraging [`classy-object`](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-common/src/branch/master/classy-object.red) design. So an attempt to assign to a facet a value not supported by it will raise an error:
```
>> list: make-space 'list []

>> list/size: -1x0
*** User Error: Failed (0x0 +<= size) for pair value: -1x0
*** Where: do
*** Near : do make error! info/2 :new
*** Stack: run on-change-dispatch  

>> list/type: none
*** User Error: Word type can't accept none value: none, only [word!]
*** Where: do
*** Near : do make error! info/2 :new
*** Stack: run on-change-dispatch  
```
4. **Custom** `mold` implementation is used, which I will keep tuning for better debug output. Should you find the output unsatisfying in some cases, please report. Unfortunately, I cannot switch console command output to this new mold, so anything after `==` is still the native `mold`, and `print mold` has to be used instead:
```
>> lt: lay-out-vids [vlist [text "1" text "2"]]
>> render lt/1
>> ?? lt
lt: [list:26x62]       Ì†ΩÌ∏â not an url, but abbreviated space object!
>> ?? lt/1/map
lt/1/map: [text:6x16 [offset 10x10 size 6x16] text:6x16 [offset 10x36 size 6x16]]
>> print mold hittest lt/1 15x15
[list:26x62 15x15 text:6x16 5x5]
```

Risk of breaking changes should be considered much smaller from now on!

3. Every space has **type/range checks** now, leveraging [`classy-object`](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-common/src/branch/master/classy-object.red) design. So an attempt to assign to a facet a value not supported by it will raise an error:
```
>> list: make-space 'list []

>> list/size: -1x0
*** User Error: Failed (0x0 +<= size) for pair value: -1x0
*** Where: do
*** Near : do make error! info/2 :new

>> list/type: none
*** User Error: Word type can't accept none value: none, only [word!]
*** Where: do
*** Near : do make error! info/2 :new
*** Stack: run on-change-dispatch  
```
4. **Custom** `mold` implementation is used, which I will keep tuning for better debug output. Should you find the output unsatisfying in some cases, please report. Unfortunately, I cannot switch console command output to this new mold, so anything after `==` is still the native `mold`, and `print mold` has to be used instead:

```
>> lt: lay-out-vids [vlist [text "1" text "2"]]

lt: [list:26x62]       ;) not an url, but abbreviated space object!

* ## Deep changes to Spaces

I have committed a few important changes to Spaces. These decisions were not made lightly, but were evaluated for a long time, and now are finally live: 
1. Switched to **single-parent model**, so using the same space in multiple spots on the tree is not a good practice (you'll get a warning if you try that). Though it is a requirement for self-containing grid demos, so not entirely forbidden for foot shooters.

Unfortunately, I cannot switch console command output to this new mold, so anything after `==` is still the native `mold`, and `print mold` has to be used instead:

```
>> lt: lay-out-vids [vlist [text "1" text "2"]]
>> render lt/1
>> ?? lt
lt: [list:26x62]       ;) not an url, but abbreviated space object!
>> ?? lt/1/map
lt/1/map: [text:6x16 [offset 10x10 size 6x16] text:6x16 [offset 10x36 size 6x16]]
>> print mold hittest lt/1 15x15
[list:26x62 15x15 text:6x16 5x5]
```
Attempt to `form` a space however will most likely freeze the program, so beware.

Risk of breaking changes should be considered much smaller from now on!

Documentation was updated accordingly.

I went thru some of the Spaces materials over the weekend. It really looks, like you're cooking a next gen system, but I can find the code a bit complicated. 

OK, that's not necessarily for ordinary users to care about, but one aspect I really did not like - the `facet=`syntax .... I can spot code like `=below=: `, or code like `@(m + 1x4)`, `facets: [#align]`- why a hash sign here and not a litword?

FYI, `on-deep-fixes` branch has been merged, here's the changelog:

* Bitset! values can now trigger deep reactions.
* Now compound scalar datatypes (pair!, date!, time!, tuple!) will emit `on-change` events when one of their component is changed using an access path (both in compiled and interpreted code).
* Much safer reactions code static analysis (no more accidentally triggering function calls resulting in hard-to-track bugs).
* Compiled access path! values now trigger proper reactions when needed.
* Compiled access path! values are now correctly reported in errors (no more `none` placeholder).
* Setting a value to a reactor's field will now allow value being rewritten by incoming chain reactions (also improves reactions checking performance).
* Fixes for `on-deep-change` unwanted firing.
* Fixes for `is` registering same reaction twice (resulting in unwanted firing).
* Other reactivity-related fixes.

In Rebol and Red when using bitwise operation on binary, the result has length of the longest series:

I wonder if it would not be more practical to have the result with the shortest length and so just: `#{FF}` in above case.
I don't know if anybody is using it `xor` like that, but I found it practical when working on websocket implementation, where the input must be demasked.. currently I have to remove the additional bytes.

No I'm not in any corner. I think that ideally it could work like @rebolek said. This is my current code:
```
while [not tail? payload][

Thinking out loud.

Bits are not Red values, so semantics are going to be quite different in some cases. Even today, with actions that are supported you have to think about them differently. e.g. appending to a bitset may not change it and, even if it does, the length may not change. Remove has the same issue.

You can index-address bits, though no `foreach`.

[13:45:36](#Qz17Pcv5Z8ruTiG5YmMwD12TdglUBeHMf9f31wgSxr0) <hiiamboris (NOT THIS ONE)>:
Your proposed append/remove behavior is tied to "set" term in "bitset", but if it was a series that *could be treated as a set of bits*, I don't see a problem with insertion/removal, or bits not being values. You can liken it to vectors of `[integer! 2 length]` spec (if they existed).

hello, everyone. I'm an openbsd user and was interested in checking out this language. From my understanding red does not support running on openbsd, but the build from source instructions had information about a rebol interpreter for openbsd, so i thought it was worth the shot. However, it appears that the most recent release of rebol for openbsd was back in openbsd 4.0, which means that openbsd is effectively not able to run rebol from this binary. If there are plans to eventually port the language to openbsd, there will likely be issues from this, unless i'm missing something obvious. Has anyone been working on this or know if there's a way to potentially build rebol from source for a newer version of openbsd?

if you were coding a password strength checker, I assume you would need to isolate the individual characters then determine their character type. NaN? would be a way to check for digits. 

other example would be if you are allowing a user to type any value into a box but it should only accept numbers. leaving it an empty string in this case would be accepted even if the box needed to be filled by a number but you could code you own checker for empty values.

Reading unknown data such as from a database as well could be a use case, or perhaps from some sort of sensor?

Very nice experiment hiiamboris  I've done similar things, where groups of functions data global/context  for implicit and more compact code. Also eliminates using the wrong thing. In this case, how do we make it easier to get things right and document which functions use the `into` buffer stack?

Good point. I guess:
- either documenting that such functions accept `into` buffer, or letting `make` use the buffer, so that would affect all allocating functions
- limiting the scope to the next after `into buffer` expression of the same nesting level (currently only possible by `do/next`ing the code)

Just discovered Red. I started on "Getting Started", and the GUI examples worked straight away. But, to generate a standalone executable, it says to download the Red toolchain binary for your platform, which is macOS.  I can't find this.  It's not there under the macOS heading. At the top of the download page is a big red button saying "Red-view for macOS", but if you click it, you get a 404 Page not found.

I read some more about it and that would mean also implementing HTTP2, TLS and probably other stuff. Lots of work, so perhaps best would be just writing bindings to a *libgrpc*. And I'm not sure if it's possible to call C++ API from our FFI, or does *libgrpc* have a C API. Will investigate more later :-)

IO is more or less ready for prime time, why it's not merged is a question that I cannot answer but I did a lot of testing, I have a webserver that runs fine and gets very high security scores, so IMO, IO is great.

IO: you've got answers in the thead before yours. There's a working version in IO branch, but the API is identical to R3, which is not satisfying. The required changes are minor and mostly in the API (including some Uniserve-like features), but as usual, the devil is in the details. Coding is easy, good design takes time.

64-bit: runtime adaptations have started, to prepare for implementing the new toolchain in Red itself (and drop Rebol2 dependency for good). We did a lot of work on fixing issues, so that the current Red version is significantly more robust compared to last summer version (we still have a few important fixes to make). One of the goals is to have a fast compilation process (compiling the whole runtime library in < 1s). New features are needed for that, among which some form of parallelization support.

Let's say you do have duplicate elements, which is allowed today. If you `select` based on value rather than index, do you always just select the first? Index makes it unambiguous. e.g., how would you do this?

view layout [

	t-2: text-list data ["a" "b" "c" "d"]

As far as *allowing* duplicates, yes, we need to allow that. What you display in the list is not necessarily the only bit of data related to the item.

	object [a: 1 b: 2]
	#(c: 3 d: 4)
	object [d: 1 e: 2]

1) A file manager. Are entries case sensitive? If not, you'll lose filenames that differ only by case on OS's that support that.

2) An data explorer, where each list contains the values and selecting one loads the next list with its contents. Object explorers are a prime example. Red objects and maps, can't have duplicate keys, but can have duplicate values.

3) Blocks can have any kind of dupe, so you couldn't just load them into a list.

4) Maybe you have a block and want to list every N items. i.e. what values are there if I use `/skip N`?

5) Lists of coordinates.

6) Names of people or tags. Search a DB for customers, the list shows <last, first initial>. Only one "Smith, J." shows up, even though you have 5 Johns, 4 Jennies, 3 Joes, 2 Joans, and  a Jorge. Do I have any cameras running in Seattle? Just one.

The DB example made me scratch my head, thanks :)
It raises questions:
1. Do we allow selecting items on this list, or is it purely to show us what's there? For the latter surely duplicates make sense.
2. If we do allow selection, and the list has what looks like duplicates, then do we just expect the user to click on them all and inspect details, to find what he was looking for?
3. Ultimately what looks like duplicate `<last, first initial>`, in the list may be unique data IDs. So, if list contained IDs themselves and the way to visualize them, uniqueness won't be a problem.

For background, these questions initially were raised during drop-down design. Which thru consistency is tied to lists. And for lists I want multi-selection support. 

And there again, if I use indexes (`selected: [1 3 10]`), and list is mutated, indexes will point to the items that were not selected, but just stay in the same place. Making /selected a hash! of items from the data set (forced to be unique in sameness) or a hash! of `item` space objects (required to be unique) seems more reasonable. Though on mutation it may require some cleanup. 

So far I see no strong case for *same* items to be allowed in a list with selection support, but thank you all for your thoughts. Helps me get a clearer picture.

hiiamboris: The data displayed from the list needs to be a copied view of the source data and your code should keep the indexes, so if the list in mutated, your code will reflect this.

Also, a list could display a record position in a column, which is inplicit in data stored in a sequence, so it is essential to support duplicated values because they are really not duplicate.

```

>> c/f

== make object! [

>> reduce c/f
*** Script Error: x has no value
*** Where: reduce
*** Near : reduce c/f
*** Stack:

What I am looking after is something like the second example, if there is sometihing like `to word! "x"` that doesn't need conversion from string (`unbind 'x` for example).

greggirwin (Gregg Irwin): Good question. Now I think that I probably need to rework my evaluation logic. I am using simple `get` just to test if the word is in `system/words` but if the word is bound elsewhere, it fails (fail for me means that it returns a value).

However, I probably should test just for `system/words` and maybe some other allowed contexts.

Actually, even allowing `system/words` is very generous, but useful for testing. I'm definitely going to limit where to look for word's value.

As Red's `parse` ignores empty string (not like Rebol)...
```red
>> parse "ab" ["" to end]
== true
```
Would not it be logical that `find/match "ab" ""` would return `"ab"` and not `none`?

## 23-May-2023

[19:52:18](#56oSbPyzuN6sEjqsJyWMhIxSDOcJu-WXWiU8DUHIUqM) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
It's a good question, but in `parse`, the rules are *patterns*, while in `find` they're strictly *values*. In `parse`, they are part of a larger pattern sequence, so need to make sense in that context. In `find` it's a one-off match.

`parse "ab" ["" to end]` == Is there nothing before "ab"? Yes, there is. I think Red is better than R2 here, because it treats `""` consistently at head or tail.

`find "ab" ""` == Is there an empty string as part of any string? Can go either way, but strings aren't nestable. So `""` isn't a value you can find. Same goes for `parse` of course.

So let's talk use cases and if searching for `""` should be an error instead. What's most useful?

[20:26:59](#51eXgJhLzaoeXWQF-XCN3Ma1VRlDba_Y4jERgtFXtsM) <hiiamboris (@hiiamboris:tchncs.de)>:
I should think that `none = find/match [] []` is just a consequence of `none = find [] []`. Which in turn is as you say isn't a value you can find. Though it could just return the `series` as is: `parse` does find it at every location with `to`/`thru` as one would expect.

[20:30:43](#PZ8yaDw4qB7G-w1ydL2z4UgGPI_N91VPYfBfCbmj0kg) <hiiamboris (@hiiamboris:tchncs.de)>:
I find what Oldes is proposing more consistent, but I presume the current behavior was introduced as deadlock defence in loops, to ensure `find/tail` always advances.

There are a lot of different ways to do it. There may even be simple SaaS offerings that would get you started. The basic idea is easy: generate a key using a seed. The seed is important, and may be the licencee's name, because you need to run the same code on the client to verify the key (or have it hit an API to do so). You can also use a very simple system if you're not worried about people hacking your license system.

Because you're not converting to a specific datatype. Is it possible that `to` could be smarter and load the actual word by contents, to create a specific type? e.g. `to datatype! 'set-word!`. I think you mean that should return `set-word!` as a datatype, but are there any other `to` conversions that work that way?

As I noted above (my opinion of course), it doesn't make sense. `get` is the correct semantic match for this behavior. The only reason it's less convenient is if you want to run the same code under Rebol and Red. But the answer there is that `get` works under Rebol too. :^)

Is it technically hard to add? No. But why do we need it, if we already have a better way?

If R3 adds that behavior, what about typesets? It breaks the hard-coded list part of the equation, because you *can* make typesets at the user level. 

And how are these going to be implemented internally? Yup, using `get`.

It doesn't matter if it was there to begin with. Carl did it in R2 and carried it over. My view is that it shouldn't do either. But if it does one, it should do both, given something like Bolek's example.

`to` is a conversion/casting action. By it's nature the types have to be compatible in some sense, right? And while we can make new values that won't lex, if we try, some things don't make sense at all.

So let's say `to datatype! 'integer!` works, as rebolek (Boleslav B≈ôezovsk√Ω) noted this works for `word!` and `issue!` Should `to datatype! "integer!"` also work? If not, why not? You *can* do `to typeset! [integer! float! percent!]` in Red today, and ` to block! number!`. It's a two way street. You can also do `to word! integer!` and `to string! integer!`. So we *could* argue that it should also go both ways. But it also tells me that this was a conscious design choice made by dockimbel and, right now, I think it was a good one.

Choices like this relate to the big picture of how strict or automatic a language is, and that's a balancing act. If we're too strict, you spend time doing things just to make the compiler happy, which don't matter to you. Too automatic, and conversions happen unintentionally, errors are hidden, everything is a string, and finding the root problem becomes much harder (especially when dynamic content is involved). It also depends on the context, and why dialects can be so important.

An interesting aspect to their hot code loading, compared to Red, is that there may be a lot of things that are data, and which an environment would see as changed automatically. But how to determine what needs to be reloaded is trickier. If running interpreted, as Red would, you could track what function/section/etc. is being edited. Should make for fun experiments. toomasv did a lot of this for DiaGrammar.

That's a long discussion, I can copy/paste later my rant here about `tuple!` design failure. In a nutshell, it is better to have the type-checker do the work than the end user, having to test for which point size is a given value in many places in the code.

> Will not be pair to points math a bit confusing?

How so?

> do you expect pair becoming obsolete over time?

For 2D graphics in general, probably yes. Pair is still used internally to represent some integer ranges (lexer and interpreter callbacks rely on it). Moreover, as a datatype, it is still a very valuable literal form for dialects (not necessarily GUI-oriented ones). For example, if we add a Turtle Graphics dialect for learning purposes, we might use pairs instead of points, as we can limit graphics coordinates and sizes to integers for sake of simplicity and shortness.

For those thinking that having less datatypes is better, take the Lua example with tables. Imagine that `block!`, `vector!`, `object!`, `map!` and all their existing and future derivative types where just `table!`. Now imagine reading any third-party code where all function arguments that are value-oriented data-structures are marked as just `table!`... Do you think that makes the code more readable and maintenable?

In a nutshell, it is better to have the type-checker do the work than the end user, having to test for which point size is a given value in many places in the code.

It's an arguable example. Lua has completely different way of working with series. `head` or `skip`  will make for lua table as much sense as for our current `map!` implementation. Like many other languages, they don't iterate directly over series, they just increase the index and look it up. Could our blocks internally work the same way? Less efficiently but sure, why not. Underlying array is purely an optimization artifact. 

Vectors too are merely a way to pack values more efficiently together; ensuring unity of types can be done in other ways. If not for memory locality of arrays and expensiveness of hash lookups, Redbol memory model could have been completely different, not requiring vectors at all, or at least making them a kind of block with automatic typecheck.

Object vs map differ in the ability to bind to it and restriction on key type. Binding doesn't even exist in lua, so they've no reason to restrict key type. Then they have no reason for the distinction. So object/map difference is a consequence of Redbol contextual relativity.

To summarize, if not for resource scarcity arguments, there would be no reason for us to have `block!` and `vector!`, just `object!` and `map!`, as adding those would trade simplicity for nothing.

it also uses `(<x>, <y>)` syntax, which is weird because it introduces commas into the language syntax, and it overloads the syntax for parens. I feel like the previous pair syntax could've been used, or even have merged `point!` and `pair!` together (I know it has been discussed at some point)

I have felt the same about paren syntax and commas. I have supposed commas are needed for recognizing Point2x.

Alan, thanks for you feedback! Those  seems like subjective feelings, some due to long familiarity with pair syntax, some look to me like reluctance to changes. We can't use subjective preferences as a guide to design, we need objective reasons.

For "overload paren syntax", I tend to agree on first look. Though, after spending a while reading VID code with literal points in there, the familiarity is good enough that I don't mind it anymore. One aspect that still  diverts a bit my attention is VID code wrapped with a `compose` call. The more literal points in there, the more I  have to visually scan to find the evaluated expressions. Though, that's really very little overhead as the points literal tends to stand out easily compared to regular code in parens.

Certainly not. Points literals are couples/triples of scalar numbers, not containers for arbitrary values like blocks and parens. Parens are series, points are not.

They are more rebolish as they don't contain commas and also the initial symbol clears the idea about the content, something that with the current implementation you can do only onlooking after the fist number.

dockimbel: As for replacing commas for points, e.g. having `@(3.10 1.22)` is not probably more readable than having `(3.10, 1.22)`, but frees comma for an eventual separator purpose.

In the past, I have e.g. proposed a separator using a pipe char for oneliners. But it was not found as being much useful, apart from cases like:

`n: 0 | foreach item records [n: n + 1 | print [n item]]`

Then I have thought about another case - a block record separator, which whould get "ignored" by lexer:

`[ 1 2 3 | 3 2 5 | 1 9 7]`

Could comma be used instead of pipe char?

`n: 0 , foreach item records [n: n + 1 , print [n item]]`
`[ 1 2 3 , 3 2 5 , 1 9 7]`

Not sure. What do you think guys? Not that it should become a hot topic, just curious :-)

In written language punctuation plays an important role. Commas are a pause, or even an escape to a sub-topic, in related thoughts. In times long ago, ASCII chars 28-31 had meaning. In the 90s there was a very cool database called Cascade/DB which stored data as sparse, delimited strings, sort of like Pick/OS, but not the same. Markers had structural meaning, giving a few levels of control, which is often all we need.

No. Maps behave differently, as keys are created on demand. And blocks aren't updated by value, not as key-value structures. Maps *could* support this, but it isn't there today and needs design thought.

Anyway, Even if the R3 version can parse more MD docs than the Red version, it also has problems.

The biggest one being that it's one-pass version, while MD parsing should be two-pass, meaning that MD should first be converted to AST and then to HTML. R3 version doesn't do that and therefore it can never support some features of MD.

Red version is much better in this regard, it first converts MD to Lest (which is kind of AST) and then Lest source is converted to HTML.

So when I was saying that R3 version should be basis for further development, I was wrong. The proper way would be to unite the sources, make a version that uses two-pass algorithm from Red version and parse-rule management from Rebol version.

So that's the short answer to your question.

First of all: you should avoid the `foreach [k v] ...` approach like hell. It takes more than 5 minutes against few milliseconds of the fastest ones.

 * I have created a little test to discover which method is better to access a structure of containers as:
`[key value]` or
`[[key value][key value]...]` or
`[object! [key value]...]` or
`#(key val key val)` or
`[#(key val key val)]` or

When using block it was tested either hashed and simple, either externally or internally.

The tested access methods where:

```
select/skip
path/:column 
path/1/:column
foreach [k v] ..
path/:index
path/:index1/:index2
```

Each one where applicable:

Here is the [test](https://gist.github.com/GiuseppeChillemi/78e5bb5e89e23885149add5fb3a1dea4)

And the results:
(Those with no method are using `SELECT`)

It is clear that hashed blocks and paths have some kind of cache. It is also clear that when looping instructions are used, times skyrockets. Also,a simple test of the existence of a key for an object, (the ...-4ob tests) adds more than 20 minutes to a 35 minutes test.
I think when we will have the optimization backend, all these number will change.

Changing it just means a lateral design move, not necessarily better. The index vs offset area can be tricky, but nobody has found a better overall design that I know of.

It might be resource / memory consuming, especially in cases, where you loop over the buffer, no? 

My opinion is, that where possible, such stuff requiring the copy of data, should be avoided. When Cyphre did a Grid element for me, it used original SQL query data response and all column / row stuff was virtual with zero shufffling with the data and then again sending it back.

I also do remember there was an idea for the streamed parser. Not sure how it was supposed to work, but I can imagine parse being abstracted, telling it to use a reverse direction.

This is not a problem with AT. But if you ask:

Copy/part s at s 4

You think It will stop copying at position 4 included (at character D),  instead It Is EXCLUDED, so It Will stop coping at position 3
Instead of you use 4 as end position, It will stop copying at position 4.
The two modes works differently. One stoppes BEFORE the expressed position (if you use a string), another at expressed one (if you use and integer).

Well, as for `copy/part at s 4`, at first sight, the result is unexpected even for me. I thought, it takes index (integer!), but truth is `type? at s 4 == string!`, so it takes string as a parameter. But then it takes carriage position, which is before the fourth character, and hence it returns just first 3 chars?

It could remain as It Is but we should simply clear that one refers to the index, the other to the tail position. Otherwise you tend to learn the first take you learn.

There are a lot of particulars to remember that sometime you forget and visible words takes precedence. Also, I don't know the precise concept of offset. For me you count from the next element  but it iseems you should count from the current one.

If you add a "tail" slot that lies beyond the last element (so never visible) to the series model, then there's no need for "in-between" positions anymore. See the graphics in Rebol docs:

Is that tail slot a thing implementation-wise (i.e. does each seres carry one such invisible tail element)? Even then I'd consider it a mere implementation detail. The two approaches "invisible tail element" vs. my "caret or bar cursor as index"-explanation seem to be fairly equivalent.

The cognitive load is excessive with too many similar elements, so you start exchanging one thing with another. This is the reason of the coding errors. Have you ever swapped letters while writing? Have you ever swapped objects to take so you must bring with you the keys but you take a bottle of water? This is a know phenomenon when an action is applicable to multiple targets. So, when you think about using an index, you write offset, or you change the index calculation rule with the offset one.

Copy has different working when you use either integer or series as `/part`. If you use series, when its index is higher (at positive offset)  than original series, you have one kind of results, when it is neggative, you have another. Also, you must consider that if they have both the same index, the result is empty.

You are missing the point. You have the same 2 charater but the center is shifted:

```
>> copy/part at s: "abcde" 3 at s (3 + 2)
== "cd"
>> copy/part at s: "abcde" 3 at s (3 - 2)
== "ab"
```
One includes the starting origin, another does not include it.
In on positive side, index element 5 in included, on negative side index element 1, which is at the same numerical calculation (-2) is excluded. When you create code which goes backward instead of forward because you can't use the native `COPY` you must consider all the differencies.

In the missing parts stands the devil.
You should be able to reverse the direction. So you take and the go backward removing all LF
You should consider the first line doing this
You should consider a last line without LF
LF can be changed with a KEY to search of any size.

IIRC, `join` is considered as a name for a more useful function than just `join val1 val2`. I'm not sure why there's not `reform`, I guess its usage is so low nobody cared enough to implement it.

So, when you access them again, you will find the previous value until you COPY the empty container with COPY "" or COPY []. write a: "" instead of a: copy "" and when you return to that point of the code you will find what you have written in the string afterward rather than setting It to an empty value.

Consider that this is the entire source for `finger` and `whois`:

```
make Root-Protocol [
	open-check:  [[any [port/user ""]] none]
	net-utils/net-install Finger self 79
	net-utils/net-install Whois make self [] 43
]
```
`NNTP` is bigger, but think instead about writing user facing clients for protocols, which could then also use programmatic navigation.

A key aspect of all the datatypes, protocols, and more is that they add semantic meaning for the humans reading the code.

It's not just that, it's a gray area. In R2, Carl never answered this completely either. 

We can agree that paths are a collection of values, today starting with a word. And we can probably agree that a path's non-first elements are refinements in the sense of navigation and specification. 

The issue hits a bump because refinements have limited syntax, and paths treat their segments as values, ignoring the `/` _delimiter_.

Right. It may be confusing to have different behavior, but that's something we just have to explain clearly. Paths are blocks, and can contain any value in a segment. But the lexical form doesn't work well for all values there. e.g.

NR> one could argue that there should not be any consistency constraint in path vs refinement literal forms, though that does not look like a strong position to hold to me.

I think the argument there is that paths are a block type, and may contain any value in a segment. That runs up against your issue with parens and what makes sense in a literal form with a sticky delimiter. There is no perfect answer here.

Telegram requires your phone number. Matrix doesn't. Discord is even worse, the first thing it asked me was my birthday. Really, no.

 * I am against switching to _anything_ currently existing. Switching to anything different means losing history _and_ users _and_ also privacy.
Telegram requires your phone number. Matrix doesn't. Discord is even worse, the first thing it asked me was my birthday. Really, no.

We all want better interface, so let's make a better interface based on existing infrastructure. There's no need to switch infrastructure or to invent our own from scratch.

I have taken hiiamboris' suggestion and started using nheko. The 'read messages' detection and jumpy scrolling was making me crazy in Element, but I haven't noticed any problems with those in nheko so far. The message thread interface takes a little getting used to, but I didn't much like Element's interface anyway. I don't plan on going back

There are multiple ways to achieve what you want. To get the result, you need to `do` or `reduce` it. One way is to remove inner brackets and just `reduce` the block:
```
>> vec:  [not make logic! mod 9 3 not make logic! mod 9 5 not make logic! mod 9 7]
== [not make logic! mod 9 3 not make logic! mod 9 5 not make logic! mod 9 7]

This inspired me to improve my own solution :-) Btw perhaps `not make logic!` could be more clear by just comparing to zero? There's even a `zero?` function for that purpose.

A simple one could be:

r: range! 1 10
; == [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]
```

No need a `in-range?` function, you can use `find`:

```
not none? find r 5
; == true
```

Of course it is not a datatype, it's just a block.

Hmmm ... now the one thing that mitigates against that solution is that 1.5 is in the middle of `range! 0 2` but won't be found because we've assumed a range of numbers.

So how would I write two functions: `range!` to define the upper and lower bounds and `range?` to test against that range? At worst just `range?` with three parameters, the lower bound, the upper bound and the value to test

Do you want to find a value in a range of values, or do you want to  test that a value is between two other values?

With three values you can simply check if the value is between the other two:
```
between?: func [a b c] [all [a >= min b c a <= max b c]]
```

with the range function above, assuming the values are always sorted:

```
range?: func [a r] [all [a >= first r a <= last r]]
```

But. better to move to welcome or help room.

What do you think of this argument type mixing case:
```
>> f: func [a :b] [?? a ?? b]
>> f 'z x
a: z
b: x
>> f 'z +
*** Script Error: + does not allow word! for its value1 argument
*** Where: +
*** Near : f 'z +
*** Stack: f 
```
Effectively, for argument N to work as lit-arg or get-arg, we must require argument N-1 to also be either lit-arg or get-arg. Else it can't function as intended.

an experiment:
`https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22herg%C3%A9+%26+tintin%22&ia=web` (which duck sees as `"herg√© & tintin"`)
if I remove the `26` from the browser url, leaving only `%` thus forcing the browser to enhex it:
`https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22herg%C3%A9+%+tintin%22&ia=web`
then the URL gets replaced with
`https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%2522herg%25C3%25A9%2B%25%2Btintin%2522&ia=web`
which loads fine with `"herg√© % tintin"` query until I refresh the page, when the URL remains the same, but the duck query becomes `%22herg%C3%A9+%+tintin%22`

- I wonder, why fields as `enabled?, visible?, selected`are the direct face fields, while `prev, next`live inside the `option` block. Maybe we don't want to polute the face size?

- ``prev, next` were a bit surprising for me. They need looped traversal, as can be seen in an example. I have expected list of focusable elements being a field in the parent window structure.

It was another case of aggressive caching by the front web server. I've made some minor changes to force a reload. Hopefully, it should not happen anymore.

Because of the small size, and relatively infrequent updates, my model was usually to have a timestamped-name version, which came down and terminated the old version with the base name, then copying itself to the base name.

What may help you is define iterator functions (like `next`) outside of it, then assign to the iterator:

iter: make iterator! [

There's this older post wrt. Rebol as well [Is Rebol a Pure Functional Language?](http://www.rebol.com/article/0206.html). One experiment on a Rebol 3 branch was to lock strings/series that were created from literal notation so that if you wanted the 'leaky' behaviour, you had to be more deliberate about it. Just saying `append #{} 1` would throw an error. Personally I didn't find it to be too prohibitive and made me more aware of where I was using the feature inadvertently.

For me it's just different, not definitively better. Copying series is a thing you learn very quickly, and is easy to reason about. As Gab once said, if you don't want shared series, just always use `copy` when you define them. It's not that hard.

That would be a HUGE change, but also easy to do at the mezz level, if less efficient. For a reasonable number of items it won't hurt much. But then you need to provide access for all the standard funcs/natives, which is the painful part. This is just higher level functionality than generic types support.

Both mutability and immutability have their merits. I'm fine with using `copy`, but IMO two things must be done:

Give a Type to a data container, so I don't have to store It inside the cantainer, forcing me to consider Its pesence in every function.

But then you need to provide access for all the standard funcs/natives, which is the painful part. This is just higher level functionality than generic types support. In order to do so, their cells would have to expand to support general metadata.

It should be only an additional word in the VALUE structure. No function should take care of it apart creation and duplication of the VALUE.

I don't generally make the slippery-slope argument, but I will here, a little. Adding one piece of metadata may solve your current problem, but as soon as someone needs another piece, or more pieces, we still need a general solution.

`protect`, at least in R2, doesn't protect the value, but the word. This is something else. If done at eval time, then `do` also has to have some kind of copy-on-write mechanism. I'll have to think more, but I don't think `do` and `protect` are the right mechanisms here. If we want immutable values, that can just be a flag in the header.

Have custom data structure and custom AT , NEXT, SELECT, PICK... able to handle them. I want the data container to be a pure Red One that when empty has no TYPE in It, so I don't have an alien word, expecially on objects. So the type of data structure tied to the container and not in the content, which could be handled regardless of the type Word.

That's not the mix of features I imagined, so thanks to @gtewalt for asking the important, clarifying question. 

Given your goals, you may want to create a system to support it. i.e. define a general object that has `type`, `content`, and refs to custom handlers for `at, next, etc.`. Then you have your own global wrappers for those, that know how to deal with your objects. The object then knows if it can use the standard natives, because it has no type. 

Even if we want to add something like this to Red, and I don't know if we would, experiments like this will be important.

It doesn't look like "mapping" or "coerce" come up in the red/system language specification. Can you explain a little further on this approach? Does it work like a union where the union's size takes on the largest type and when using it as a different type it maps/demaps correctly? Thanks!

There is no such feature at the moment, probably because it's not critical, or needed for Red development. But R/S gives you enough to work around, e.g.:

	x-b2 [byte!]
	x-b3 [byte!]
	x-b4 [byte!]
	y    [integer!]
]
my-struct-2: alias struct! [
	x    [integer!]
	y    [integer!]
]

value: declare my-struct-1
value/x-b1: as byte! 1
value/x-b2: as byte! 2
value/x-b3: as byte! 3
value/x-b4: as byte! 4
value/y:    5

value2: as my-struct-2 value      ;) same 'value' seen using 'my-struct2' view

Well, in the worst case `pint: as int-ptr! (as byte-ptr! base-address) + byte-offset` or anything in place of `int-ptr!` gives you byte-precise access to any memory location. And you should be able to optimize it for readability if you leverage macros.

Working on creating a model to have custom datatypes, I have often needed a way to pass the datatype object elements as arguments. So I had some functions with very similar or equal interfaces, and their interface equal to the target data. In this scenario, I see a candidate use for this feature.

About this topic I have differet hypotesys but nothing clear. You are right that verification must be on the object because it is on SET time but this also adds overhead because it would happen on each set. If you have a group of function, you may want it only on the first (gate on) one. So if you peprform a strict loop you may operate without security and so very fast.

I suppose when a function is invocated, a new context frame is created, then the body of function words use It. Call again the function and a new context frame is created. Well, think about APPLY calling the function providing an object which is used as context frame, so you don't have to rebind the body; create a new context frame; set its words; typecheck the values. (Leaving this as option with an APPLY refinement).

I found that view doesn't work when interpreted. When I compiled it I found that some of my code that does work while interpreted doesn't work when compiled:
* have to use #include instead of do
* func definitions compiled only allow a single string before the params while interpreted allows any number

what are other general things to look for while trying to get my code to work when compiled? it's telling me a variable has no value. I'm guessing it has something to do with a difference in behavior of /local

1. yes, use `#include` in place `do` because you don't want to carry the source files together with the binary
2. compile with `-e`, which is the equivalent of wrapping all your code into a `do [...]` clause

You're probably using a headless linux CLI console? In that case you either need to use GUI console, or compile CLI console with `View` module support.

If `view has no value`, then you have not included the `view` module using `needs: [view]` in the header of the main file like it is done [here](https://github.com/red/red/blob/5dc266ec8f671b09bcf28838cded95023f39116f/environment/console/GUI/gui-console.red#L8) (note that if you are including just one module, you may use just `needs: view` like [here](https://github.com/red/red/blob/5dc266ec8f671b09bcf28838cded95023f39116f/environment/console/GUI/old/gui-console.red#L7)

After some more specific testing I found that I'm getting the same functional behavior from -c and -r. I'll post a new thread for the issue I'm seeing with compiling.

[18:34:26](#-rhoK0HpnZUnyOY2PVHA4_uyFqBgOEMa2Ahd8rj1IRk) <SkySpiral7>:
I'm seeing a confusing issue with compilation. I've narrowed it down to this minimum reproducible example:
```red
Red []

print ""
print ""

deltaIterator: context [
   someConstant: 64
   deltaStream: 64

   parseNext: does [
      prin "top deltaStream = "
      print deltaStream
      switch deltaStream reduce [
         someConstant [
            prin "switch deltaStream = "
            print deltaStream
         ]
      ]
   ]
]

applyDelta: does [
   deltaItr: make deltaIterator []
   print "before parseNext"
   deltaItr/parseNext
   print "after parseNext"
]
applyDelta
```
When compiling that code with `redc -c` or `redc -r` then running it, it will fail with "Script Error: deltaStream has no value". However compiling with `redc -e` or not compiling with just `red` doesn't get this error. Additionally `redc -c` will work with any of these (illogical) changes:
* If deltaStream is moved outside of deltaIterator.
* If deltaStream is moved inside of deltaIterator/parseNext.
* If deltaIterator/parseNext switch statment doesn't reduce.
* If the lines for applyDelta are put directly in the red script (instead of in a function).

I'd open a github issue for this but thought I'd ask here first because like... What the heck is even going on?

            )
            | skip
         ]
      ]
   ]
]
```
. testBody has the correct lines but I'd like to modify the contents of it further. How can I do that? I can't just put `change` after the `copy testBody` line since `change` operates on the parsed input (not a given word). I can't use `into` since this is a big string (not a block). Yes I know I could `load` the text first but I figured keeping it as text would be easier for what I'm doing.

Also let me know if I should be putting this in another room instead.

As with libraries and modules, we should be able to work at low levels, then step up a layer and make sub-assemblies, design interfaces to those, test them, include them in a project, along with custom data interface needs and viewers; organize those elements for high level understanding and business use cases, allowing each person or team to work with their own custom environment but *also* see *how* people are using them.

Thanks for sharing. When you get to accessing function bodies, around 00:24, you want to use a `get-word!` to get, but not evaluate, a function. e.g. `:f` vs `f`. Then you can use reflectors like `spec-of/body-of` as well. And where you had `f/y`, Red expected that the function supported a *refinement* called `y`.

The wheels aren't wasted. Building them is fun, good practice, and easy (look how many are one-liners in your code). One reason things aren't there yet is that building a general wheel, tire, lug system isn't quite so easy. The code isn't hard, but the design and big picture thinking are.

another trouble is that some features can't even be implemented with the code I have, as what I've got is one-pass parser but some Markdown features require two-pass parser (first translate MD source to AST, then AST to HTML or whatever).

So I started rewrite of the parser to use Lest as intermediate AST format (for which Lest is perfect), however, due to lack of time, this is not finished yet.

mbk (Maarten Koopmans): HTML codec is not in that repo, but you can find it in [CASTR repo](https://gitlab.com/rebolek/castr/-/blob/master/html-codec.red?ref_type=heads).
Unlike XML codec, which is very strict, HTML codec tries to be very forgivable, given the number of malformed HTML available. It doesn't mean it will parse everything, but it tries to :)

Also, consider that SQL makes order irrelevant, by design. It can be nice, for many reasons, including human interaction, when things are stable. But it also means that the structure and code working against it is more fragile. If you have two records, differing only by key order, are they equal or not? It depends, right? But if they are treated as key-value structures, accessed only by key, the keys matter but not their order.

Again on this topic.. If the order is not guarranted, how we have coherency in these two subsequent calls? Only `body-of` can do this:

It's true that `values-of` is lossy, but there are also cases where it could be useful. We could also press to always have order guaranteed for maps, though this may mean tradeoffs in performance or complexity. The point of maps, is to use the keys. If you want a generic data structure that guarantees order, use blocks. If you want order and path access for keys, use objects. They are not 100% interchangeable. Some languages *do* have a structure that serves all these purposes, and it comes with tradeoffs.

I agree that maps are often small, unlike blocks, and that this could be useful. It just won't be free, and you need to get Boris, Bolek, and maybe some others on board.

The problem with objects is that they do not support some words allowed in some database engines. You can't have a 2DO field name, you must rely in strings for it, so only map remains and there you loose column order.

It's not that it would be difficult to implement, but is it a *good design element*? As with maps as path keys, what are the use cases where you need a literal block rather than using a `get-word!` in the path, and have that reference a block?

It would be preferable if all argumentes are GET instead of evaluated, so function values don't head anything. An additional refinement would help.

Also, it would be highly preferable if you can pass a context too (either as an object or function one), so APPLY could perform VALUES-OF in full autonomy.

We have the basic data types for symbolic manipulation, the brand new apply, file manipulation.... View, Draw and RTD are amazing. 

Once we have network IO in Red we can write more serious programs. I think the cost of not having IO is much higher than potential rewrites down the line.

There are 2 options: 
1) An error
2) `NONE` for arguments and FALSE for refinements (Default values when we will have them)
The second one gives protection too, because, rarely ARGS accepts `NONE`, so passing them would trigger an error if there is type check on the ARG.

I've done a lot of work with IO branch. There's very capable HTTP/S client and server and qtxie fixed *a lot* of bugs I found while writing them. I would say that IO branch can be merged to master in it's current version and Red would benefit from it.
OTOH, current API is based on R3 and Nenad wants to change it. I'm not against the change, I don't think that R3 IO API is very user-friendly, but I think that's a minor problem. That API is a low-level one and a better one can be built on top of it.
I even think that not merging IO to master is holding the new API design back, as users could and would create abstractions based on the R3 model that could be later incorporated into higher-level API.

That said, I invite everyone to use IO branch, as it's mature and well-tested and it's a shame it's not part of master branch yet. A lot of great work has be done on the branch by qtxie and people could really benefit from it.
And if raw TCP isn't enough for you, I worked really hard not on HTTP only, but on other protocols also. Everything is available on my GitHub/GitLab, if you're interested in some particular protocol, feel free to ask, I can point you to it or at least givesome info.

I have the personal opinion that paths should be able to have parens regardless, as an example for stuff like `my-map/(key): foo` looks significantly more straightforward than `my-map/:key: foo` or `put my-map key`, and will likely lead to an easier learning curve for beginners who may expect this kind of behavior because they associate paths with stuff like subscripts and field access in other languages

Use a block for args in that case. Variable arity funcs aren't possible in Red. In your example it would have already created the stack frame and called the func before it knew how many args your func was going to grab.

That said, you could roll your own stack-based call system, much like Forth, but that model can be much harder to reason about and maintain, especially as code bases become larger. One reason is that you can't know at the call site how many args will be consumed (already tricky with free ranging evaluation). Another is that inside the function you don't know if the right number of args are on the "stack". Mistakes on either side can be very hard to find and fix.

But making your own `push/pop` funcs with a block stack is really easy, if you want to explore this idea.

I have explored this idea and I have a working model but this goes further:

Once a stack frame has been created and function body start being executed, I would like to access the block-pointer which should be positioned at call-site + function_args. Then, each `get-next nargs` from inside the function, the nargs are returned and block ponter moves to nargs + 1. When the function returns, the interpreter restarts at that position.

There are a number of examples along the lines of what you're doing. Here's one: https://github.com/red/community/blob/master/demos/math-lab.red

When I see people building code strings, I often suggest to build code blocks instead. `Load` the data from the UI elements and do all you can with Red data, rather than building strings and `do`ing those. You still `do` it, but is a much better approach IMO.

[17:25:47](#Ma5Ch_hHbtGi6-HMaiKy6RJkt6Da5wrFvQtUbYziMVI) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:

Here's a start on one way, but you may want to make your tasks objects. I did this, then saw that your `gen` bit is probably expected to use `fn` and `inputs` from its context. I like the task specs as blocks so, your mission should you choose to accept it, is to keep that part, but make the tasks objects, then fill in the missing call and output bits from below.

Howdy guys, I'm poking around with Rebol right now and have a couple of newbie questions:

Is there a better way to "collect" a series of values?
```
sum: 0
foreach  i [1 2 3] [sum: sum + i]

product: 0
foreach i [1 2 3] [product: product * i]
```
and et cetera. What I want basically is something like `foldr + [1 2 3]`. Of course I can build simple function for this, but I wonder if it can be done in some tricky Rebol-way with basic language constructs?

I can't wrap my head around this one here:
```
print repeat i 10 [if i = 5 [break/return i]] ; >> 5
print for i 1 10 1 [if i = 5 [break/return i]] ; >> none
```
why `for` returns `none`, what I'm missing?

How can I break from multiple nested loops at one time?
```
print for i 1 5 1 [
    for j 1 5 1 [
        if "whatever" [break from j-loop AND from i-loop, while returning something to print]
    ]
]
```

I've found Rebol documentation to be really scarse  :( 
Any suggestions, except for Nick's guides and rebol dot com books/resources?

Finally, some quote by memory:
> Truly, a holy programming language is a homoiconic one.
> Whenever God speaks to a man, he uses Lisp with inline Assembly.

And that's what Red is, huh? ;) I'm so excited to find such a gem.

Thanks in advance!

If that's true, great. Show me the formula. :^)

But since so many languages fail or remain very niche, and from all the ways we've looked at the problem and how the world of software tooling works today, nobody else knows the formula either.

Don't follow this Path, as you loose the sync once you have It. I remember having tried repositioning to line 1 and the again to the current line or something similar to have alignment but It has not worked after prolonged use.

Hello, I am new to Red and I explore at the moment the error-handling. Do I see it correctly, that Errors are simply values, like in Go? But the error-handling is done with an exception based apporach?

>> do [print 10 wait 1 print 9 wait 1 print 8 wait 1 print 7 wait 1 print 6]
I expected that this prints 10, waits 1 seconds, then prints 9 and so forth. But in red-view it waits 4 Seconds, and then to all the printing. Why?

You can also do `?? split` to see the source (or `source split` for more clarity). In this case you can see that `parse` is used, so here it depends on how that treats values when parsing.

Hi. There is this question in Quora comparing list comprehensions in languages other than Python

The example was to square even integer numbers in range 1..10

I proposed this in Red

`foreach x collect [repeat n 10 [if zero? n % 2 [keep n]]] [print x * x]`

Is there any shorter form (provided there's no native range in Red) ?

List comprehensions are language syntax, used in place of `map, etc.` in functional langs or FLWOR in dataset oriented cases. Just different ways to express the same logic. I think I had some FLWOR notes in the XML work done for Red, but only a placeholder in the HOF work. Red can achieve its own approach with a dialect, but we haven't nailed down `range` or basic HOFs to see how things might unify and be wrapped.

In case there would be a problem in the R/S compiler which would create a loopback chain, I am sure there would be a temporary workaround util the malignant loop is broken.

The Road To 1.0

You cannot have missed that in the last months (and even last years), our overall progress has slowed down drastically. One of the main reasons is that we have spread our limited resources chasing different objectives while making little progress on the core language. That is not satisfying at all and would bring us most likely to a dead-end as we exhaust our funding. We have spent the last weeks discussing about how to change that. This is our updated action plan.

From now on, our only focus will be to finish the core language and bring it to the much-awaited version 1.0. We need to reach that point in order to kickstart a broader adoption and provide us and our users a stable and robust foundation upon which we can build commercial products and services necessary for sustainability.

Given the complexities involved in completing the language and bringing an implementation that can run on modern 64-bit platforms, we have devised a two-stage plan.


Upgrade the current 32-bit Red implementation
Ì†ΩÌ±â Concurrency

We need a proper model for concurrent execution in order to leverage multicore architectures. We will define one and make a prototype implementation in the 32-bit version.

A key driver for feature priority is real world use cases. Concurrency takes many forms, so it's not just an isolated feature. We want to make a general design, of course, but Erlang process style concurrency is very different from Go channels and go-routines or Linda's Tuplespaces. It also ties to I/O and how async comes to be for concurrent uses, or lets you avoid them altogether (like Node.js).

> <@vazub:matrix.org> I would honestly suggest also taking a look at Pony‚Äôs approach to concurrency, when considering design choices.

How does Pony's differ from actor models (e.g. Erlang)? 

In a language, it's tempting to make it by adding ingredients you've seen used elsewhere. What you end up with, then, is stew. :^) 

You have to look at things in context, and Red is quite a different context. We think in terms of high level datatypes that have rich lexical forms, and are often in blocks that form a "message" (or data record) of some kind. Red is also highly dynamic, so the goals of compile time checking aren't a good fit (where they are in Pony). 

Now, think about concurrency in the small (CitS) versus in the large (CitL). Do we win more if we think of in-process concurrency or inter-process (system) concurrency? Do we need super performance like an LMAX Disrutpor gives, or do we gain more from a universal model and coordination like Linda pioneered? Does that still give us enough performance, and is the in vs inter difference hidden inside the concurrency engine so you never even know or care (same as how QNX processes use messaging)?

Now, being dynamic vs compiled, is probably quite a valid concern. However, the point of Red (at least on paper) is to be able to compile down to native binary, so you guys probably already have some aces down your sleeves in this regard.

The whole raison d'etre of Pony is to provide a concurrency solution that is fully safe (math proved, check out papers). As much as I adore Go (I was a fan right when it just started, long before it became popular), it is not completely guarded against data races, so this here is quite an enticing deal for me to play with Pony. And compared to Rust, it is much more pleasant on the readability and actual comfort of use. 

[16:18:42](#p9l2SwoFiL8IwevrBqWRBPi-mtmkku7itq1iXay8_W4) <bazub>:
Now, being a fan of Rebol/Red as well, it would be quite interesting to see if any of them can adopt something like Pony has, if possible, of course. That could be really a killer feature. Although, to be honest, Go's CSP approach could work just fine as well, if nothing else, but it would probably suffer from the same deficiencies, unless you come up with ways to improve on it.

We mustn't confused compiled with static. R/S is static, and there are many things in Red that simply can't be AoT compiled because not enough information exists in the source. That's where a JiT would have to step in.

Not sure for Linux / OS-X, but Windows does not have any suitable table / grid style anyway. So how to aproach that? Could we create some acceptable / similar to platform universal look for grid?

In this case the simple method still wins. However, you can gain speed by not using `rejoin`, which creates a temporary string, and also by preallocating the initial string to a large size.

Second answer first. Yes, it overwrites it.

It is the runtime for Red, externalized rather than being compiled into the EXE. This allows your exe to be much smaller. A great use case is if you have many apps that use the same runtime version. Rather than each being ~1.5M, they might be only 100K.

Now, if you want info on the embeddable version of the runtime, you can find its release notes here: https://www.red-lang.org/2017/03/062-libred-and-macros.html

As Runtime you mean all the part of Red like VID, Parse, Reactivity and??? 
What I do not understand is how a compiled Red script or an interpreted uses LibRedRT. Does a call to a Red build in function like `print` or `if` call the corresponding in LibRedRT?

You could have two compatible versions of the runtime, where the import declarations match.

mikeyaunish: That looks really great! I wish there had been something like that when I coded my first Red GUI.

One question - that might be stepping beyond your supported usage cases:

I like to use ON-CREATE to dynamically collect all the faces I am interesting in. That lets me later modify (or validate) all faces of a given type without having to give them all names. See simple example below.

Could something like that be easily accommodated in your model of Red GUIs?

```
facets: make object! [labels: make map! [] fields: make map! []]
view [text "Hello!" on-create [put facets/labels "greeting-1" face]]
```

By networking you mean IO, presumably? Because I see no branch titled "networking". Also, I see no branch activity on 64 bits...

Good question!
I hope my response (not really an answer) will help inspire you to solve the general problem, not just to address my issues:)
VID faces exist in a strict hierarchical framework - the LAYOUT, or the presentation layer if we are going all ISO model. But they have a different ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù at the application level. Applications (generally) benefit from having the faces in a logical (for the app) structure.
My methods attempts to do that by assigning a logical place for each face when they are created. The LAYOUT is now (to some extent) decoupled from the application logic.
So, a general solution may not be PUTing in a MAP. But there will, perhaps, be some way of assigning a logical/app meaning to each face.

Let me ask *why* you need an answer to this. I can answer, certainly, and that answer is Yes, with restrictions. The best thing to do is play with Red and see if you like it, then evaluate how mature it is and what specific features you need.

> VID faces exist in a strict hierarchical framework - the LAYOUT, or the presentation layer if we are going all ISO model. But they have a different ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù at the application level. Applications (generally) benefit from having the faces in a logical (for the app) structure.
> My methods attempts to do that by assigning a logical place for each face when they are created. The LAYOUT is now (to some extent) decoupled from the application logic.

dsunanda: In your experience how many different filters/tags are you needing per face? In your example program you just had the two. Type and Name, how many others would you be looking at?

Does it usually take this much work to try and get Red to work on FreeBSD? 

I got it going on a 32 bit jail instance of FreeBSD, but trying to get it to work on normal 64bit FreeBSD seems like I may be doing this the wrong way. 

Regardless I got it to work by moving 32 bit shared objects needed to run the compiled red programs over from my 32 bit jail instance to my 64 bit host. 

Or is this just the way until Red becomes 64bit language ?

> VID faces exist in a strict hierarchical framework - the LAYOUT, or the presentation layer if we are going all ISO model. But they have a different ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù at the application level. Applications (generally) benefit from having the faces in a logical (for the app) structure.
> My methods attempts to do that by assigning a logical place for each face when they are created. The LAYOUT is now (to some extent) decoupled from the application logic.

dsunanda:  and GiuseppeChillemi (GiuseppeChillemi) I have put together a little experiment using your sample as a starting point. It uses the 'extra facet to 'tag' objects.  Runs fine within Direct Code. Just not sure if the naming of VID objects is a show stopper for you. On the plus side all of the tagging can take place semi-automatically within Direct Code when the objects are created. Some sort of table viewer for the VID objects I think would make the underlying semantic structure easier to understand. See: [direct-code-gui-demo](https://gist.github.com/mikeyaunish/36ac8389101b726ab91125db5754c53b)

Thanks - that looks good!

My aversion to naming VID faces may just be an ancient prejudice - dates back to when REBOL was spelled in all caps. Back then, the you were limited to 2000 word names. I broke that limit once when dynamically generating words, and had to spend a day refactoring the app.

I also retain a degree of wariness when it comes to polluting the global name space; one day, modules will make that fear obsolete :)

On another point, which may say more about the way I build apps, and nothing about how you should continue with yours.

I have several sub-apps (my term) that independently (more or less) do things to a face tree. A resizer, an undoer, a debug tracer etc. Plus whatever data the actual app needs save against a face. All of these could, potentially be squabbling over the EXTRA space, or overwriting each other's data.

My current solution is to make EXTRA a MAP, and have a simple access app (called FRED) so each sub-app can save their own data independently.

FRED is here if you want some idea of what I am talking about:

Hi, everyone. Take a look at this code
It creates text boxes and images on the left pane, both can be dragged
You must give some properties for the text box via a dialog box
Use mouse's secondary button on a text box to edit it's properties
For doing that, I take current text box properties and 
"put them in a parameter" for the dialog so it can setup its faces properly
Then pressing Ok should modify the text box via text-box-reset function but it doesn't. 
I can't see why

Besides, I'm using view lyoText inside the text-box-menu function
but it should be view/flags lyoText ['modal]
However, when I use such statement, it doesn't shows the dialog 
and the application freezes
I can't see why, either

I've been working in both problems since noon and it is almost midnight
Can you help me, please
Thanks

Hi again. 
First, Boris, I think your color conversion code is just great. 
Second, in the next code I use a slider to set the alpha chanel of base named b2 expecting to make it transparent when moving the slider handle.
However, the base gets darker till black, though the alpha portion in the tuple is getting the right value.
I noticed that happens when I initialize the slider data with 0%
So I decided to initialize it with 1% (or any value other than 0), up to 100% of course...
and it works. Why?
Third, in the same code. I want to leave a margin between the texts in the boxes and their borders.
I use some extra spaces, leading or trailing the texts, as you see.
Well, there is a left margin in the yellow box but not a righ margin in the cyan box. Why?

I can tell it is related to wrapping, e.g. you have a text `"abc def"`, and it doesn't fit into a single line, it gets split as `"abc " "def"`, so when you right-align it naturally you would expect `c` and `f` to be aligned. Hence whitespace must be ignored.

* The point is that opening whitespace <> all other whitespace in the general case. And I can see the same behavior in the word processor (TextMaker).

Hey Redbolers! There are way too many smarties among the Redbolers. Feedback is mucho appreciated. Apologies ahead of time if this is not the "right" forum for this stuff. 

I have this block! of blocks in a file:

```
. db: load rejoin [home %mikado.dbf]
 ≥ ∏À£  [
    ["Bob Smith" "ABC" "bob@abc" #7321234567] 
    ["Jane Doe" "XYZ, Inc." "jane@...
```    

which you can see loads

```
. probe db
[
    ["Bob Smith" "ABC" "bob@abc" #7321234567] 
    ["Jane Doe" "XYZ, Inc." "jane@xyz" #8055551212]
]
```

and here are some db helpers to make pseudo-unique word! keys 


```
make-key: function [
	b [block!]
][
	to-word enbase to-string checksum rejoin [
		b/1 either not string? b/4 [to-string b/4][b/4] 
	] 'CRC32
]

add-keys: function [
	dbf [block!]
][
	;; generate keys for all recs
	keys: map :make-key dbf
	
	; now zip b/c of hacky laziness for now
	zipped: zip keys dbf

	;; now deconstruct a bit
	dout: copy [ ] 
	forall zipped [append dout zipped/1/1 append/only dout zipped/1/2]
]

```

So when applied to the db, we get a keyed db

```
. kdb: add-keys db
 ≥ ∏À£  [ODg5OTg1MjY4 ["Bob Smith" "ABC" "bob@abc" #7321234567] LTE0OTU3NTI2MDk= ["Jane Doe...
```

Now, if we make hash! and map! versions

```
 . dbh: to-hash kdb
 ≥ ∏À£  make hash! [ODg5OTg1MjY4 ["Bob Smith" "ABC" "bob@abc" #7321234567] LTE0OTU3NTI2MDk=...

. dbm: to-map kdb
 ≥ ∏À£  #[
    ODg5OTg1MjY4: ["Bob Smith" "ABC" "bob@abc" #7321234567]
    LTE0OTU3NTI2MDk=...```
```

So if we wish to find stuff in either version:

```
get-key: function [
	name [string!]
	telno [issue!]
][
	to-word enbase to-string checksum rejoin [name telno ] 'CRC32
]

get-rec: function [
	name [string!]
	telno [issue!]
	db [hash! map!]
][ 
	case [
		map? db [

			either rec: db/(get-key name telno) [
				return rec
			][
				print "not found!"
			]
			
		]
		hash? db [
			either found? rec: find db get-key name telno [
				return second rec
			][
				print "not found!"
			]
		]
	]
]
```


Which one is better, faster?

```
. get-rec "Bob Smith" #7321234567 dbh
 ≥ ∏À£  ["Bob Smith" "ABC" "bob@abc" #7321234567]
. get-rec "Bob Smith" #7321234567 dbm
 ≥ ∏À£  ["Bob Smith" "ABC" "bob@abc" #7321234567]
. get-rec "Jane Doe" #8055551212 dbh
 ≥ ∏À£  ["Jane Doe" "XYZ, Inc." "jane@xyz" #8055551212]
. get-rec "Jane Doe" #8055551212 dbm
 ≥ ∏À£  ["Jane Doe" "XYZ, Inc." "jane@xyz" #8055551212]
. get-rec "Marina Hebiishi" #8054905050 dbm
not found!
. get-rec "Marina Hebiishi" #8054905050 dbh

```

The introduction of map! in Red has me a tad puzzled as hash! seems to give one the same thing, except hash! keeps series! meaning (er, semantics) while map! does not, though the people at red-by-example say otherwise: [https://www.red-by-example.org/#mapxex](Red By Example, map!)

I should be more clear. It's slow compared to loading Red data, but it's also not as fast as some other langs. This is by choice, if not by design. That is, we *could* write the parsers in R/S, and make them much faster. But they would also be much more complex, and would then not be available as great `parse` examples. And once you start dealing with higher level types, adding extensions to make them even smarter, etc. it's a good tradeoff to keep them high level.

rebolek (Boleslav B≈ôezovsk√Ω) did some great work on CSV, and hiiamboris optimized the slowest part of the JSON loader with some R/S in a `routine`. That's another great example for people, of how to use R/S only when needed.

The CSV codec is an example of how we need to be flexible in the face of "soft" standards and real world data. Also how we can provide different output formats that match different use cases, all with minimal effort on the user's part.

https://gist.github.com/rebolek/e9c718175a0c60c1ec1a6e1a97d8cd2c has performance tests and comments from rebolek (Boleslav B≈ôezovsk√Ω).

The proposed XML codec has similar tradeoffs. I'm OK with all these performance results, because there are ways to deal with them in the real world. e.g. pre-load and save as Red data. 

All this being said, dockimbel doesn't like the codecs being "overloaded" with options, but I can't see a better way around the flexibility they need. With very strict formats, like images, resulting in a single datatype of `image!` the basic OS loading covers 99.99% of use cases. That doesn't hold true for CSV, and means we need to think more about codecs, options, and how to merge simple and flexible.

CSV is complex. JSON not that much, maybe it can be made faster, I don't know, but CSV? That's a beast. 
What could help? String slicing. The ability to load a binary blob and then just reference it instead of copying everything, that would be a huge win. If course, that would be a fundamental change (not impossible, but hard, I guess).

There is no standard resizing system. hiiamboris has written one, as have others IIRC. `face/size` should be all you need to get or set. And `foreach-face` is your friend.

Also, from my exploratory programming, it seems that it is not enough to ask to proportionally change the sizes of the gui elements. It appears that a complete refresh is needed to let view auto place the elements on a new sized window container. Is that not right?

I tried the foreach-face [ ] and failed to get updated placement. I can watch the sizes change , however.

Yes, that I observed. However on resizing, faces to do not resize proportionally from their start ratios as the container resizes by either click on the window decorator maximize provided by the WM (Fluxbox) in my case. 

Faces will resize downward, if the initial container size is something proportionally less than screen max, e.g., 99.999%.

Faces will resize downward, if the initial container size is something proportionally less than screen max, e.g., 99.999%.

However, none will resize "in place" as the expected behavior. IOW, the automatic layout only happens at start and not on screen re-write. Overlapping happens of faces. 

No doubt you and Nenad know what is going on exactly and perhaps qtxie.

hiiamboris in %table-test.red, it looks like `#include %../red-view-test-system/elasticity.red

In any case, the idea for `table!` comes from tables in Excel: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/overview-of-excel-tables-7ab0bb7d-3a9e-4b56-a3c9-6c94334e492c

But not the rendering side, only the data side. Of course, once you have the datatype and interface to that, creating a generic UI mapping for it should be almost pre-defined as far as functionality.

You can think of it like a mini-spreadsheet, or perhaps a domain-specific spreadsheet. e.g. rather than thinking about per-cell formulas, you think in terms of rows and columns, mapped to a consistent 2D data array.

A `table` datatype would solve a moltitude of problems you have implementing it as `map!` (the order of columns over all), or `object!` (the name of column which is limited) or as `BLOCK!` of `BLOCK!` as the presence of headings as first block, `copy` could truncate rows, indexing, searching, sorting... 

[18:53:01](#wBOAgq_BHfc8hjeAs8AO8alcs-l2LiUXnmZu7fY1G-Y) <GiuseppeChillemi (GiuseppeChillemi)>:
Also I think of `foreach [a b c d] at table 55 [if b = 33 [d: 44]]` for easy processing of rows

lnxw37d4: Thanks! Yes, data frames are related to tables, very closely in some ways, and is something we need to keep in mind when designing them. That is, data science is here to stay and Red needs to think about how to support that domain use, with datatypes, libraries, and dialects.

A key difference from spreadsheets, which someone may correct me on, is that data frames don't prioritize (and may not support) formulas in cells. Spreadsheets give you full control there, and tables fall somewhere in between. That is a spreadsheet doesn't favor data or formulae for any given cell. Data frames consider only data in cells, with external access for filtering and function application. Tables are for data, with some common meta features, like headers, filtering, and aggregation cells.

Something else to keep in mind, which can be very nice for humans, is combining/stacking headers.

Good question. Maybe there isn't anything worth bringing over. Surely there are some fundamental parts missing from the current Red roster?

Unfortunately that will never work. As Rebol and Red are languages more close to human than to computer, AI will always hallucinate when trying to generate some Rebol/Red code.

The answer to that is just more sophisticated AI models, which can infer the language rules and follow them, instead of probabilistically spitting out word salad. But we're not there yet

As small thing. In your `read-write` (often called `copy-file`) you have the dest file first and the URL second. In Red, arg order is up to you, of course, but look at how others consistently order them. Subjectively it's from most important to least, or with source elements first and destinations after that. And since it's called `read-write` in your case, it sounds like it reads first, which it does, so putting the URL param first matches nicely.

that's because historically `red.r` compiled as `red.exe` was also a Red script runner, so it considered arguments coming after the file to be arguments to the script itself

I thought I share that here. Deliberatly decided to go with a `parse` based solution.

nice to have the Red implementation, but as an offtopic - the algorithm itself seems to be wrong Ì†ΩÌ∏Ö. I mean, it does not preserve the input array, so it is not exactly the same sorting as we would normally assume

[14:05:32](#wr6UXSrp-SwaVY7ojGfElSeNCDNW-lLfH7Gm-yf0Aj0) <bazub>:
On a practical side, if I were a user with a list of entries, and after a sort some of those entries would be gone - I would be mighty confused

[14:07:34](#b4o6ponyrsjC-ej4mbzUgNxtljAUUyZvFGWZPCfI43E) <gurzgri>:
Of course it's a destructive algorithm, but in Red we'd usually avoid destructive operations by `copy`ing, don't we? As in `stalin-sort copy values`. I put "(modified)" in the doc-string.


[16:50:15](#qNqe3BirrHcmGfw1rBnyPR7W5gchq1tgd_7g46zCYco) <bazub>:
Yes, but the original array remains unsorted, and you return a sorted, yet broken one (missing values). 

So when the author boasts about O(n) sorting, implying this is something to be compared to traditional sorting algorithms - he is misleading the audience a bit. This destructive sort might potentially have some edge case uses, but it is by no means in the same league as traditional sorting approaches.

[17:28:54](#Y9U6zBQaTDHpeDf7wRTjfVEODLiTA-lV7Y5PFvcmjhs) <gurzgri>:
Obviously that whole stalin-sort thing is missing a parental advisory `/s` marker just to make sure that people get the tongue-in-cheek-ness of the repo. You do, do you?

Hi there, guys. I'm cosacam1. I have had problems trying to enter the red/help chat. Sometimes I've been able to read but not to post. But recently I have only been aloud to enter red/red. Anyway I haven't enough time for programming in Red recently, anyway mostly because of the frequent and extended blackouts in my country.

[23:16:02](#oKc7PP8Vy5YB16cuRZzGR9nhN_o4v41cqqTSFWGsA2E) <Cosme A. Caso Mach√≠n>:
I know objetc aproach in Red is not by classes but by prototipes.
However with make <object-name> we get some kind of inheritance.
Take a look at the next program.
I define a couple of classes (so to say)

```
Red []

father: context [
    a: 0
    b: 0
    init: func [_a _b][ ; kind of a constructor
        a: _a
        b: _b
    ]
    add-them: does [return a + b]
    mult-them: does [return a * b]
]

child: make father [
    c: 0
    init: func [_a _b _c][
        father/init _a _b
        c: _c
    ]
    ; netx, override method, but using ancestor's
    add-them: does [return c + father/add-them]
    div-them: does [return (c / (a / b))]
]

; program begins here
by-copy: copy child [init 10 20 30]
by-make: make child [init 100 200 300]
probe reduce ["before in by-copy..." by-copy/a by-copy/b by-copy/c]
probe by-copy/add-them
probe reduce ["after in by-copy..." by-copy/a by-copy/b by-copy/c]
probe reduce ["before in by-make..." by-make/a by-make/b by-make/c]
probe by-make/add-them
probe reduce ["after in by-make..." by-make/a by-make/b by-make/c]
print by-copy/mult-them
print by-make/mult-them
print by-make/div-them
```
This is what I get. Why?

```
["before in by-copy..." 0 0 0] ; ok
300 ; expected 60
["after in by-copy..." 0 0 0] ; expected 10 20 30
["before in by-make..." 0 0 300] ; expected 0 0 0
600 ; ok
["after in by-make..." 0 0 300] ; expected 100 200 300
0 ; expected 6000
0 ; expected 6000000
; finally, I expected next to be 600, not error! because b should be 200
*** Math Error: attempt to divide by zero
*** Where: /
*** Near : (a / b)
*** Stack: div-them

There's no classes in Red. Thus `father` is not a class but a completely separate object, and it has its own words and works on them when you invoke anything with the `father/` prefix.

greggirwin (Gregg Irwin): looking into the RSC2 and Nodec-gc branches, the changes seems to be so significant, that if it leads towards the Red being self hosted, plese, guys, think about calling the release 1.0 already.

I have at times doubted if Red would really advance towards 1.0. This was mainly because there was no great progress in the main branch. I _could_ of course have visited all the other branches regularly, to be more reassured. Alternatively, the Red team could from time to time tell us where and how they are working on the various enhancements.

ldci (Fran√ßois Jouen): As for 64 bit support, I think that it migh be actually coming. Most probably in the first phase, Red is going to be able to emit code for 64 bit targets, but internally slots are going to be still suited for 32 bits.
As for the Text-UI, I can see it otherwise - it is a great example of how something like VID is well abstracted, so that is even possible. There are embedded guys, who might welcome Text-UI over the terminal input / output. I know it is not for everybody, but I would definitely not depreciate its availability.

For me, 2026 will be the target year for Red64. When there, the Red foundations will be on par with the current tech world. Yes, I think we need something for moderns coders like the python data libraries. A way to bridge those libraries would be nice to use the Red/Rebol with them.

We often resort to preallocation of buffers in Red, and then using `/into` refinement to fill them, thinking that otherwise it would be inefficient to fill them with data, as every time a buffer is filled up, it has to be fully copied. 

But how inefficient exactly? 

I made a [script](https://gist.github.com/hiiamboris/ac6fd823883a534573526d203387385c) to measure that, and it turns out that for any case where you fill the buffer by one or a few items at a time, you'll *never notice the difference*. The only cases where it affects performance are when most of the buffer is filled using a single Red instruction, thus copying speed is compared against R/S buffer filling speed. And even in this case the performance loss is less than 20%.

Occupied memory size however can be doubled without preallocation, as expected. So in practice, if we approach the 1GB size of the buffer, only then we should care about prellocation.

I made a [script](https://gist.github.com/hiiamboris/ac6fd823883a534573526d203387385c) to measure that, and it turns out that for any case where you fill the buffer by one or a few items at a time, you'll *never notice the difference*. The only cases where it affects performance are when most of the buffer is filled using a single Red instruction, thus copying speed is compared against R/S buffer filling speed. And even in this case the performance loss is less than 20%.

Occupied memory size however can be doubled without preallocation, as expected. So in practice, if we approach the 1GB size of the buffer, only then we should care about prellocation.

Measurement results are nearly identical for [red/master](https://link.storjshare.io/raw/jxfnjjold7d4xtoupll4mp7ychkq/img/PXhVXkJ.png) and [red/nodes-gc](https://link.storjshare.io/raw/jxfnjjold7d4xtoupll4mp7ychkq/img/91SYdTd.png).

The only branches that are active in the last few weeks are: 4 branches whose names begin with node-gc, and 1 branch rsc2.

Red-view is slower than the CLI version, because console events are involved (processed when one use `wait`).

Also Rebol's `dt` includes call to `recycle` before running the code.. (to reduce the chance, that GC is fired in the middle of the measured code evaluation).

:) My "work" is a simple technique using ON-CREATE to populate a map that relates faces to their purpose, eg:
```
   field 200x20 ""
   on-create [put gui-map/entry-fields "user-name" face]
```
That enables some useful things (such as generic functions to iterate through all faces of one semantic type for initiation, or to log their values for debugging, etc).
We're still awaiting someone really clever to find an easy and elegant way of mapping between layout and semantics. 
That could be any of us!

ldci (Fran√ßois Jouen) Red works with two 'kinds' of files. 'Local' files which are basically strings to show to the user in a familiar form, and are encoded using `string!` datatype. And `Red` files, which is the format understood by Red functions and natives, but which is not familiar to the end user. 

When you're receiving data from the environment or input field or in any other way from 'outside', and you know it is a file, then you have to let convert it into Red format using `to-red-file`. When you want to output it, feed to the shell, use `to-local-file`.

Do not just patch your code by `to-file` calls to make the argument checker happy, because `to-file`, like `to-integer` or `to-block` is just a datatype conversion, it is completely unrelated to `to-local-file` and `to-red-file` convertors.

Hi kavina computers I like how you are exploring and learning. I found in my exploration that a "record editor" that pops up as a requester is the most flexible and consistent way to go. I am hoping the next version of Direct Code will be robust enough to interface with your table creation work.  My long term intention has been to connect with a Red native data storage solution. Keep me in the loop with what you are creating.

kavina computers: , thanks for all your work on a table style! Great progress.

We don't have an official VID extension system yet, but we should. I will ping the team on it, as even simpler compound styles (like physical addresses) are very useful to standardize.

Historically, one of the trickier aspects, which benefits greatly from a design standard, is how internal events are mapped to events that come *out of* a compound style. Many the user may not need to see, but it's also a certainty that *someone* will want to hook them to extend extensions.

As with other coercions, and what Boris says, you can create values that aren't lexically valid or loadable. e.g., you can't *write* a path with a single value. Paths are (historically) intended to be a series of values, with a minimum of 2 values in them. As a block type, *could* they have just one value? Sure. And your suggested syntax is probably as good as any.

So, while it may seem easy to add `/` to single-word paths, it may have deep ripple effects and design choices. e.g., if you `get` a single word path, is that an error or does it work like a word? It's an incomplete "path", but not a word, as it's a block type. Sort of like `[series ` with no closing bracket. 

Should things evolve? Of course they should. But this is also where Red needs to decide what is generally applicable, and what is the domain of dialects to control. And making sure that supporting one idea doesn't block others.

Your accessor system is a very cool idea but, like a lot of Boris' work, it's specific to more in your system and design. So we can't be hasty. Not that we ever are. :^\

We also have to be very careful of how custom systems may not work well with standard Red. e.g. your `<--` operator likely removes the `+` at the head of the partial path, so you end up with a standard path for `get` to work against. So, if someone builds a path using `to path!`, the `+` will still be there, and if we add `/` and create a "single value path" case, now `to path!` will result in `series/+/:idx/:column` or `series+/:idx/:column`, or, if it's partial path aware it has to *not* return `series//:idx/:column`.

Starting a path with `+` is also an edge case to consider, along with other special chars. Technically, it's not special, and you can use `+` as a word on its own. Handy for dialects. But, today, you can't do ` +: [a [b [c]]]` and access it with `+/a/b`, as something in the path eval fails. `+/a/b` is a valid literal path, and useful in dialects/systems like yours (again, a clever design on your part), but we run up against Red itself when evaluating it.

I was following the red lists closely a few years ago.  Then did not have time to keep up. Now, got a new PC and was in need of something rebollike for prototyping.  This time on a M3 mac which I really like.   But, I really don't know how to get any of rebol/red working.  How is the port to 64 bit going? Is there a  branch I can try?  
Since I could not find any red/rebol working I serched for other similar languages to use. I found Boron which is surprisingly similar in syntax to rebol.  Other from similarities, is  there a relation between the projects?  Boron seem to be possible to complie (no restrictions with 32bit), though I have not managed yet.  Unfortunately, Boron momentum seem to be low, no commits the last three years.

hiiamboris: has a number of ideas out there for embedded `skip` and `part`, to create things like slices. It sounds like you're talking about a compound type, which can be built at the mezz level, but what I think will happen is that it becomes a different language in the long run. That is, Red datatypes are *meant to* be combined from more basic pieces. What you may be talking about is something like what CLOS does, via everything being an object and using its MOP (meta object protocol).

Except that it doesn't come for free. Now every block carries extra cost, even if it doesn't use it. And your sidecar data is a second class citizen, rather than designing a more general system.

Boris's approach is completely general, and specific to the need for knowing the skip size for flat blocks, which is a real pain point in some cases. 

With yours, also consider that having the columns included (unless your sidecar can ref external blocks, which won't work as I see it) is that every data record has a copy of the columns sub block, blowing up the overhead.

First, patch `attempt` and try it yourself. It's a mezzanine, so that's easy. `Try` isn't so easy, but you can wrap the native in your own mezz to start.

Here's the problem I see. Parens evaluate *before* the func calls, so you then *have to* use `quote`, which, at first glance here, makes thing harder to reason about. Now you may ask to have both of them change to a lit-arg to prevent evaluation at the call site, but that's another can of worms and (likely) a breaking change.

Hello, I've been looking to download a redc binary but the downloads page is broken on the main site and I have been unable to find a mirror. I checked the github, saw that no binaries are distributed in the releases section. Also saw that to build a binary I would need a rebol license and encapper which is no longer available on the rebol site. Could anyone here provide a binary please. I'm aware I can also build red programs using the rebol executable and was able to build hello.red, I would just prefer using the redc toolchain if possible.

That would work locally to compile Red scripts. But in case I'd like to give someone else the possibility to compile scripts on the fly (like for a custom DSL), I'd need to distribute *red.r* and the *rebol* executable as well, and the latter's license might not allow that.

In reality you need C skills even for the FFI... You must know the API, you must know what is struct, how memory is aligned etc. It may be useful to interact with some easy bindings, but not with some complex one.

Red is a data format first. That data is often structured. Other common data structures are JSON and DOMs. In those domains there are tools like

`*Query`, e.g. [XQuery](https://www.w3schools.com/XML/xquery_intro.asp) falls under [FLWOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLWOR), which also covers LINQ/SQL. `*Path` is at the core of the universe for all things XML, and others follow suit. Basically, the path notation is a shortcut for full FLWOR.

Another hierarchical structure we use all the time is file systems (which also works for some DBs). For that we call the pattern-matching interface [globbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming). More than one of us has written libs to deal with this. In the days of long-ago, MS had a cool test product with a function called `FileList` which let you build a list of files, using various criteria, then you could work against that list (a block) to us.

For us, once we have a list of things, life is pretty easy. We roll these things as we need them. e.g. `keep-each` is just `remove-each+not`, and how did we ever live without `collect`.

But could it be even easier? And could we unify a lot of it, if not everything?

The implementation will have some challenges. We have objects, blocks, and maps to contend with. But we also have amazing opportunities, as we can offer so much more on how data is matched. That leads to the interface. We can start with a dialect, of course, as that's what a path-based interface would boil down to.

With so much prior art out there, we should be able to come up with a shorthand notation is that is both familiar and idiomatic. The devil is in the details of

Red's UI model is not a DOM, but a tree of faces, the [markup codec](https://gitlab.com/rebolek/markup) that @rebolek built, along with the standard JSON codec, give us sources to play against. e.g. markup DOMs have attributes as well as text contents, which are important for querying.

Literal paths pose challenges as an input, but we can probably hack around that for now, as long as @DocKimbel doesn't remove `paren!` support in them while we're working. ;^)

What do you think might be the best path forward for Red, in these domains?

> But could it be even easier? And could we unify a lot of it, if not everything?

IMO, only by trial and error with lots of real world data. Starting from DBs and then specializing into filesystems and Red data queries.

And I don't believe in a single one-size-fits-all solution in this space. E.g. I have my unfinished [morph DSL](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-common/src/branch/master/morph.md) for decoders, encoders, tree rewriters and ultimately persistent data projections. But would I want to see it when dealing with XML data? No, it would be too verbose for the task. With XML I used a combination of path-based tree filtering and iteration I called [xslice](https://gitlab.com/search?search=%3D%3E&nav_source=navbar&project_id=30941805&search_code=true&repository_ref=main). Why? Because XML is introducing a lot of complexity unrelated to the data I am dealing with and I want to see as little of that as possible. Paths are ideal for that: I choose what I want to keep, but everything else is silently discarded and that's how I want it. I think the end goal, as well as the level of complexity introduced by the data layout, will determine the tool.

I also think if one needs to use a query language to work with UI, one is doing something very wrong.

Another key difference is that many DBs have a non-hierarchical model. Of course, RDBMS is no longer the only solution people think of, and the many DB approaches are all quite different.

* Speaking about paths (literally) - wouldn't it be possible to add slicing for accessing series by using a `point2D!` and `point3D!` types as an index?

```
>> b: [red orange yellow green blue indigo violet]
>> b/(1, 3)
== [red orange yellow]
>> step: 2
>> b/(as-point3D 1 5 step)
== [red yellow blue]
```

Negative values could indicate counting from the tail and negative step - going in reverse.

So MS said it was forbidden in their terms, in 2020, and others can fork and abide by whatever the MS license terms apply to VSCode, but they no longer get this feature and have it maintained by MS. Not sure MS is the bad guy here. MS, as I understand it, never said VS Code was full FOSS.

I recently watched a Dave Plummer video on how OSs are all basically free now, to get and keep people on the platform and sell them other things. That sounds a lot like what got MS in trouble long ago, but it's OK now because everyone does it. Apple started it, so MS chose to compete the same way. Where does that leave Linux? 

What happens to the world is Linux goes away, because FOSS devs refuse to be exploited any longer? On the other hand, Cursor has raised ~150M in VC and is valued at $2.5B, in just over a year, so I don't feel like I can shed a tear for them.

Full disclosure, I have ethical issues with AI being trained on the world's data without permission, attribution, or compensation, while commercializing it all. Legal? Probably. Fair? If it were *primarily* for the betterment of mankind, that's one thing. But it's not.

We are like sheeps entering a fence end then the one who control the gate will close it and ask money for everything, removing freedom.

Once you are inside the function, there is no communication with the outside world. So neither `lit-arg` nor `get-arg` can be used in a function to mimic the Redbol reduction process.

Adopting the LIT-ARG in specs, you have another problem. If you wan t to manage a `PATH` you never know if it is a result or an argument.
```
>> f: func ['l] [l]

== [make function! [[]['y/1]]]

Hello, I'm new to red lang and I'm trying to compile to windows, however the standalone .exe would not run.

It's not the fault of the module behavior. What we need is a way to report the error when using `-t Windows`. Also the `load` should make a warning when cannot find a codec for the mime type.

Thanks Ì†ΩÌ∏Ä. I saw Red on HN a little while ago and I decided to check it out. I used to develop professionally for the public sector (healthcare) maintaining Java Web services and a webapp (Tapestry, ugh!). Had to step away to become a full time caretaker. Now I do it for fun and to keep my brain active. I'm trying to develop a modification GUI utility for Super Metroid and started with Flutter, but didn't like Dart (having to litter "async" all over your code just to use the stdlib...). I checked out Kotlin and liked it pretty good and actually have some of the back end done in it. I looked at Red though and was *really* impressed by the integration of the GUI with the language itself and the ability to deploy straight to an exe.

I got one of the PortAudio samples working so I'm going from there. My goal is to reproduce the minimum working sample I started out with on the Kotlin side, where I decoded the voice sample at the beginning of the game ("last metroid in captivity, the galaxy is at peace").

[5:56:29](#KLb8pedG28A8t41Ejebx9ySEEWXKdRLU9507aJmCr3s) <Les Baker>:
Well, this really seems like an overlooked gem even in the current state. There's not a lot of options for cross-platform desktop GUI solutions that doesn't require diving into a separate ecosystem. Especially on the Kotiln side, KMP/Compose Multiplatform comes from the Android side and requires a little bit of a familiarity with that. And Flutter is it's own rabbit hole.

We are still researching those areas, as they relate to how little Red data is out there, and how domain specific training data is layered on larger, general LLMs.

The "default autocomplete" your screenshot is showing are suggestions of global identifiers (indicated by the abc word icon), see [Types of completions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/intellisense#_types-of-completions) .

Language server suggestions really should sort before these abc suggestions. Sadly I too can't figure out which config might interfere here for you here.

Apparently, the extension does not show any suggestions when the menu is opened this way, but only if I start typing.

Well, it's a trick question. :^) Neither is great, and both come with major pain points. Syncing lists and adding editing will be an issue, and then you run into the fact that native lists were not meant for that use case at all. Individual fields are heavy, and only needed when editing. So the best solution is draw cell contents on demand, then overlay a field when editing.

[My fork of table-template](https://github.com/mikeyaunish/table-template) based on toomasv  table-template uses  `base` as the foundation of the table, with draw doing some graphical work. I like the work you are doing with a native table. I can see that this kind of GUI component could really lend itself to feature creep. The native Red code for toomasv version is already over 3000 LOC. Is there some sort of "natural" break off point where the native table can end and the template version can take over? Not sure about this but it would make sense not to duplicate efforts here. What do you think?

[19:17:21](#YcNGOzn2RvYWty6AIrN6u9ng00K7lkxVuYC7ZFUUFng) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
Tables are one of the most complex UI elements, because they can be so many things, and have so many features. Decades ago, a company wrote a new spreadsheet app, which was amazing. The goal was to take on Excel and Lotus 123. They failed, even though the tech was amazing. They ended up splitting the core tech out into VB custom controls and did very well. More than one company built table widgets for VB, each with a different approach. 

So there is no natural breakoff, because how features are implemented goes top to bottom. We can build tables to do specific subsets of all this, which will happen. Ultimately, the one to rule them all has to be something like what hiiamboris has done in `spaces`, because it can do anything. That comes with a different set of costs, but there is no limit to how you can reframe and wrap its functionality.

So I'd like to implement something like that all in Red so the program will continue to run 50 years from now without any external dependencies. 

Here are the specs so far:

- Cell editing
- Column headings
- Columns hiding (show only selected Ones)
- Optional virtual row Numbers
virtual row numbers: sometime you have IDX in the original table, sometime you have not. So you need to have an identifier. It could be a virtual one, an identifier added just for temporary identification purpose, so that when you filter it you can find the original row. I better explain. If you filter a query and have a view on the data and you must access the original element, you need an identifier. So a virtual identifier is a necessity
- Click and double click events, Right mouse and middle mouse support
- Cliccabile buttons on the side of cell
- Position keeping when opening the grid (Important)
- Filtering
- Insert/delete one or more rows or columns (rows are more important)
- Jump to edit a specific Cell
- Read only columns
- Cursor navigation
- Keys combination support
- when data is sorted or filtered, a link to the original data like an index  should be kept, so you can delete/modify the root data via code
cell based actors
- ACTORS SUPPORT. Each actors should have access to x/y position of the Cell, x for the row, y for the column.
- AUTO CELL COLORING:  in LIST-VIEW of Vid Extention Kit you can render a cell or a row using a funtion. I mean: if a cell has i.e. a negative value, you can draw the cell with a red background, or you may change the style. This feature is really important as important content may be made evidend.
- If button on the side of a cell Is too difficult, you can postpone It. We can use key combination or a submenu show by the actors code managing mouse events
- Selection should allow one or more with progressive selection without SHIFT.
- Selection should be possibile via code.
- It would be nice if each cell could be either like an excel one or as other faces like FLAG, RADIO.
- I am working on a datatype system but it is actually more a group of table management functions in an object. Pick\* data row column and poke\* data row column :value will handle the reading and writing of cells. So you will have remove\* insert\* append\* for rows and columns. If possible, It would be nice if your inner functions could bridge external data.
I mean: if you expose a context like ctx-action with command: data: row: column: value: extra: result: and run a block of code bound to it, we can use any kind of data
Another solution would be to have specific actors for each action you perform on data, so you can use other code and return a result at the end of block
- Also, but it is not important for now, it is a feature even Rebol2 had: sub face/cell drawing. I really don't need it ATM but it is worth includind some foundation for it in the design.

An important aspect of Red is that it is a data format first. With Lisp, people say "Code is data and data is code." With Red, we say "Everything is data until it is evalulated." 

Where this comes into play is with blocks, lit-args/words and get-args/words. You're already using these, so the next thing to think about is whether you want to use a lit-arg here, which means no quoting for the caller, or if it's better to be more explicit, and maybe even have the user pass a func via a get-word. 

As you go deeper, you'll also see that refinements have to be considered, which played heavily into the design of `apply`: https://www.red-lang.org/2023/06/dynamic-refinements-and-function.html

How to check if a 'word' is native or built-in?
What if built-in words get replaced by us? Anyway to revert it back? 
What are some guidance in coding in Red so not to replace built-in words accidentally?

[19:58:39](#Gn1c4ghxWEPRGactCFZz8Gwd944_OO7jpTY8dsO2Dno) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
In Red, there is really no distinction. If something is written in Red/System, it is an action, native, or routine. Do `help datatype!` in the console to see a list of datatypes. Then you can do, e.g., `help action!` to see those, etc. Red doesn't have `protect` implemented yet, nor modules, to keep you from overwriting system words.

This is also very important when it comes to scoping, which Red doesn't have. Oooooh. More tricky stuff. Red *looks like* is has scoping, and we often call it "definitional scoping", but it's really all about words being bound to contexts, and that they maintain those bindings. How much do you want to break your brain today? ;^)

What we often do is hold a reference to something, so we can replace it. e.g. `sys-print: :system/words/print`, then you can still call the standard func that way. If you *reuse* a standard word in your own context/object, that's perfectly fine, and it will "shadow" the global word, which you can still reference via `system/words/...`.

Here's a more or less general version:
```
arg-type!: make typeset! [word! lit-word! get-word!]
arg-type?: func [x [any-type!]] [find arg-type! type? :x]
args-of: func [f [any-function!]] [
	parse spec-of :f [collect any [keep arg-type! | [refinement! | set-word!] break | skip]]
]

curry: function ['f [word! any-function!] x [any-type!]] [
	if word? :f [unless any-function? f: get f [do make error! "expected function argument"]]
	unless all [
		at-arg: find spec: spec-of :f all-word!
		arg-type? at-arg/1
	] [do make error! "function is nullary"]
	after-arg: any [find next at-arg all-word!  tail at-arg]
	body: either block? body-of :f
		[copy/deep body-of :f]
		[compose/only [apply quote (:f) (args-of :f)]]
	set/any/only context: object compose [(to set-word! at-arg/1) none] :x
	func copy after-arg bind body context 
]
```
I leave it as a reader's exercise to figure out why it's written as it is ;)

What it does show indeed is that while Red is well optimized for the common use cases, it largely lacks reliable intermediate primitives for changing how it operates, and there are way too many quirks to consider when writing library code. E.g. `words-of :f` or the long lamented lack of safe function application without the risk of double evaluation or non-evaluation (in case of lit-args/get-args). It certainly would have been more elegant in Ren-C with its `frame!` datatype.

One can ask though, why even bother with partial application if we can just write `add1: func [x] [1 + x]` which is in no way worse than `add1: curry + 1`? Besides, this way would also allow us to set refinements if we wanted to (a much more useful case).

Test:
```
>> add1: curry + 1
>> add1 2
== 3
>> const3: curry add1 2
>> const3
== 3
>> dir-root: curry dir '/
>> dir-root
	C/                  	D/

	S/                  
```

You can have lazy evaluation too, but it's better to do it explicitly rather than accidentally:
```

== 4
>> add-rand 1
== 2

Well, you jumped right into the deep end with code manipulation. :^) In this case, I would start by making sure you know what you want the result to look like. Imagine you have to debug a curried func. Do the names line up and make sense? Do you know it is a curried version of something else? Could you use `apply`? Then play with lit-arg vs get-arg vs having the user control that. How does each affect both the call site and the implementation?

Back to the curried func. I have no idea it *is* a curried func, do I? So how do I even know what `1 2` mean in the sub-func call? So now, when you curry the func, consider what you would put in a doc string.

- We don't let function docstrings exceed a single line. They are reminders, not a replacement for proper documentation when it's needed.
- get-args doesn't need a spec copy as it doesn't modify the spec.
- what if you want to pass `none` as one of the arguments?
- what if you want to pass a word, path, or a literal function as one of the arguments?

The reason to use currying is to fix one of the args. :D
No type checking for now, to curry a function you need to know that function. So, you should test it  first with the original function.

`quot` is a tricky term, as it is also used in Lisp as `quote`, to suppress evaluation. Red has `quote`, but I would prefer that to be `lit` as "literal" is already part of our terminology with `lit-word`. Red also tries to use full words when possible, though not always of course. e.g. the choice of whether to alias `absolute` as `abs` has settled on not having the alias as standard, but people can create their own or use it in dialects. `div` also has a different meaning, as in layout (HTML). Red doesn't use it for that in VID, but something like it could exist. Also, just the abbreviation doesn't make the difference in behavior clear, which is another goal.

Thus far only `and/or/xor` are op words, which is another design choice. People do create infix ops that use words, some in very clever ways. Rebol had prefix versions of `and/or/xor` that had a trailing `~` in their name. That ended up being more confusing then helpful though (my opinion).

Using a pair makes less sense, in this context, but it's great to see you thinking about how to leverage datatypes. A block would be the better choice here. Need a strong case for why it's worth including the func, as it's not highly leverageable. It's also a fine example to put in a cookbook of some kind, for those who want it.

In Rebol3 there is `try/with` which accepts an block of code to be executed in case of error.
In short circuit functions I often have the following scheme:

```
		all [
			attempt [name: to-file face/text]
			exists? name
			attempt [content: read name]
			attempt [master-table: load-csv/with tempo ","]

What about adding `attempt` a `with` so a failure can run code to better explain what has happened and take action? Example:

```

			attempt/with [name: to-file face/text] [err: "Error in filename"]
			exists? name
			attempt/with [content: read name] [err: "Error reading the file"]

This code cannot serve as a good example as is not what you would usually see in quality software. First, it's logic is broken: if `exists?` fails, `err` is just `none`. Second, it is convoluted enough that you yourself do not see this flaw. Third, 'print and go on' is not how you usually handle errors. Usually the error must pop up until some higher context that handled the user interaction, so you want these errors to be thrown. For example:
```
fail: func [msg] [do make error! rejoin ["Reason of failure: " msg]]
unless name: attempt [to-file face/text] [fail "Error in filename"]
unless exists? name [fail "File not found"]
content: read name         ;) native message has more detail than what you provide anyway, so let it be

On Setup and validation of data, when you do multiple checks makes things very readable, it helps a lot. I can see it because I often use gui/file validation constructs and as you know I suffer from symbols overload. When there are too many phrases which are not schematic and expressive, I have difficult reading. In this way, test is in left, error on right, printout of what has happened is at the end. Also phrases are less than half screen long and quick to read.

I will just add that `attempt` is a mezzanine, so feel free to patch and play in your own environment, so there are more real world examples available for discussion.

Error handling is all about choices, as there is no right or wrong. Consistency is key, even if Red offers different approaches. That is, a single codebase, which includes modules and libraries that may come from others, will be a nightmare if different approaches are mixed.

Changing `attempt` is a micro-view, where we need a systemic view of different ways you can handle errors, how to document that a particular func/module does it, maybe adapters for integration purposes (I haven't seen that done that I recall), and cookbook examples for people to follow.

This wouldn't be a huge change, but I don't know how much value it adds.

The only answer is to write some code with the result coming from the check block. It is shorter and more concise than conditional returning the result with the evaluated block. You immediately know what is happening and you don't have to look at the end of the line on the right.

The current object event system should be replaced in a future iteration by a more flexible observation system, so not part of current work on objects. Currently, overloading global context with events could destroy the language general performance if some global words are set by some critical code paths in the runtime (haven't looked, so I'm unsure how much of a minefield it would be). Anyway, a user global counter with a big loop could be enough to have catastrophic effects. Therefore that would be a quite dangerous place for events generation.

Another approach could be to extend the object changed flags to `system/words`, but again, you would probably get a lot of unwanted words in the resulting block:
```
>> obj: object [a: 1]
>> reflect obj 'changed
== []
>> obj/a: 2
== 2
>> reflect obj 'changed
== [a]
```

From what I see, languages like OCaml, F#, Elm implement it using `|>` , Haskell using `&` . So it isn‚Äòt quite a shell-only thing even if it might has it origins there. If applied wisely it might improve code readability as much as it can degrade readability if overused. But that is true for long chains of "traditional" Redbol like function chaining too, which reads in opposite reading order.

Some comments: 
I am 71 years old, and I've been looking after fragile babies for about 50 years using C, Pascal, Modula, Delphi and Redbol languages. 
I use Rebol 2 (since 1999), Red (since 2011) Rebol3 (since 2020), which are fabulous languages. I've been helping Rebol and Red since the beginning of the adventure (Rebol Dev Con in 2003 and 2007, see https://www.rebol.com/article/0333.html), but unfortunately these languages are still ‚Äúhobby languages‚Äù.

Carl Sassenrath (Rebol) and Guido van Rossum (Python) belong to the same generation.

What is the difference? 
From the outset, Python was open-source, whereas Rebol was not.

The consequences? 
Python was chosen as the preferred language for learning programming and enabled the development of various libraries. All my young students are proficient in Python.

What can we offer? 
Rebol 3 maintained by Oldes is fabulous because it can be compiled on different platforms, including 64-bit ARM platforms and others. However, Rebol 3 does not have an effective GUI, even though there are a few tests available for Windows.This limits the development of professional applications. You have to play around with the modules (blend2d, opencv...) to get something that works. 

On the other hand, Red has a very user-friendly GUI and a draw DSL, but unfortunately Red is still 32-bit, which limits its use on modern platforms such as Apple's new processors. I still have a MacBook Pro running Mojave (10.14.6, which is the last version to support 32-bit applications). I use this machine to maintain redCV.

Many of the first developers gradually lost interest in Rebol or Red. Many talented young developers have joined Red now (no names mentioned...), but their work is not highlighted on Red's website. Many of the contributions are old and are no longer updated in line with Red's progress. Personally, I have always made sure that applications, such as Face, or libraries, such as redCV, remain compatible with new versions of Red (currently 0.6.6).
The documentation for Red remains fairly sparse. The latest update to the Red/system documentation dates from 08/09/2022. 

We need a more effective documentation system (something as https://about.readthedocs.com).

[12:06:27](#CZNJDSdb38CJaVzR_wn-IjDa0Mqpw0zO1zyHVV51W6o) <hinjolicious>:
We need to promote Red more... In schools, etc. 
I think Red/REBOL is an awesome language, has a lot of potential, very powerful and ground-breaking in many places.
