Ports are coming soon, with the full I/O work, but COM ports haven't been specifically discussed. R2 supported them, so you could start there to get some playtime in. Not saying Red will work exactly the same though. You can also seen some [GPIO R&D](https://www.red-lang.org/2019/07/gpio-port-for-raspberry-pi.html) done by @dockimbel last year.

R2-Rebol 2? For the "Write-IO" / "read-io"function, the port must be open. Com COM port? What argument should be in the "open" function? It seemed to me that these functions are for working with port isernet connections, such as "http://site.com:80". Or do I need to open the device's system file ( "\\\. \ \ COM2 " or "COM2:" on Windows and "/dev/ttyusb " on Linux)?

Hi. I've been trying to learn how to program for a while, but always seem to get busy with something else. I just recently stumbled upon REBOL and then Red. Would Red be a good first language would you recommend learning something else first?

[17:52:33](#Vkk7nF0UIrKHoyuJ8D0i4pFUHz23rCj0uxi4iqHucuw) <Red-Beginner (Civan)>:

Red has a lot of people who are friendly and will try to help you along. If you decide to stick with programming you will end up learning about more than one language over the years

[18:28:53](#qEn8h5rYYaqrgERRpDxLayiClogRJ-62Kt9fftOgMcg) <gltewalt (Greg T)>:
Have you tried any languages, or just looked around?

[19:04:13](#Z9_yyDPm57PaA-O-yxVnYA-u0x1Eysqg6ee2bvFvP8I) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
Welcome @JohnBlood_gitlab! It won't hurt you to try Red, but you should also try other languages. One of them may click in your head more than others. It also depends on your OS preference and what kind of programs you want to write. If you're on Windows and want to write GUI apps, I don't know what else comes close to Red. If you're on Mac, note that we're 32-bit only so won't run on Catalina. Older versions of OSX are fine.

If you try other languages first, don't let them turn you off of programming if you don't like them. Red is like BASIC or Logo from earlier days of computing, making it more accessible for exploration and learning. Other langs very much expect you to be, or want to be, a full time programmer. Not everyone needs to do that. It's a good thing to learn *something* about, and see if you like it.

A nice thing about Red is that you can just drop the exe on your system and you're good to go. Use the automated build, not the old "stable" version which is quite out of date for fixes and features now. 

The first time you run Red, it will compile a local console you can play in, so be a little patient. Startup should be instant after that.

@rebolek many reasons, for example
1) I really like the technology, I want to "touch" it all.
2) Compile scripts
3) Use encryption (http://www.rebol.com/docs/encryption.html)
4) Perhaps I can solve the problem with access to sites via SSL3, for example
```  
>> read https://gitter.im/red/red/welcome
** Command Error: SSL Error: error: 14077410: SSL routines: SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO: sslv3 alert handshake failure
** Where: build-port
** Near: system / words / set-modes port / sub-port [secure: true]

@Sergey_Vladivostok_gitlab 
1) I understand that :-)
2) If you mean Red scripts, you don't need SDK for compilation. Free Rebol is enough. I can give you the details, it's really easy. If you mean Rebol scripts, SDK doesn't really compile them, just bundles then together with an interpreter.
3) That's Rebol's encryption which was last updated about ~10 years ago, Red doesn't have all the stuff yet, but it's getting there.
4) Again, are you talking about Red or Rebol? Rebol hasn't been updated in ~10 years and SDK license won't help you with stuff that's newer than 2010 or so (TLS 1.x for example) . Rebol can't and won't deal with it, sorry. OTOH Red can, be it in the current version or with the comming full IO.

@rebolek Unfortunately, Red has not yet reached some of the Rebol2 capabilities that I need at the moment. It seems to me incorrect to talk about the obsolescence of technologies and the Rebol2 platform. About SSL - if Red is written in Rebol (I could be wrong), then theoretically i can take the required part and use it...

Red is absolutly not written in Rebol. It works like that - Red gets compiled down to intermediate Red/System code. Then Rebol is used to compile it down to the native code for particular target platforms. The code is agnostic, which means you can use Win OS to compile down to Linux or OS-X.

[7:09:23](#r6OnW2AA0oQArUzlLUpsyxeU77Xgk83xR-hMqPZ0VJE) <pekr (Petr Krenzelok) (@pekr-556ae86715522ed4b3e131b2:gitter.im)>:
Sure, it is kind of written in Rebol, but that absolutly does not mean, it shares any of the Rebol shortcomings. Simply put - Red has https, security is going to be done to modern / recent terms. You can't fix Rebol 2, as it is long time abandoned, not anymore updated, and closed source. So Rebolek is absolutly right with his remarks.

Is Red on par with R2? Well, not yet.

You can also use `load`, and the codec will be applied automatically based on file extension. If you use a different extension, you can use `load/as`. The codec uses `load-csv` internally but doesn't support `file!` arguments directly. Just a small typo in @dsunanda's example.

So `load %file.csv` is like doing `load-csv read %file.csv`

Hi everybody, does Red have a function to write from blocks to csv (the opposite of load)? 

[15:06:23](#5mmmDoP3vTpz23JW2Dlo_7i55xMFTq367WVUqbhmqXw) <dsunanda (dsunanda)>:
@Slownite Yes - to get it as  a string, witg various formating options:
```
 to-csv/with [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]] tab
```
To save direct to a file with default options:
```
save/as %my-file.csv [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]] 'csv
```
use HELP TO-CVS to find all the options

@dsunanda thank you very much !

[19:10:54](#fNA-BrjDa5Hnzgq59JWsXrOaxoYYfFn2LKsWwoVDscw) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
If you use %.csv as the file extension, you don't even need `/as`.
```
>> save %temp.csv [[1 2 3][4 5 6]]
>> read %temp.csv
== "1,2,3^/4,5,6^/"
```
But if you're saving to, e.g., a string, you need to:
```
>> csv-str: copy ""
== ""
>> save/as csv-str [[1 2 3][4 5 6]] 'csv
== "1,2,3^/4,5,6^/"
```
Red lets the user control things with `/as` but if you do `source save`you can see that it uses the extension for files and URLs. `Load` works the same way, but uses the mime-type for URLs.

Hello everyone, I try to do an interface for drawing plot and other stuff, for this I would like to create a window with a base of the size of the window and I want it to be able to resize the base when the window resize but I didn't find any way to programmatically have the size of the window, is it possible to have it programmatically?

You bet. https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/view.adoc#event-names lists all the events. For windows rather than faces, it's just a bit more involved to set up the actors.

These are always hard calls. MS officially stopped supporting it 7 years ago, including things like security updates. It's less of a target now, but it also means more and more effort goes into working around issues, or holding back new features modern OSs offer.  But this is also the benefit of FOSS, as we look forward. If you come to depend on Red, especially as a business, and we stop supporting Win10 in 15 years, you aren't stuck. You take that code base and can still fix any bugs that might affect you. True, you may not get new features, but that's where things like paid support come into play.

Float support in pairs is a design possibility. It comes up a lot. One of the main issues is that they look really ugly. We have to weigh how important that is against the value they bring.

@toomasv, the macro approach is cool, but `some integer!` probably isn't that useful as a rule. :^) I think this is where evaluation complicates var-args in Red. Not that we can't solve it technically, but they may end up being harder to read, especially if any lit args are involved.

[19:37:36](#UixbRMngZ74WJ-fEvTsx7ekquG4WgVxIPq3Re0pL7sI) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
Free ranging evaluation just means there are no parens around args for function calls. So you can't tell when an expression ends without knowing how many args each piece consumes, and whether they themselves are evaluated. As far as being elegant, is Lisp an less so just because the bracket is one token to the left? `(my-fn 1 2 3)` vs `my-fn [1 2 3]`.

There are a number of tree loaders people have done. If you need absolute paths in a flat list, you need to prepend the current dir as you walk. 

[1:46:38](#d-QvUd73Jrbv4Fo3jD2IYAvFR5OgP-yI6DV6fpuHv8o) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
Something like this:
```
all-files: function [
    {Returns a block of fully qualified filenames for the directory.}
    spec  [file!]   "Starting Directory"
    block [block!]  "Block to append to"
    /deep           "Recurse sub-directories."
][
    spec: dirize spec
    foreach file read spec [
        f-spec: repend copy spec file
        either all [deep dir? f-spec] [
            all-files/deep f-spec block
        ][
            append block f-spec

In this version, if you pass a relative path as the spec, that's used. If you pass an absolute path, that's used, so you are in control. If you want to use `clean-path` your walker needs to change to the current dir you're reading as it goes.

@toomasv  Thank you. And, as you say, "result in this loaded block is not bound to context of f. Therefore it is expected to be found in global context". I tried to redesign the function `f` with  `func` rather than `function` to make the variable `result` global, but it does not work either.

@lylgithub2021 When you use `func` then the same binding problem applies to `x`.  It is local to `f` but loading it from string without explicitly binding to the context of function leaves it global.

You would reference `keep` defined by `c` object. If you tried `c.keep` before creating object `c` with `keep` in it, it would error out.

@lylgithub2021 thanks for the console use case. As @hiiamboris notes, when you start creating dynamic code, you may wander (unknowingly) into the parallel universe of binding. It's stepping off the lake's ledge and plunging into the depths. :^) 

Red uses "definitional binding", meaning that *where* something appears in code (where it is defined) matter. Here's your code, with the block moved inline with `collect`. By doing that, Red knows to bind `keep` so `collect` can use it. Look at the source of `collect` as @hiiamboris suggested.
```
filter: func [a-func series  /clean ] [

Less performant, perhaps, but why do you think it's a hack?

> Is it so complicated to add "then" in Red?

Yes. But let's start with your use case. What is your goal?

> I am just wondering. Maybe by adding libuv ? That one lib could solve problems with web server, client and IO stuff.

Technically one lib, but...

1) Add CMake to our toolchain to build it. And learn it.
2) Add static linking of object files from other compilers.
3) Build libuv.
4) Design Red's I/O, and map that to libuv. If we have mismatches in what we want, adapt that to libuv's model.
5) Stay in sync with both CMake and libuv.

The upside is that it's well known and battle tested. If there's a shared library version writing a binding for it should be doable for those who want to use it. But it looks like the project doesn't do binary releases. The downside is that our own I/O work is in really good shape and quite far along. At this point, moving to libuv would take more time than finishing it.

I'm looking for a way to insert the required exe file into my program, something like sfx, which can be extracted from the program after executing exe files. Now the only solution I know of is to read binary files with the `read/binary` command. Then save them in a variable. Then write them as an executable file

[2:16:40](#_jsrWNp2ziYJKS93qOkO9EbFjHGK2IZ9xYwMnUvlKgA) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
Yes, there's no `#include-binary` at this time. Ladislav had that for his R2 version, which was useful at times. In Red you need to `read/binary` the file, then `save ` the resulting binary value in a new file so you can include it.

[16:24:15](#4nTbZt9vy5QP04t9OZzUX5Y1ZIZcKnST2x6xIv7CM3Y) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
ARM is a working target. We don't have anything on ESP or AVR.

Red/System is a C level language. If your hardware is tightly constrained you can write purely in that and have total control. If your hardware has more memory, you can leverage Red and it's high level runtime, mixing in Red/System as needed for performance or hardware access.

Whatever you do / program in Red and try to compile, compiles down to Red/System intermediate language first. Then there is a second stage compiler, which compiles R/S down to a native code. You can eventually use R/S directly for some low level stuff too. The reason why Red does not support 64 bit yet, stems down to the secondary compiler - it does not output 64 machine code yet and needs to be rewritten / adapted. Sorry if innacurate by the guru measures :-)

What is probably meant by the "C-level" is the fact, that in the end, it produces the native target platform code. In comparison to some GCC and such, there is a little to none optimisations yet. So far, R/S apps are claimed being cca 4 times slower, than the C app counterpart. After the compiler gets some optimisations, it might get into 1.x-2 times slower ballpark ....

@leibniz:matrix.org Don't confuse implementations with languages.
- Red/System is a DSL of Red. Red being dynamic and versatile, while R/S uses a subset of it, giving it a strict meaning
- Red is implemented so that it compiles down to R/S. R/S being a bit lower level language than C, allowing you to work with hardware directly.

I think itâ€™s perfectly fine to start with Red :) You may find a lot similarities with lisp but I donâ€™t think you need to learn it first to understand Red. It actually may happen that you will learn both at the same time

You should be fine starting with Red. It is also enough different from Lisp that you'll have new things to get used to. It's fun to play, and when you come across something that seems strange, ask in red/help. There are a few main design points that are fundamental, and it's a rite of passage to find them. :^)

Hello, is there a way to extract the names of variables from this code, not their data? 
```
ra: reduce

    a1: "x"

[9:21:31](#BgGFhCjV4HsLDCxrI0nAb1oE5E8EEnCDJvugvdQGFBk) <toomasv>:
@ams02468 It is possible until you haven't reduced the block, e.g.
```
ra: reduce ar: [
    a1: "x"
    a2: "x1"
    a3: "x3"
    a4: "x3"]

extract ar 2
;== [
;    a1: 
;    a2: 
;    a3: 
;    a4:
;]
```
Or, if you create a context:
```
ra: context [
    a1: "x"
    a2: "x1"
    a3: "x3"
    a4: "x3"]
words-of ra
;== [a1 a2 a3 a4]
```
But if you first `reduce` the block, you'll have only values in the block and words referring to these values in global context.

Ren is not a language, it is just a data format. The idea was to create kind of next gen JSON format, or at least the one, which could be shared between the Redbol lang implementations. Author of Rebol, Carl Sassenrath, defined a new initiative in that regard, called ASON - https://altscript.com/

@3dc1d3 the idea was to make implementations of the data format in different languages, it was done in time when Rebol development was dead and there was no Red yet. And I still think that having loader/save for rebol-like format for i.e. Python, Javascript etc makes sense.

[15:50:16](#MSl93Y9ubVBBFr5TEmYcOxRHzBY828DRcEv2rdFW_n0) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
Also, because people feel strongly about their languages, but not so much their data formats (except us of course :^), they may be willing to use a data format outside the context of Red, where if we push them to use a Redbol lang, they may write off the value of the data format as well.

The difference the quote makes is that it's a `lit-word!` value, which is normally treated as a symbol and not evaluated. In the header, you *can* use it but don't have to.

One thing though: i'm not running it from the gui console, nor interpreted (but as I mentioned that does work fine).

Words can be bound to only one context at a time, so if you want a global reference to it, use `set`. You don't have to have an internal version as well, but it may make things clearer. Eventually we'll have modules (big design space, so lots of R&D), where you'll be able to declaratively express this. In the meantime, many of us have old `export` funcs.

If we change "implement" to "design" this is more correct. It's not hard to do because of Red's limitations, but because of it's flexibility and rich set of datatypes. Every day we run up against questions about what is most intuitive for a human user, but which may conflict with consistency in the language. And we are *incredibly* fortunate to have a team and community where different people focus on each of these aspects, argue their merits in a civil and patient manner (most of the time anyway; we are human after all. ;^), and understand that compromise is often the best path forward.

Also, at least on Windows, changing series in reactive source does not trigger the reaction unless explicitly referred to by set-word (tried also `deep-reactor`).

This is a common error and understanding why it works this way is very important. If you define a function, its body is a block of values. You can still access them. Let me explain with some code:
```
>> f: function [str] [append "." str]
== func [str][append "." str]
```
Now letâ€™s take a look at the body of the function:
```
>> body-of :f
== [append "." str]
```
Append a dot and take a look at the body again:
```
>> f "."
== ".."
>> body-of :f
== [append ".." str]
```
See? The body changed. Let's try to change it directly:
```
>> change next body-of :f "__"
== [str]
>> body-of :f
== [append "__" str]
```
And try to append now:
```
>> f "."
== "__."
```

As you can see, by appending to a string, you are modifying the original string. This is very important to understand. If you donâ€™t want this to happen, use something like `append copy "." str`.

Only those practicing the dark arts should cause themselves problems with func body modification, though I've never heard of anyone doing so. Perhaps they just vanished when it happened. The basic "why you have to copy" issue is something everyone trips over at some point, but is also fundamental to Red. It's a great rule for static analysis tools to include.

The main reason to prevent these kinds of modifications is security. As soon as we start talking about untrusted code the rules change. But simple copying of func bodies isn't nearly enough. We need systemic thinking and design to hold the gates.

I ran it with 1M items as well, which showed that this crude profiler doesn't work very well. What felt like a full minute of wall clock time reported ~0:0:2.5. @giesse's profiler may do better. It may have been waiting for the GC in the console, since the `anon` reported used 1GB of memory use.

A value has to exist before it is *evaluated*, but you can have references to a value in any order. This comes back to the fundamental concept in Red that everything is data until it is evaluated.

If running as admin didn't work, then I don't have any other ideas. When we issue a `call`, we can only know what the OS tells us about success. That said, it's quite possible that something *internal* to Red's `call` implementation has some effect. If it works for Boris then it will take some research. Feel free to search for tickets and open a new one if needed.

The reason for the above handling is that I don't like to compile every time the main programme when the aux.red is modified(for example, `a: 2`, or delete `b`). This works well when running the main programme by interpreter. However,to compile the main programme, `do %aux.red` has to be replaced by `#include %aux.red`.

No, lifting all refinements from one function to a wrapper function. APPLY doesn't help with that. Maybe it's just about using SPEC-OF UNIQUE, when building the outer function header.

Hi everyone, I have an issue trying to install Red on Ubuntu 20.04.3 (Ryzen 7). I downloaded the "Automated builds, master branch" for GNU/Linux and  followed the instructiions for "Ubuntu 18.04+ version".  When I try to run "./red-[my-version] it outputs: "error while loading shared libraries: libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory".

1. remove all URLs from the links block that are external to the site domain, i.e. the toplist.sk URL
2. remove all URLs from the links block that reference an exclude criterion
3. Thus, when done, the block should only contain 2 URLs

I suppose I'd be using parse here? All the examples/tutorial I have seen so far, operate on blocks of strings (or on strings with whitespace).
Can someone give this newbie some pointers?

I don't know if it's worth making INI a codec, but it would be easy enough. Everyone please share your thoughts on that. Then you'd have `load/as <file> 'ini` and `save/as <file> 'ini` available directly. It is a widely used format.

For TOML, we include a grammar for it with [DiaGrammar](https://www.redlake-tech.com/products/diagrammar-for-windows/) (which you can use for free). You can see by the large number of test files that it works quite well. That said, it's just the parser. There are no data collection aspects included to build an output structure. That would be a great project IMO, and whoever wants to do it will get plenty of help. We also have other codecs to model it on.

remove-links [not find/match link data/site]
remove-links [find data/exclude suffix? link]

not-this-site: [not find/match link data/site]
excluded: [find data/exclude suffix? link]

remove-links not-this-site
remove-links excluded
```
And if there are more than a few tests, you might want to do it this way
```
remove-links: func [test][remove-each link data/links test]

not-this-site: [not find/match link data/site]
excluded: [find data/exclude suffix? link]
reasons: reduce [not-this-site excluded]

foreach reason reasons [remove-links reason]
```
And maybe it helps to make sure all your tests are being processed
```
remove-links: func [test][remove-each link data/links test]

not-this-site: [not find/match link data/site]
excluded: [find data/exclude suffix? link]
reasons: [not-this-site excluded]

foreach reason reasons [
	print ["Removing links that are" reason]
	remove-links get reason
]
```

You'll see some subtle differences in these versions (e.g. the use of `reduce` vs `get`) which you and others may find useful as you play.

Happy Reducing!

Since there are a number of easy ways to do it at the mezz level, and performance is not likely an issue if we're talking about display, this doesn't seem like a pressing issue.

Agreed, 100%. This is something that makes open source work, or teamwork of any kind, challenging. It's like the old humorous saying "Be open minded, but not so open minded that your brains fall out." Deciding what to accept and what to reject is not a simple binary question.

Let's find the best place, wiki page or red-by-example, for FAQs like this, and make sure `enbase` is the answer there.

Open questions are things like what @meijeru notes in #3133 and newline issues. Next up would be this one:
```
>> system/options/binary-base: 64
== 64
>> form #{616D73}
== "64#{YW1z}"
```
Red doesn't work like R2 (above) *yet*, but should it? If so, does `64#{YW1z}` become `YW1z` when formed? Now we have global state involved, as we discussed with codec options, where PitL becomes *much* more treacherous. Some lib changes `system/options/binary-base` and suddenly `form` produces different results behind your back.

> I think that if there is mold and form producing same result and people are repeatedly trying to get own solution to have form output, than there is no question to me.

I'd like to see *why* people want this form. What are the use cases? Do we know that?

What I expected, as a reader, was for `form` to present  #{616D73} as 616D73, like rebol.
However...  "#{}" are valid characters in a string. Without `form` doing any extra work, the Red result is technically correct, right?
Maybe it should be the concern of the conceptual "presentation layer". `format`, `print`, etc

Formed values are determined on a type by type basis, as to what is best. We *could* make hard and fast rules, but that would produce more technically consistent, but perhaps less useful results. When `form` says "user-friendly string representation" it's a softer, more flexible rule than `mold`.

I found one place I used it , generating v4 UUIDs. `enbase/base` occurs in a lot of old R2 code, not always base 16. Without digging in, the use case that jumps out at me is emitting data, because other formats, like XML or JSON, may want values as hex strings, and the return value of `checksum` is a key partner there. But that's not really where `form` is best applied, since it's for data interchange.

@Oldes, I think we're seeing the same patterns. 

@ne1uno where are hex colors used as `binary!` in Red? e.g. pixels in images are tuples.

My suggestion is to look at `to-hex` and see if it can be extended (I wish it were a mezz, for easier playing). It's used in the Red codebase is in the JSON emitter, for `\u` chars, but a dozen places or so in %.r support files in the core. It returns an issue, as R2 did, but bear in mind that they were a string type in R2 and a word type in Red. @ne1uno already noted that it's an alternative approach to `enbase`. 

`Format` will likely have hex output support, as a side note.

For now, I'd wrap `enbase`, though we have a number of places "hex" is used in a name, but for different purposes. `form-as-hex` could be a name to use as a playground.

@lylgithub2021 if you want to maintain a reference to the same series, and update it, you can do something like `append clear a load <file>`.

[1:48:23](#BrN31sQv-tTrP6yFIphd4l24eqStzTQJcJWq-etztI8) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
What happens in your case is that the face references the actual series, not `a` (which also refers to the series). 

[1:55:37](#gLia2MrIGk0a7GinjRPAZCLeaECscnie_GNm1GY_3qc) <lylgithub2021 (lylgithub2021)>:
@Gregg Irwin many thanks. I still do not understand why "a" can not be referenced directly.

[2:22:53](#VgzL3ipLSrvbShidAH6MPl_wczEzG2S9p_YSWRFa2YQ) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
It is, as @dockimbel 's example shows. You just need to *change* `a`. 

[2:24:05](#V9BNG14fFbZP4otl4eDWWWoHBMVyEOe_8X4O830GwGA) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
Show your actual code that affects `a` and I will hazard a guess that you are changing what `a` *refers to*, not the original series it referred to when the face's data was set.

So if you do something like `a: load <file>`, `face/data` is like `b` in this example, and doesn't know or care that `a` now refers to something else. It only knows about what it *still* refers to.

Reactivity currently only works on changes in objects and in series (strings, blocks, paths,...). It does not support changes in the global context. So `a: ...` if not enclosed in a reactive object will not produce any event. We don't support it for now as it could impact performances significantly. We might figure out a good trade-off to support it in the future.

The reason it works in my example is because `compose` does not do depth-first evaluation. That is, it sees the paren after `if` and evaluates what is in it, which is a block. That is the result it uses in the output. Because `/only` was *not* used, the outer brackets of the block are not included, only the values *inside* the block. In this case that's a single `paren!` value.

Thank you. I don't find the difference between your code and mine's. In my last message, I said `the second does not work as expected`, that means the content of `text` does not change with the input of `drop-down`(`d2`). So how to make it work under present facets layout.

@lylgithub2021 Interesting, it seems to depend on the order of definitions. Not sure if it is intended. This seems to work:
```
view [
   d1: drop-down data [] panel [text react [face/text: d1/text]] 
   return 
   panel [t1: text] d2: drop-down focus data [] 
   do [react [t1/text: d2/text]]]
```

Yes. There's no `d2` at the time that reaction is processed, so I suppose it refers to the face created from a previous attempt.

`text` changing with the condition of related `radio` is expected when running the above codes. The result(the content of `text` and the appearance of `radio`) of clicking `r1` and `r2` is however,  very strange. Any one could try this code and help me with it?

I guess, this is caused by predefined reactive connection of radio faces, which is broken by explicit `react`.

@toomasv The reason why I use `react`, not the ordinary way , isï¼šwhen `r1: radio with [data: true] [t1/text: rejoin ...]`, the text of `t1` is not displayed initially. `r1` has to be clicked to view the text of `t1`. Then I have to `t1: text with [face/text: either r1/data [...][...]`. You see, the text of `r1` which I want to display has to be written twice. Coding once is preferred.

`/key` is for map use, but also works on blocks, though it doesn't treat them strictly as a key-value structure. That is, there is no implied `/skip 2` when `/key` is used on a block arg. Think of it as `find+remove/part 2` removing the key it finds, and the value that follows.
```
>> a: ["b" "my-key" "my-val" "" " bb"]
== ["b" "my-key" "my-val" "" " bb"]

It's impossible in any language that uses character-based strings. When you find a lang that doesn't do that, let us know. Maybe Wolfram can do it symbolically. ;^)

```
I wonder if there are methods by Red to do something when an appointed time reaches, meanwhile(during the wait) the procedure can go on doing other things, as I tries in the above codes. It does't work as expected. If the button "timing" is clicked, the codes can do nothing(the button "others" doesn't react to click on it) except waiting, until to the given time. Any better idea of this?

You are creating a busy loop in your code which is something you really don't want to do! You should probably setup a face with `rate` which would fire `time` events in some interval and work with these.

As far as easily parsing code, that takes time and it helps if the code is written with that in mind. Soon enough you'll get familiar with the more common funcs and how many args they take, including when refinements are used that may take optional args. 

We often end up writing dense code as we "improve" it, making it less clear in the process. It can be instructive to take standard functions apart, and rebuild them in a form you are comfortable with, to see what makes them tick.

As you read, when you see a function call, e.g. `find`, you need to know how many args it takes. That's easy to find out with `help find` in the console. If you see a literal value, or a word (which refers to a value), that's an arg, easy. If you see another function, its result will be the arg. `help append`. Keep walking and you'll get there. Another thing you can do is take an expression and add parens around calls to see them, as you're learning. The code will work the same. e.g.
```
trace/all [find (append "" (remove (form (add 123 456)))) #"7"]
```
You can also add extra spaces as you see fit, to make the code readable to you.

Faces in View are already reactive, so that if you change or deep-change any facet (like `/data`), it will update the graphic component accordingly at once. See:

```
a: ["A" "B"]
view [
	drop-down data a
	button "Add" [append a "C"]
]
```

If you need to do anything more advanced than setting a value (or making a deep change), then you need to rely on `react` to achieve it. Otherwise, all the basic direct changes are already reactive in View.

Red expects text files in UTF-8. Internal representation is system specific but that's not exposed to user, so it doesn't matter.

Red will (hopefully one day in the far far future) use new IO that's in the IO branch and there's `HTTP-scheme.red` that gives you the same functionality using standard scheme which is is of course much more pleasant to use.

That's a funny date lexing issue, related to the change dockimbel just made I think, as an old build errors trying to load that string.

You can't just `load` any data and tell Red not to process some values. It will try very hard to interpret what you give it as valid Red data. If you know the format, that's what `parse` is for.

I've updated [CASTR/send-request](https://gitlab.com/rebolek/castr/-/blob/master/client-tools.red) with a workaround for a longtime Red problem with headers. Red requires headers to be strictly in `header: "value"` format, otherwise it would crash with `Access violation`. If you try to use a different format, like `"header" "value"`, then see above what would happen (yes, `Access violation`).

Now Castr goes thru all headers and tries to convert them to `header: "value"` format. There's no error-handling, so if your header looks like `!@#(!:!!<` then I'm sorry.

I didn't want to do this update, I want IO to be merged, but that's probably not going to happen soon and people use this so here's the update. I really hope it's the last one, IO should be merged.

saves `~4/1000` of a second. Yes, it adds up over more calls, and that's a bridge to cross when you come to it.

What's most important here is not that the second example is smaller, it's that is has so much more meaning. Trim+split. In the first example you have `[complement charset parse]`, but it's not just 2 funcs vs 3. It's that the `help` for them is much more...helpful. `Help` for `charset` and `parse` will just make you look for detailed docs and the latter is a deeeeeeeep hole.

For me, the most important thing from this topic is that we need a better `split`. :^)

You need to append the suffix yourself, if the user didn't include one. Two reasons: 1) the user could enter one, and if it added it automatically, you'd have no way to *not* include it. 2) the filter for an entry can contain more than one extension. e.g. leave `/fitler` off and you'll see you get both `%.red` and `%.reds` files under "Red".

> <@greggirwin-55659ddb15522ed4b3e1006f:gitter.im> Mark Smith: did `trace` help you at all?

Thanks for your response and sorry for my absence, I got tied up with other things unfortunately. `trace` looks very useful and I look forward to trying it out. I guess what I'm trying to figure out now is how Rebol/Red knows where one expressions ends and another begins and particularly around values and infix operations i.e. there are three expressions in `[1+2 3-4 5*(6/7)]`, and Rebol/Red must know this somehow. Is this done in the parser, or is this also the result of "free ranging evaluation"? Is it possible to define new infix-functions, such that these infix operators are just functions of a different form, or is there a fixed set of infix-symbols in the parser?

[10:51:59](#mAkz-AJe32BapezJ_9xo4dZXrRYf6fra2CQXl8rYqQM) <Mark Smith>:
:-) The absence of a/not being able to find the grammar for Rebol/Red is throwing me a bit here.

[10:55:57](#iapYY0ytlogVL-tLo3Z1u_SRSmP4Ay4nkA5hPxhPczY) <hiiamboris>:
Each Redbol function has fixed arity, so determining expression bounds at runtime is piece of cake. You can't do that ahead of time though, because everything can be redefined.

This may or may not be be too low-level but does that mean that when Rebol/Red encounters a datum i.e. a number, it looks ahead in the series to see if the next word is an infix function, OR is the datum pushed onto a stack with the infix-operator taking it's argument from there?

[11:01:12](#fSBvqRxGLKTYJ8U3nafqw-aDcd7nJVlB207nFDwlZDI) <Mark Smith>:

Both really. E.g. in `print 1 + 2 + 4` you have to look one token past `2` to figure out whether you pass `3` to `print` or keep evaluating.

[11:03:17](#8rSY2b-68ov-MAhnWMf8Y-w0DtE-uU6enngRm5rvcBs) <Mark Smith>:
Rights! So is it `print` that is doing that or something happening at a higher-level?

[11:04:39](#uUW7Ka-8hkV6zmncAtN7wlyzs3KD29C8g-3JKOafQ-U) <hiiamboris>:
The interpreter itself fetches the arguments and passes them to operators and functions. `print` itself knows nothing of evaluation rules, it's just a receiver of values and spitter of text :)

[11:05:33](#keNJiC88mrqwFHex97UCNAyZ1W0LkWgxgIes9ngiRLs) <hiiamboris>:
In this case `print` has arity of 1, so one single expression is evaluated, `print` gets called with the result on the stack.

[11:06:45](#q56J1DuDDSi6rBfCv3ChT2PQICPicghDCWIMcTC9o2c) <Mark Smith>:
For clarity, does this apply to both Rebol and Red? :-)

[11:06:53](#zS6Sgr-q08uGBLeb9FoLKcXNSYah6CTSl7ikOTqD3mA) <hiiamboris>:
Yes.

Okay, things are starting to fall into place :-).

[11:12:40](#4YR-byOQB4DmnfDHET2CVG6_lHUIGvkNx3MFFpP0k6E) <Mark Smith>:
So all the Rebol/Red needs to do is to distinguish nouns and verbs, so to speak. If it sees a noun then it looks ahead to see if there is a verb that applies to that noun and then keeps going. The syntax is regular (and extremely dynamic!) and determined fully by the arity of the functions (maybe plus a little tag for infix-or-not). In the usual case the arguments follow the function so all the interpreter has to do is to look the number of expressions to fulfill the functions arity.

[11:14:44](#XNM-a_Y6tDN7-h9EUwNPO5Jznttse3M3zj2uqdA7T3Y) <Mark Smith>:

[11:16:40](#O1-wObTqK5yujAXuXW11hRfyVkEWfTRA2wyKuqotbng) <hiiamboris>:
Blocks are passive by default. You `do` them to evaluate, or your function may choose to do so itself, as is the case for many language constructs - conditionals, loops, etc.

[11:18:21](#Idhcy1dHftqWB-YdipJMV5c5rfbU_PL1Ty1OITYnl1A) <hiiamboris>:
I wouldn't invent "nouns" and "verbs" here. It's just words from Redbol perspective. Words are by default fetched, and if they yield a function or operator value, then that function/operator is evaluated.

:-) That makes sense, and I'm happy to adapt to the lingo. nouns and verbs made sense to me, given my personal experience, since everything is a word, but some words are the things themselves (nouns) and some words are actions (verbs, usually applied to nouns).

[11:26:16](#5CsemyQk1uXUy2NsAL9hVEBCn8x-bD9qipL6d9pebMY) <hiiamboris>:
It's purely our convention to name functions with verbs and values with nouns, for code readability. Not enforced in any way.

Until you `load` a file it's just one chunk of text/binary data, so Red's `include` system doesn't know anything about what's inside it. If you want to do something more involved, like extract named elements out of Red files you use as external content, you will have to do that yourself. Then please tell us about your solution. You can, of course, include the entire file and just address the sub-parts. Unless your file is huge you probably don't need to worry about space wasted by unused content.

It works only because you probably keep the compiled exe in the same folder as `%b.r` file. `do` implies that the file is loaded at run-time, not at compile-time.

Red supports `UTF-8` only. If you want to read text in another encoding, you can use for example my script https://gitlab.com/rebolek/castr/-/blob/master/codepage.red?ref_type=heads form the CASTR repo.

However, there's no auto-detection, so you would need to know what encoding is your file using.

Hi! It seems that a map! knows the order of its keys. I couldn't find any documentation about it, though. I'm used to maps which are either hash tables (keys might be returned in any order) or trees (keys returned in sorted order). But `keys-of #("foo" 1 "bar" [1 2 3] "baz" "Hello, World!")` gives `["foo" "bar" "baz"]`, so it knows the order they were inserted into the map I guess?

The order of keys are not guaranteed.

If maps are updated a lot, keeping key order is extra overhead. In many cases, you won't see a difference, and we have to decide which features provide the most value.

As a (very new) user, it would be good to have a note regarding the guarantees of the data type as part of a specification. But I understand the language is still in alpha state, so it's okay. It'll break a lot of programs when it changes, as probably people assume it is part of the design.

As I understand it, a `hash!` *is* guaranteed to keep order, and it's not clear that "keys stored as a hashmap" implies that order is not defined.

You should add map specific info we don't have in datatype, and also a way save and view such info for each map created.

Normally you should not do that. But if have to;

You may disable File System Redirector by using Win API, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wow64apiset/nf-wow64apiset-wow64disablewow64fsredirection
You would need to use Red/System to do that.

Or try `%windir%\Sysnative` which is not redirected. See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winprog64/file-system-redirector

I donâ€˜t think you can already use the toolchain for this, so instead I `git clone` the `red/red` repository, `git switch` to branch `TUI`, add `View` to `environment/console/CLI/console.red`s `Needs` header and `config: [gui-engine: 'terminal]` and compile that `console.red` using REBOL2. Than you can interactively play with TUI in the console and `do` scripts using TUI.

I guess `call/shell/show/wait {cmd /K "dir"}` with GUI console really should do the trick as well as `call/console/show/wait {cmd /K "dir"}` does for CLI console. However, my default terminal application on Windows is Windows Terminal, not the old conhost.exe. At least with Windows Terminal I don't get it to work, the cmd shell opens (and can be closed by typing "exit"), yet whatever I'm trying I do not get to see the output of the `dir` command.

lylgithub2021 (lylgithub2021): From Red documentation (https://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html#section-16.3)

The #include compiler directive will insert the target source file at the current position in the calling source code.
This directive helps split the source code in several files, allowing for example, to put common functions or definitions in a single place and including them where required, across several source files or across different projects.
This is the way adopted for redCV for modular and simple compilation (https://github.com/ldci/redCV)

example: 
```
;required libs
#include %../../libs/core/rcvCore.red
#include %../../libs/matrix/rcvMatrix.red
#include %../../libs/imgproc/rcvFreeman.red
#include %../../libs/timeseries/rcvDTW.red

at present, the first problem is that `#do` does not recognize functions outside it. I can't understand this logic

[5:54:31](#XrjG-FaycJo4IMGuNTZXTgYKM5wd_AKE4JmbGcRUG1I) <hiiamboris>:
The logic is simple. When you compile, first your file is preprocessed (#do preprocessor directive is evaluated) using R2. `#include` is a passive value of datatype `issue!`, so it does nothing. After preprocessing, it is compiled. Compiler replaces its `#include` directive with the file's contents and then performs the compilation and creates an exe binary.

[5:55:17](#ygu92zQg6I7TPSsOhVY8buB8o-awmdvGtqsNxHlIDU0) <hiiamboris>:
Thus, I proposed `#do [do %file.red]` solution, so that that file is evaluated at the preprocessing stage.

[5:57:47](#gz_VhUxTnw3KFb31bwygDALu-0DvKkNT8dyml6SUWpA) <hiiamboris>:
Since R2 is not 100% compatible with Red, it makes sense to extract only the functions that you need to run at compile time into another source file. And rewrite them in a way that they would work in both environments.

You got lucky that it worked for that relative path (a side-effect of our current limited IO support). Red relies on platform-independent file path format. Use `to-red-file` to convert platform-specific formats to Red format:

`view/no-wait` if you want to manually control when to close the window

[21:49:33](#gMKIh3dE4F94i5XOFcgdw1_p0WE43zhyKmZskIc7rMg) <gurzgri>:
lylgithub2021 (lylgithub2021)  The way the question is worded makes me wonder whether the model you're trying to use a good fit: Saying "I'd like to use *a* gui" and "*the* window will stay there" seems to imply that really there is just a single UI / window. Yet with `view` in a loop you're actually setting up *a new* window with each iteration.

If the latter is okay for you, then something simple like  
```
foreach i [1 "first" 2 "second"] [
	break?: no
	if string? i [
		view [
			field i
			button "break"    [unview break?: yes]
			button "continue" [unview]
		]
	]
	if break? [break]
]
```
might do the trick for you.

But if you really want to solve your problem *in only one* gui, that iterative approach won't do and you'll likely need something more sophisticated, because with an interactive ui you're somewhat leaving the iterative paradigm and enter event based interaction processing and find other ways to "loop" thru the stuff you want to process.

The following approach might give you an idea on one possibility to address this:

```
queue:  [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 "ten" 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 "twenty" 21 22 23 24 25]
speed:  5
pause:  does [info/rate: none]
resume: does [info/rate: speed]

process: does [either empty? queue [unview] [refresh string? info/data: take queue]]
refresh: func [state [logic!]] [do pick [pause resume] info/enabled?: okay/enabled?: nope/enabled?: state]

view/no-wait [
	info: field on-time [process] with [rate: speed] return

	okay: button "ok"     [resume]
	nope: button "cancel" [unview]
]
```

* lylgithub2021 (lylgithub2021)  The way the question is worded makes me wonder whether the model you're trying to use is a good fit: Saying "I'd like to use _a_ gui" and "_the_ window will stay there" seems to imply that really there is just a single UI / window. Yet with `view` in a loop you're actually setting up _a new_ window with each iteration.

If the latter is okay for you, then something simple like

```
foreach i [1 "first" 2 "second"] [
	break?: no
	if string? i [
		view [
			field i
			button "break"    [unview break?: yes]
			button "continue" [unview]
		]
	]
	if break? [break]
]
```

might do the trick for you.

But if you really want to solve your problem _in only one_ gui, that iterative approach won't do and you'll likely need something more sophisticated, because with an interactive ui you're somewhat leaving the iterative paradigm and enter event based interaction processing and find other ways to "loop" thru the stuff you want to process.
