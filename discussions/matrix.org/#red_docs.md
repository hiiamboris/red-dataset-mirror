This came up some time back. We can improve things, and having better search is key, but a lot of this is on the user. Coming from other langs is hard, and I still want to have a "Red for X programmers"  series. A quick intro for common tasks would also be good.

Watching it again, and he notes this himself, he's just banging around *really fast*.  

Having examples at the bottom of datatype pages, e.g. for actions, could help too.

I made a list at the bottom. One of the keys to helping people find answers is using language they know. Then we can teach them our nomenclature. e.g. we think of reading URLs, but the rest of the world things of making HTTP requests.

@gltewalt   as regards tasks, there is some  Red material in the Rosetta Code site at https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Red    This site lets readers investigate tasks in a range of languages.  Some of the tasks are bigger than we want here, I think, but some are small - e.g. read a file

I have submitted an issue on `refinement.adoc`which is part of a more general difficulty with the `all-word!`literals. @toomasv pointed out that my treatment in the spec document is now seriously flawed, because the specs for `any-word!` vs `issue!` and `refinement!` literals have significantly diverged. This is now a question of balancing the desire for allowing as much variety as possible, vs. consistency and ease of remembering. If one spells out the allowed characters in detail for each of the types, it becomes painfully obvious (e.g. `##` is allowed, but `/#` is not, `#,` is not allowed, but `/,` is ).

This is now the spec of `<issue-literal>` as deduced from the lexer FSM:
``` 
An `<issue-literal>` consists of `#` followed by a sequence of one or more characters.
It is delimited by end-of-text, whitespace, semicolon, or any character from the set `[ ] ( ) { } " < @` .
Note that any of `[ ( { "` preceded by `#` introduces a (grouped) value of another type than `issue!`.

Restrictions: `/` is only allowed as first character of the sequence, while `<` `>` and `,` are only allowed if they are *not* the first character.
Also, the combinations `<>` and `<â€¦â€‹>` with any characters in between the `<` and `>` character are not allowed anywhere in the sequence.
```
Is this what the designers wanted?

A `<refinement-literal>` consists of a `/` followed by a sequence of one or more characters,
 subject to the restrictions below. It is delimited by end-of-text, whitespace, semicolon, or any character from the set `[ ] ( ) { } " @ : /` subject to the exceptions below.

A `/` followed by one or more `/` and possibly further characters is not a `<refinement-literal>` but a `<word-literal>`. This is delimited by the above-mentioned delimiters and also by `#`. The same goes for a single `/` before any of these delimiters, except obviously `/`. See further <<word,section 5.2.5>>.

The issue is not an error but a confusing consequence of the spec: `//a/b` is a regular `path!` value since the path "head" `//a` is lexed as a word. I would guess that most people confronted with the question: is`//a/b` a valid Red value and what is its type?,  would have difficulty analyzing it. Or am I the only one?

All I have done is put into words what the lexer FSM actually accepts. Whether that is to everybody's liking is indeed another matter. For the time being, I will update the spec document to reflect the current, rather messy, state.

`/a/b` would have to be a new datatype which now even don't have a name... or you would have to kill `refinement!` datatype like HF did in Ren-C and have `/a` as a `path!` (but that is a `block!` type, not a `word!` like `refinement!`)

Also, he is forgetting the importance of code/skill reuse (20 years of Rebol experience); and that everyone needs something stable to work with. I have seen different members suffering from this **experimental stage**. Red is now ready and it has its first commercial application. As things are now, we will see REN-C apps in another 5 to 10 years time frame. I will deliver my fist application *made with red (tm)* just after the new *Android+Ports* release.

@Oldes' `resolve` on @GiuseppeChillemi's gist is very nice.  It gives it a name, is very idiomatically Red, and is simple and elegant.

[2:08:44](#pF8pk3Ug888SZbA17QZ_BHJrTuUENqu29wfT0glyD48) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
I did this a long time back, for the refinement issues @GiuseppeChillemi noted:
```
to-path: func [spec][
	; LOAD FORM is used to clean up specs that have refinements 
	; in them. Refinement values get their sigil doubled, which
	; FORM removes, so they are sanitized. More overhead, but we
	; could make that optional if this func lives on.
	load form append clear '_/_ spec
]
```
It's really heavy though, with both `form` and `load` being used, and was just a quick workaround at the time.

[2:09:24](#riM5B-NV_XF1ve6MMJyRZyl0OJhMWup82I5AD74XIR0) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
@toomasv's `path` func is nice too.

[2:32:05](#0ydrN3sfIeyrnj31cuFWDJF1X_Tcdw6f1uPNfKop6YA) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
I don't remember where the paren-in-path/computed-selector chat was, and can't find it just now, but it is important to note that we intentionally left it out of the `path!` docs, because it may be removed. @Oldes correctly points out a number of issues with it, and allowing parens as the first element in a path's lexical form is very, very unlikely to happen. Coming from @meijeru's notes, I am looking at things from the other direction; how can we simplify rules for lexical forms.

I think what @GiuseppeChillemi wants could be called _indirect relative paths_ or even just _indirect paths_. Now, since words are already a level of indirection, they're really doubly indirect, but that's just more confusing to talk about.

An important aspect here is that paths themselves are not the problem, which we can see based on @Oldes and @toomasv finding other ways to express solutions. The only issue is the lexical form for `path!` values. @GiuseppeChillemi's suggestion of `/a/b` has a big problem in my mind in that *nix paths starting with a slash mean they start at the root (i.e. aboslute), so having it mean relative is backwards to that meaning.

It's true that common cases like `p/(n + 1)` are handy but, unless we make paren path segments a special dialect, their unrestricted power can be abused and hurt readability. Forcing the use of get-word selectors can seem like more work, but the benefit is that the user then *has to* give the selector a name, which is helpful.

So, @GiuseppeChillemi, no need to open a wish for this.

Nenad included paren support in paths for Rebol compatibility but, if we look at Red as a data format, with very tight and sometimes confusing lexical interactions, it does come with a cost. 

[6:54:24](#3jmesVHvvqAkKr5D5Bzjdp2N-Dw5RiuYMaBlB0fKgHk) <GiuseppeChillemi (GiuseppeChillemi)>:
@greggirwin Gregg, you have already asked time ago for examples that shows reasons to use parens and I did it. They are an essential part to have one line data structure selectors that summarize what needs more lines to be expressed. Everything can be abused and become hugly but it is the price of power. I remember me having written hugly parse expressions that made Ladislav gone grazy but the solution was not to restrict parse because  it can be used to write such code, I have simply learned write neat and readable one. So, removing power from a language for this reason, is not the right way to go: we should teach how to use that power, instead of removing it because it can wrongly used!

@greggirwin Also, about "hurting readability", I totally disagree, every day I face the problem of having too much information off-screen.  It confuses me because I have to move back and forth to find what-is-what in structures, words, and logic. It is nice to have "my-field" but coding is not just having a neat name, it is also defining and debugging its content, especially when your path accessor is not doing what it has been meant to do. When you have multiple data structures, it is really handy to have their access logic in one line because the information is all there. It is like function's specs, in the same line you have: `word [types!] "description"`; in this case, you have `name/(logic)/name`! No off-screen data, no scrolling headache, no large amount of new words,  no risk of polluting the global context, and no minding about words context. This is really hurts coding: too many elements to have in mind to understand what is happening and information scattered everywhere. Parens in paths (if done properly) solves this as Carl solved the problem of documenting the purpose of function arguments and types.

`readthedocs.io`

You can connect a readthedocs account to a github account, then can click import on a repostiory.
Once imported it builds out the docs.
Then you have to manually configure a webhook so that docs are updated with new changes.
So, doesn't seem like much maintanance is required, or much manual work after everything is set up.
Workload is mostly up front.

There are business accounts that probably give you more, but I didn't look at that.

I don't know the reasons for starting an account there and then abandoning it - possibly because at the time I believe the docs were in markdown?


Pros:
Free doc hosting.
Webhooks - when code is pushed with Git, docs are built. Stays in sync.
Multiple docs versions - branch or tag with git.
Can build multiple formats: pdf, ePub, html

Cons:
Relying on (or tied to) Python.
reStructuredText is the prefered markup (Part of Pythons javadoc-like attempt). No Asciidoc. 
Can use markdown but it is limited.

@dockimbel @greggirwin 
In the most recent blog post I read (to my satisfaction) the planned  work item:
Red Language Specification (Principles, Core Language, Evaluation Rules, Datatype Specs (including literal forms), Action/Native specs, Modules spec.
Let me reconfirm that the work I have put into the specification document [here](https://github.com/meijeru/red.specs-public/blob/master/specs.adoc) is fully available for use in progressing this work item, in whatever way is thought appropriate.

[20:44:22](#KxAUPGbMS0a-O4t9OlVW6gzaD6u4xOA3ByZY4Cqj-Ro) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
@meijeru absolutely. I imagine that will be the foundation we work from. We want to a) make it clear what parts of Red have a hard, unchanging (as much as we can), spec; b) firmer style guidelines for things like custom datatypes (not including new lexical forms) and how to make sure contributions (including those from the team), align with the big design picture. Finally, c) I'd love to be able to treat specs as data where we can, for more interactive tools, including analysis for new work. e.g. if we have specs we can apply as rules, how do we do that?

In any case, your work will be an important aspect, and we'll certainly reach out to leverage your knowledge and expertise.

	- All words are divided to **3 equal groups**, sorted by popularity.
	- Each word can have **max 6** links to other words or backlinks (links from other words).
	- There can be **only two** (back)links from/to each group per word.
	- Links can be made only to words from the same, or **less popular** group. This means for example, that words from group 1 cannot have backlinks from words from groups 2 and 3, and words from group 3 can link only to words from the same group. This rule could be checked with some **tolerance** (i.e. groups can overlap), like +/-5%.
	- **Links are selected** by developers, backlinks are automatic.
	- For words with less than 4 (back)links, they will be supplemented **randomly** with links to each other. It can be explained by them having one thing in common â€“Â be **unrelated** to any other word.

The chances of it being merged depend on how much the change affects Red, and what @dockimbel thinks. I think the best approach is to get the work out there, in red/code or red/community, or even on their own repos, and build support. It's harder when something affects Red syntax directly.

For this feature, I wouldn't try to make it part of function syntax or doc strings, but as additional, even external data. Then have extended `help` that knows how to leverage it. Another aspect to this is user contributions. If we build it in, and it's part of the Red codebase, it will be harder to change. And the popularity aspect is either set by a designer, or adapts over time.

My instinct as well, because of block parsing. But any words in the files you load become part of system/words, and will eventually blow the global name space.

Any Idea on expected ETA for 64 bit support ?

So in your opinion, would you not recommend trying to build out a commercial application using Red at this moment?
Would it make more sense to choose something like Rebol and transition to Red later on with 64 bit support?

I do really want to try and use this language to support my clients but a little scary not knowing a hard set timeline of when to expect updates to the language, especially the 64 bit support .

Thanks, is that 1 to 8 years OR roughly 1.8 meaning a year and some months ?

do you really require 64 bit to go commercial?

if you tell us what is your planned app domain, we may advise

Probably not from the get-go, but clients are weird in what they require from a application that they will pay for and I have had some come to me and deny services because language didn't support said feature. 

App domain, very user concentrated. Applications that have to do with, real time data delivery and placing orders or requests. So like sports betting, financial trading, etc...

then I would not recommend using Red atm, since it's both single threaded and worse - has no async networking

[18:06:18](#b9GVJHMQKb68UXras-XrZz60RD9QQUqAnho1tm-BuPA) <hiiamboris>:
also it crashes at times or just corrupts its own memory and does something odd..
simple scripts may run for months, but the more data crunching you're doing and the more sensitive that data is (money) the riskier it gets

[18:08:01](#-_ZjSJs5H9ceGBkNSUpJOOMHHNrl_9ZzYn5kjB2sp5c) <hiiamboris>:
though you still have an option of doing the risky work in the C lib, and using Red for the UI.. just more work and requires system level coding skills

What about Rebol itself? Would the change from building out applications in Rebol then transitioning to Red when more stable not be worth the squeeze, in terms of the amount of work that would be required probably.

[18:10:05](#GLg6O_BMaeX0tCHbDvgP3esNzsrSNXIacMQeanqgO5E) <hiiamboris>:
since the foundations of both languages are very close, it may work, yes

Yes, estimates based on e.g. story points are well established and ubiquitous, but in my opinion, too, itâ€™s a pity that far too less people in the industry are privy to duodecimal time based estimates /s

I have taken a look to the `parse-func-spec` function and found the following rule:

```
attr-val=: ['catch | 'throw | 'trace | 'no-trace] 
```

But it is not present in the specs in following document:

Is this by choice or just an overlook?

Just an oversight. `[catch throw]` aren't finalized, but are there for compatibility and future use.
