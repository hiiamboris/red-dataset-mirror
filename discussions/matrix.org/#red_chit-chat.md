I have good news and bad news. The good news is I had a quick chat with Nenad about it. The bad news is that the request may go the other way. There are 6 series actions that allow `none` today. Not quite 50%. The driving force for allowing it was `remove/select/find/take` for R3 compatibility.

[20:57:13](#LRHH6of8EZ_x0HVhCJGQWKspoot4ivogWW_Mj5_ozQE) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
It's inconsistent today, giving us some comfortable shortcuts but weakening type safety in return. As Nenad noted, `none = remove none ` doesn't make sense, especially if you're new to Red. For this reason, and foregoing R3 compatibility, all series action support will be removed from `none!`. Yes, it makes for a little more code, but improves consistency.

I'm sure this feature will rises again in chat, in the future. :^)

Apologies for any code it breaks.

In looking at the `remove find` cases today, what the idiom *doesn't* do is tell you whether it's expected to fail sometimes. Rather, by using `remove find`, you're saying "optionally remove the value if it was found." Maybe there's an opportunity there.

"There just will be more ill functions like index?? or index?find from mentioned CC." - Maybe then it would make sense to formalize functions that specifically work with indexes, and allow a few useful ones.

On burnout, not in general for me. On specific projects, I've had some slogs but it mainly meant I was much less productive because of partial burnout.

Gitter is in the process of being merged into [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) anyway, which seems to me to have some similarities with IRC, it's federated and open, lots of clients written for it (mostly just Linux though). The main one seems to be [Element](https://element.io/), which is an Electron app, so not exactly light-weight, but it is quite snappy, and runs on many platforms. It's the best experience I've had trying to use Gitter on mobile. There doesn't seem to be any way to log in with the gitter credentials on the Matrix side right now, so that's one down side.

Reading about this project: https://omar.website/tabfs/ it might be a fun project reverse that and build a GUI from a file system. Then you manipulate the UI structure by creating different file types and the file contents would contain the widget state. Directories would be panes. Buttons, fields, etc. would be files. Then you could manipulate the UI by using file system commands. I have no idea whether that could ever be useful, but I think, an interesting idea, nonetheless.

@henrikmk once I have used an ERP that mapped all its GUI functionality on URI, so you could access any of its part and do whatever you want. This could be the same for a Red GUI, you access it as FS and open to scripting tools.

I think Gitter sucks dead rodents through a steel straw.

Slack sucks for the same key reason, which is if we branch (for example this Original Post I'm writing right here right now) it is hard to track and follow, and both systems do a horrible job of making this clear and easy for everyone.

= Data Protection Regulation =

I'm not sure the info (from link) is good.  (nothing to do with ne1uno).

GDPR/CCPC/Nevada (and more to come) all are a complex area (I administer and have attorney review on this).

The best summary I can possibly give is this:

1. Since it is on the Internet, you might as well support the lowest common denominator, or in this parlance, whichever rules are worst.
2. There is no simple flow diagram of questions that helps anyone answer this.  So this is a really tricky problem to solve.
3. There have been no real lawsuits so far, so we don't know what is true.  A law is not real until it is tested.

So, the whole thing is a nightmare.

Going forward, my own plan is as follows (this is very rough):

- Try to connect people's personal data to a UID.
- Try to encrypt the local storage of it.  Use Password 1
- Try to encrypt the long term storage of it.  Use Password 2
- Deal with the conflict of these facts with the goal to allow people to search data easily.

If some ahole demands you remove them (their data), they can control Password 1, and you can just destroy Password 2 rending long term storage useless (or give them the password and then destroy, giving them the power to recover).

Does anyone have a better plan?

There's no good solution to this, and I don't know enough details to say what constitute personal data or the protection thereof. That is, data you can't sign away the rights to by clicking "I agree" on a EULA you didn't read, what rights I have to my content, and whether those are exclusive.

Is there a loophole, where you could provide a service to "manage storage and access control" but the user has ultimate control over their rented space? Kind of like co-location but with an API as well. The user "rents" space, could be a true SBC or a virtual machine, which runs an API "service" the user is in control of. The API is simple (`[insert select change remove]`) but could also have advanced features to allow analysis. The user then has a control panel where they can grant access to data with a key feature being by tag. e.g. you grant Gitter access, which automatically tags all API calls from Gitter with `gitter`. And Gitter can only access data tagged as such. Mashup services can be granted broader access. My local social agent app can write and tag and remove anything, but if it tags something `twitter` because I checked a box to post there, Twitter still only has read access to that entry.

Where this gets messy for those of us who want history frozen, is when people stop granting access, then open it up again, remove data, etc. Then it's up to each system to garnish your reputation and even boot you from their service. So everyone is incentivized to play nice. It opens up a whole new DDOS attack vector. But maybe you can also choose your storage service options, where some or all of your data lives in a blockchain. You could have blog posts editable, but code and contracts auditable. 

And does RAM count as storage? If services can't cache data, their efficiency takes a massive hit, but if it's all in RAM "for current use", then we all invest in memory chip companies. :^)

I'm sooooooooo sorry.  This is why I fear building robots.  I'm amazed there are not far more things like this.
One of my closest friends (who has since passed for unrelated causes) used to build Robots for the show BattleBots.  All the teams have many rules in place to prevent what could be very very very bad.

@BaronRK We have rules too but not the needed one for this particular situation. I was correcting the belt of a new conveyor belt which was crawling on its border. Any conveyor belt has 2 rollers, one on each side, so I have put my hand on the edge of one side and started pushing the belt far from the border. Well, this conveyor belt was different: it had 3 rollers instead of 2, one acted as a counter roller to keep the belt tense. It was totally invisible and unexpected. So it took my hand out of nowhere. After this incident I have added a new rule to the other we have: if it walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, Inspect it before you handle it like a duck, it maybe have a hidden shark mouth somewhere. In other words: not everything is as it seems, inspect it visually at least one time, because known shapes may have hidden dangers.

@GiuseppeChillemi thanks for the detailed info. It may save others here who work with any kind of physical device.

I used to work at a theme park, and asked someone to measure an audio rack one day. A minute later I heard a shout, saw sparks, and the other tech came flying out of the audio cage like he'd seen a snake. Turns out his tape measure, as many are, was steel. What we didn't know is that this rack was old and had bare copper bus bars on the inside, carrying electricity. He put the tape across the rack to measure, it closed the circuit between them, and POW! Fortunately he was fine, but it took a chunk out of the tape measure.

@greggirwin 
Yes, the lesson is the same: inspect everything for both invisible and invisible, especially when it is the first time you are working with it or there is some fault. You have to inspect the visible with eyes, the invisible (electricity) with the instruments. They are a hard lesson to learn. This time it has cost me a visit to the emergency room and one-month+ of difficulties.

I think that the reason is, that `map!` is not the best type for something like JSON, because it requires hash tables.. and as JSON file is usually transferred to map of maps, there is wasted quite a lot of memory and computation to build hashtable for each map.

I was thinking industrial and commercial use. See the internal state of an industrial machine, and be able to make adjustments with the controller. Program a lighting controller via a local access panel, rather than something more involved (e.g., longer runs, net access and security). But it could also be *really* cool for interactive exhibits or competitions. Imagine a "close the circuit" maze game where you control relays but also have the UI and controller to navigate *which* relays you interact with. Now make it a team or competitive setup, where it could be real time or turn based. e.g., a central unit can enable or disable your GPIO signals based on whether it's your turn, timers, etc.

It's funny how long it took [Eliza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) to go mainstream. :^) That said, most online "chatbot" systems are really just menus like @Respectech needs. Even if they aren't great for users, with moderate success in answering, they do 2 things: 1) They make the user feel like they're involved in a conversation, which is good psychologically. 2) They may not answer the question, yet lead the user to think of something that helps them. Almost certainly, even with many sessions still reaching a human, reduce support costs for companies.

What would be a cool next step for them, which must surely exist already, is using user input to train them, so you have vetted data, but also feedback beyond "Did this answer your question?" Instead, let users be even more empowered and tell you what they did or didn't do, along with their ultimate solution, even if that is "I just gave up."

@greggirwin If reference to your question concerning the way my AI works no.  I use Levenshtein Algorithm to match the pattern the user typed.  And then the closest matching pattern from the list of patterns (25,817 patterns now) determines the response along with variable values committed to short term menu from earlier user inputs.  So if the user said they were wearing a red dress. The AI would deduce base on the pattern matched that the AI/Gender: copy "female" such that if I then asked the AI "Am I a man or a woman?" it would answer "You are a woman."  So it's really a BOt technology instead of an expert system technology.   But like an expert system each pattern can have conditional logic ao i you ask "Am I a teenager?" and you've already told it your age it's > 12 and < 20 then it would answer "Yes you're ' AI/Age " so you're a teenger." or "No you're " AI/Age " so you're not a teenager." if the age check came back false.

Is it going to stop false positives in A/V software? Is it some sort of standard, and all software supports it? Will executables released with signed Red be also immune to false positives?

It should stop A/V false positives, yes. EV code signing is a major standard on Windows. Mac does something different now, and Linux doesn't do it at all AFAIK.

> Will executables released with signed Red be also immune to false positives?

No. Not unless we can figure out how to pragmatically provide it as a service, which likely involves code reviews by our team. That is, a signed app is trusted, and the owner of the signing key is accountable. So even if we *could* automate it, as soon as someone puts out a piece of malware written in Red nobody will trust our key anymore. Plus, it puts users at risk because the OS trusted the app because it was signed. So we have to be *very* careful about what we sign.

The answer, which is pretty painful, is that each user needs to get their own key and sign their own apps. On the bright side, we have this process down now (including finding a deep issue that kept it from working initially), and can provide help.

Has anyone checked VirusTotal lately, to see how Red is faring?

I think 512x512 is also supported, at least in ICO files themselves. Huge icons create another issue though. A UPX'd version of DiaGrammar for example, is ~550K. Large icons, just the ICO file, may be 120K or more. So we have to ask how much value they add, and what percentage of space we want to give to them compared to the rest of an application.

Simplicity of deployment for Red (and Rebol before it) is a big plus for developers.  For example, I support some deployed applications whose update process (for bugs or improvements) is this:
1. I send them a (link to a) small zip file.
2. They drop it into the application's folder
3. They restart the app - it notices the zip file, extracts the contents (usually scripts) and then restarts itself
Done!
(There's some fiddly code in there to roll back to a previous zip if the fix breaks things - but that is rare, and mainly invisible to the users).
This makes deploying updates almost trivially simple at both ends. No gigabyye download followed by clicking OK repeatly to a slow installer.

I am a lot satisfied today. I have made my first reusable VID panels Today, in Rebol. They are written in such a way that when we will have multi column text-lists in Red I will be able to port them in short time. I have used the technique of wrapping a context around them, so changing the creation parameters is a matter of setting a couple of words in the context. I can even link them so, when you click on one, the other show you the relevant data. Now that I can manage such complexity in a simple way, I can see the full beautiness of Red and Rebol.

The major problem when you create reusable segments of code is the loss of fluency in code reading.

I've learned a lot in the past decade, not so much about how to do things, but how 'most programmers' (and people) approach problems differently than myself.

Mostly about the fact that humans are mostly task-oriented, vs goal-oriented.  

Permit me this rabbit hole as an example:

How many times have programmers written login code?  Why is this not a stand-alone fully functioning single command?  

(think of all the overhead and code and time of every website out there for login related crap)

Why are logins still User name, and then a separate Password field?

(be careful with your answer, you might as well consider this my Queens Gambit, and if you don't know it, then you lose in 4 moves)

So mostly what I have changed is how I present things, but we are missing a few tools that I believe (hope) will move people (and programmers) forward faster.

Much like there is a tool called a Word Processor (that mimics paper), and a Spreadsheet (that mimic ledgers), I hope a more fully comprehensive Flow Chart system will dramatically change how people mimic 'knowledge'



[16:54:39](#VIkrn8x1AYONam9ua-RqPfByfSkle5mNgUu03WX0bTM) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
I think there's a psychological aspect that aligns with tasks v goals: we're lemmings. Doing something different takes courage, but is also interesting in that it's not good for your individual survival to break with the tribe. It's not just programmers, but artists, inventors, musicians, writers, creators of all kinds. Doing something new and different is risky, and has a higher probability of failure, but it's those "mutations" that drive evolution. 

Software reuse didn't exist on a large scale, though people tried to force it, until the web, JS, and NPM. Maybe we can liken it to a biological system as well. Not a virus, but more like cancer perhaps. Not trying to insult the tech, just thinking about how it works. And like cancer it doesn't have a plan. It just grows until it kills its host. I think this applies to both the users and the system itself, and people have to actively fight this cancer. 

What's tragically ironic is that we, as programmers, don't often break new ground. Not in any significant way. I was reminded of this while doing `split` research; every language just copied what other langs had. But we *don't* just use someone else's, or think about having other use it. This is your task focus at play. We want to do our own thing, thinking our version will be better, but so very rarely think in terms of empathy for others or the goal of the greater good. Is it the biological competitive wiring that makes us "fight" in this way? Is that also why nobody like to do maintenance? Old bushes are picked clean and we want to move on to greener pastures.

What's been missing is a gene pool and a method of natural selection. NPM has a lot of arrows in its back, and `left-pad` (I hope) taught the world some lessons, but someone had to be first in this global mess. I have many thoughts on this. Right now, though, I'll try to change one small thing in the world and see if I can save a few lemmings.

It may not seem so but it's extra complexity.
1. This raises a question of format: name then password or password then name? what is the accepted delimiter? E.g. Matrix IDs were first id@matrix.org, then they changed it to @id:matrix.org and imagine every site accepting it's own format of that..
2. Security from cameras and loiterers and just colleagues occasionally passing by. Password field is hidden by asterisks and it should not be cached by both browser and whatever autosuggestion system your OS incorporates. Totally different rules.

There are many aspects to this. 

First, there is no average user or even use case. Everybody is new to a system at least once. Some people enter the same data a hundred times a day, or more. If you start with a blank page, you can't possibly know what to do, but if a field says "New Appointment:" and you know that means a date and the name, rank, and serial number, you can type `2 wks from today Lt G.S. Irwin #123-456-7899` rather than selecting from a calendar, drop down of ranks, name...does it want full first and middle or just initials?, and 3 fields that eventually tell you there are too many chars in one of them... 

But you'll still get it wrong sometimes. So this is where the world needs to work more like Interactive Fiction. You enter something and it says "I don't know what LEFTENNANT is.", kindly providing you suggestions and, ultimately confirmation about what it understood, narrowing errors as you go. You don't get that today. It's all or nothing. Not "These all look good [list], but you forgot the rank. Since I wasn't busy, I used the serial number to look it up. Sorry to hear you were demoted."

What we have today is rude machines that let you enter 20 fields of info, then slap you in face, throw away what you wrote (not always, but often enough), and say "Wrong! Try again.". Then we have the gall to say we care about UX, even coining an acronym for it, when all we really do is polish turds.

You've probably heard me talk about interrogative interfaces, and that's what I think Reichart is keying into (pun intended). Can you enter an ambiguous IP address? Sure, and the system can say "Either you're drunk again or your cat is trying to SolarWinds somebody. My best guess is one of these: ..." 

Anyone ever hear of Expect? Imagine what this looks like in an automated future. No, really.

'Regarding IP addresses. Is 111111 a 1.1.1.111 or 1.1.11.11 or 1.1.111.1 or ... one of many other variants?'

Let's start with the PROBLEM:

- Usually, this interface is on Security devices, Routers, Cameras, and other places where you are given minimal control or input.

- They often FORCE you to manually TAB or click into the next field.

It is horrible and frustrating for no good reason.

- If all you have is an AlphaNumeric, then let people just type 192168001001, this has 0% failure.
- Nothing should stop someone from typing 192.168.001.001, or 192.168.1.1 for that matter.

'Separate fields exist because they all have different data types and consequently different validator algorithms.'

I shall now attack (En-garde) LOL:

- Name - There is no way to confuse one's Alpha name with CC#, Date, or Security Code.  There is 0% failure here.

- CC# - All credit card numbers use Mod10, and are long enough as to never be confused with Name, Date, or Security.   There is 0% failure here.

- Security Code - These codes are either 3 or 4 digits.  One might argue that this can be confused with the Date, let's go to date to review...

- Date - Credit card forms already expect 4 digits as DDYY or DD/YY.  

Let's say we have a conflict, Amex for example used 4 digits on the back.

0815 0321, ok, so, we let you use them, and let the backend check both.  They are already doing a Mod10 check anyway.  Even if you got them backwards, we can fix that for you.

BINGO - 100% success, you can enter the info how ever you damned well please, and it will process it correctly.

I had an experience this year where I lost about an hour just trying to make an order on the site.  I reentered A LOT of fields like 20 times before it worked. Then I lost a day on people who were more unreliable than their machines Ì†ΩÌ∏â

Or also funny, just from yesterday. We have this most popular (or number 2) online shopping and delivery service, where I order a toothbrush. They sent me an email that it's ready for pickup. But guess what they didn't tell me? WHERE. No address. I logged into their stupid site and poked around for 15 minutes or so - absolutely no info on the address. I found a support bot hidden there somewhere and asked it, and it immediately told me all I ever wanted to know. They're idk like 20 years in business. Such a shame, it's pathetic.

And you think people of such "talent" would design you an intelligent password field that will even look up how long you've been using it and will adapt automatically to your level of experience? When they can't even do the most obvious things properly? What? No, I don't buy it for a second. This, maybe noble, intention may only bring more chaos and pain down users heads Ì†æÌ¥∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Historically, data entry and data validation are only loosely coupled - from the days of dumb 3270 terminals to web browser forms prior to client-side Javascript: forms get validated server-side only after the user hits SEND.

 @hiiamboris , do you believe (not feel) you provided any reason NOT to provide Single Feild Entry (I've named it, SFE)?

Our goal is to help humans (I know, that part sucks), without compromising security.
I believe I've addressed each case (Credit Card, Name/Password, IP number)

In other words, 'I don't like it' is not the same as 'this will make things worse vs better.'

@GiuseppeChillemi  great declaration, great question.

If you will allow me, let's pretend you are making a Calculator.
Simply put, start with just building your parser and calculator as a block box function that can be called from anything (API).  Use a state machine for your settings and system state.

So no talk of UI here (other than through a command line).

If you just did this alone, we have 98.6% compatibility between the world of Rebol/Red etc. and other interfaces, such as the Web.

The UI conversation is one that has to do with making a dedicated language and the shit show that is JavaScript and HTML work together, which is sadly pathetic.

 @hiiamboris 

[I hope this is fun for you, it is for me, just to confirm, I consider this a great way for people to work through an idea]

'(1) I don't think this unification improves anything,'

Indeed, this is your opinion.  I'm trying to get our opinions out of this conversation.  I'm attempting to objectively prove value, leverage, and advantage.

'it increases complexity by an order of magnitude for no reason'

This is what you need to prove.  Please remember, I don't care what the programmers have to do, I care what the users do.
Google Search is MILLIONS of lines of code for one input box.  Right?

'(3) lemmings‚Ñ¢ are gonna screw it badly (think 80% sites).'

I'm not sure what that meant. 

This diagram with examples demonstrates the user can do things as they do now, OR, my Single Entry Field makes things always BETTER.

https://www.figma.com/file/nimk1TBSYSFjOQyP1lPAJn/Misc.-Things?node-id=130%3A2

I put it upon you, or anyone of course, to prove specifically and directly it does not.

But let's stay away from opinion.  Put in mechanical terms, I want to fill in a Credit Card form old way, would need copy and paste 4 times, or if you like (from one's memory) typing, and then moving the cursors from the keyboard, or finger, or mouse 4 times.    SEF reduces this to 1 time.  

And then, has added benefit of dealing with some edge cases and correcting them for you.  So as swapping info into the correct fields for you if it can be deduced or even induced.

@planetsizecpu 

I'm not 100% sure I follow (I truly could be dense).  
I do know Email addresses have problematic edge cases for their formats.

However, this is why I believe such problems should be solved by calling on centralised (or decentralised if you think of this like DNS) parsing rules.
In other words, Let's say you have a website, and you want to parse an email, that is using a new top-level domain you have never seen before.
This should not be your problem as a programmer.  You should send the part after the @ to a site to tell you if it is REAL (per se), right?

You can do it locally (Javascript) to the level that you pulled all the info from some other site as well.  Shouldn't ICANN provide this.  IN FACT, shouldn't ICANN offer a DiaGrammer page to show the logic and proof of resolving emails?

This is one of my patents in fact https://patents.justia.com/patent/8386517

Translated back into actual English (trust me when I tell you I did not like the way that patent was written), the patent describes exactly the process of a system that tracks and shares the rules of confirming what data is, thus 54.67 could be temperature, money, etc.  But statistically, it might be deduced further from other data around it.  558-52-2418 is a SS#, but unlikely to be a telephone number.   etc.

Imagine a magical system that you can ask what it thinks a given data string is!
but wait, there's more, what if it would give you a unique ID for that data type?

Thus 555-1212 is a phone number in America, but does not proclaim where, it needs an Area Code.
Id = 1 = US Phone number for all states and territories.

213.555.1212 is also a phone number, in Los Angeles probably.  
Id = 1.1 = US Phone number with an area code.

See, we suddenly have a way to encode or decode data itself!

We can solve all problems, and made the 'experience of the user' better.  That is all I care about.

As a byproduct, once we get over the hill of 'increases complexity by an order of magnitude for no reason' as described (LOL), then things should get much easier for programmers.

 That all make sense?

* > But let's stay away from opinion. Put in mechanical terms, I want to fill in a Credit Card form old way, **would need copy and paste 4 times**, or if you like (from one's memory) typing, and then moving the cursors from the keyboard, or finger, or mouse 4 times. SEF reduces this to 1 time. 

Now we're talking. The most important detail I made in bold. So what you actually want is just a tiny bit smarter paste operation that would switch to the next field when it encounters a new-line char. And it will be just so much simpler than reshaping the internet quest! ;)
If I like typing however, I just hit Tab instead of Enter and nothing changes for me.
If I was filling so many forms that it would bother me I would have used AHK or some other automation tech. I think for the average internet user like me this question never arises, because there simply is *no time overhead*. I enter stuff once on a site and it's held there for years.

' So what you actually want'

What I actually want is a dozen other things, but yes, you gave one use case.

Here is my use case, which I have checked with hundreds of people:

Assumes:

1. Starting from just a cell phone.
2. Using Credit Card info.
3. People who do NOT want to store this info on LastPass, or some such (but rather in their own locked text notepad), nor do they want it in a browser.
4. They do have the number in a locked notepad that they can copy from.

Thus

1. They can select the entire single line.
2. Paste the entire line into the first field of the Credit Card Form.
3. DONE

Happiness.

I can provide dozens of use cases for real examples like this.
So again, SEF does not get in your way as a user, but makes life better for millions of people all day long.

I hadn't seen, or had forgotten, what3words. I immediately thought of [UTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system), though there's a [milgrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Grid_Reference_System) version as well (name pun as an ode to Stanley Milgard). What made me LOL was that they use completely random words. Seems they want to make it more human friendly, but is it really? Street names are sometimes historical, but now random words developers like here in the U.S.  Some places (Utah and Washington) use grid numbers, which locals can use effectively, but visitors not so much. Theoretically, if you're a grid loving engineer and you learn about the system, you should be able to find your way around the maze, but I don't know how many people do that. 

There are many ideas here.

Naming a location, in isolation, with random words, aims to solve the "this location is always called X.Y.Z" problem, and gives a short bit of text to tell you where it is. That makes it a precise, concise notation for waypointing, though it will look like gibberish.

Waypointing ties to how we find things via relative directions. You have to know where X is to get to Y from it, and from there Z. This assumes none of those points are moving. i.e. this is not [Dead Reckoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning), but...can we put these things together? I don't mean that `milgrd` + reckoning = `Mildred`, but that's fun too.

`Milgrd` gets more precise the more info you add to the coordinate. In practical use, a system could infer the major grid numbers, or pre-fill them from your location. So you give your friends just the next part, with as much precision as you want. The most precise is the cafe table you're sitting at. Social distancing makes this easy, so we should keep it. But maybe you're at a faire and you know you'll be wandering in a section of it. Now your local motion tracker can note `[+1E -2N +4E ...]`without talking to GPS (need elevation too), and your friend can see where you were, then the waypoints you meandered through, so they can dead reckon how to intercept you. Then people can annotate grid elements, like on a game map that uses A* path finding, and live data can be used to track traffic so you don't see just a red bang! noting a road is slow, but how it narrows to 2 lanes, and each lane is red/green/yellow. Then you crash because you were looking at your phone.

So the two strings need different levels of protection.

There is always a better (and safer) way to do things).  But still does not address the issues across systems.

Keep in mind, as far as I'm concerned, you should be able to PASTE into the first field even JSON, REBOL, CSVs, and it will do it's best to fill things in for you.
Since there is nothing we are doing here that is not already happening manually one field at a time by a human.

But making humans fil in fields all day long is DUMB.

[side note, I booked some flights in a few weeks.  I spent 20min studying and filling in data.

I did not know my companion's Global Travel number.  But when I forwarded the Itinerary over to them, they were able to use the Magic code the airline gave me for this flight to change it themselves.  SCARY!

Hey, given this crowd

I'm archiving 35 year old data (3.5" floppies) from Amiga to PC.
I have about 500 Floppies.  I have access to an Amiga 4000.  It has a disk drive that can read PC floppies.  It has  large HD, enough to hold all floppies probably
My current plan is to copy all the Amiga Floppis into the Amiga HD, giving each floppy a smart folder name (i.e. 'FirePower-Dev-ver563')

I already looked into ways to get the data out ofan Amiga onto a USB drive for example, and the overhead to make this is work (seems) sadly too much time and energy.  I'm not sure why no one just made a simple USB to Amiga Parallel port adapter (Amiga's Par was bi-directional, and super fast).

But my real question right now is, what is the FASTEST way to copy an entire desk into the HD?

Just 'copy' takes about 2 minutes.

That's a great idea @BaronRK, which then gives users an affordance to drill down into details, which may then decorate the icon. e.g. in a metrics dashboard, you connect `statd` to `graphite`, but want to aggregate N values or wait T (time) before pushing. That number becomes a decal, a time refinement becomes a clock decal, etc.

1994 Nov.

I was trying to get Trip Hawkins (founder of EA) to green light (with Dani's permission) me remaking M.U.L.E. as a dial up (Modem, and shortly to come Internet) game.

This animation was done by the great animator Eric Daniels (who I was in a meeting with just the other day).

Well, I think it depends on the project and the moment.

If we speak about Red, I did my last project just to learn the language
and it allowed me to better understand how the view system works, to take
profit of path access and his power to access data across as many objects
you need. That way you don't need to peek or poke at memory as in golden
age. 

If we speak about other langs and projects, I must say sometimes you learn
more about the business involved. For example while writing stocks mgmt apps
I did learn a lot on the data model, but less about the language used.

Something that is always present in real projects is that the customer always wants to save money, I also learned that Ì†ΩÌ∏Ç

Pop ups (also can be called Coach Marks):

2. On Web pages - Agreed.

Thus I want pop ups to be off on the side, and not modal!
If you are on a feature, and it is there to help you, it does not stop you.

On websites, like Newspapers that want you to buy a subscription, WTF don't they pop up on the right, leave them there, so that you are not angry, but convince me?

For example, you get to an article, and over there is their 'hey, give me some money please'
But as you read the article, be funny (sort of to Boris' point) and say 'I see you like that article, join us, and you can access even more' or 'Our journalists are starving, throw us a few dollars and buy them a burrito)

My thoughts on this is that there needs to be an API testing tool.

You use it to inspect, test, and document API calls.

For example Circle(x,y,r)

It then asks you for the number range for each.
Thus documenting it.

Simple.

I've been working on a concept to allow AutoAPI building.  Literally, a way that without even knowing what API calls do, you can still use them instantly.

The one that kills me is a drawing program I use. When you want to apply an effect, the dialog for it comes up CENTERED, right over the image you're editing. 

My favorite popup story is being called in to ask if I could remove some from a system. The original dev had a prompt when you deleted something from the DB.

> Please confirm that you want to delete XYZ. [Yes][No]

Yes.

> Are you sure? It will be gone forever.  [Yes][No]

Yes.

> Forever's a long time.  [Yes][No]

The problem is that the users had become so annoyed with this, that they immediately clicked `Yes` 3 times, without reading the first prompt to make sure they were deleting the right thing.

When I suggested adding an Undo feature for it, they say "No, just make it ask once." :^(

It is localized state, that the browser doesn't manage directly. Is that the distinction? It's like the whole "stateless" aspect of frameworks, or FP.  To get anything done we have to have state, it's just a matter of how it's managed.

As I stated before, the browser itself isn't stateless, but pages are. If you switch from one page to another, the only way to transfer state is through cookies, post/get data, etc. I'm speaking specifically of allowing variables/objects/etc to stay set when navigating between different pages without having to jump through hoops (writing files to the local drive, explicitly transferring data through post / get, etc.)

[19:08:50](#sli0zORHqoOL9hM03IULjtN3ccLqou6OjYTgORktjR4) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
To me that doesn't mean pages (a page) are stateless. e.g. JS vars, field contents, and the DOM itself are state. Having state is not the same as transferring state, but the premise of [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) is just that. If all you can do is read static content, then you could consider things as stateless and fully idempotent.

[19:14:46](#SQpczMFTwog75bOAqu1-oYKeiXSb6X4JDZxdtvQT9gU) <Respectech (Respectech)>:
The way I see it is something along the lines of `func` and `function`, but in the context of a page. When authoring a page, the author decides whether any defined words are part of the local (to the page) or global (to the browser) context. That way, a single author can have multiple pages interact with each other without jumping through hoops. Also, multiple authors can work with other pages to pull in state.

[19:19:23](#ldvq9NK2VNG9GKTpQYDNSZhHFa3t8wszdgVzk_6vZ4o) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
Got it. There are a number of ways it can be done. Most importantly, a page can't "go global" for security reasons, they need to be sandboxed. But pages should be able to talk to each other via IPC, and even set up secure channels and storage for doing so. 

[20:36:53](#oteQCl72eRtKFfvGC_4HYW0OOViib1dhnMFKXiNu9eY) <BaronRK (Reichart)>:
Stateful/Stateless are nebulous words ensured to cause arguments between even smart people trying to agree with each other sadly.

https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/stateful-vs-stateless

So anything I write next is not an argument, but a clarification of my opinions.

I wrote BOTH above because:

- Cookies ARE a state (IMO).  That is one of many tricks to transfer data between pages.

- I think (IMO) that sites should have certs to allow them to be part of other sites and treated as such.  This concept of every site is a silo seems silly to me (and an illusion anyway).  So 'for security they need to be sandboxed' is agreed in sentiment.  But if Prolific wants to allow you to access Googles API or save your files to AWS you can't stop us, so security is an illusion anyway.  Why not just allow us to Connect to AWS and let the user know this?

- Func/Function - Agreed!  So we should have shared Context, of we could just think of this as a shared storage.  That simple.  I badly want this.  I want every website to know I hate Time Roman Font, so unless they have a damned good reason to show me, DON'T.  THis is a perfect example of shared settings and if we work that out, we can work out almost everything (I'm a fan of REAL WORLD examples).



[21:05:25](#PG9xPlVnDv9bg8ofPXLCGDGC3NAabWd46sxf8vnu4Wk) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
In the context of a Red browser things can be very different. When I talk about sandboxes I'm thinking in terms of how processes on an OS are isolated from each other and a `secure` dialect that works in conjunction with capabilities (in the E lang sense, much like phone apps work). So your "page" can't poke its nose out into the browser context and sniff around *unless* you specifically give it rights to. It can't access the net unless you say it's OK. It can't access your file system outside its own area, get your contact info, or use all the CPU or memory.

This kind of granular control will be a real pain to manage, especially when you talk about services that are abstracted away from you. So we'll need ways to say "I trust this vendor (cert holder) and grant anything *they* give me the following privileges: ..." They, in turn, have granted rights to other services, libs, etc. and you should be able to see that as a tree and check off, like an installer with options, what you want to allow. Maybe some are required and others are optional and you lose functionality by turning turning them off. Eventually it will be like a EULA nobody reads. 

But this also opens up new avenues. Here's our free version, but you MUST allow ads. If you want to turn ads off, or other ways we monetize you as our product, we'll give you a BTC total at the end of the setup process.

Back then (15yrs ago) My model of an API was primitive (similar to how APIs are now today)

My model for what we are doing next will be awesome.
I want to build a wrapper for APIs that enable one to figure out what the back end is doing  WITHOUT documentation.

I will post a write up this year.

As a side note, funny to me, Docker for Windows is a 500MB download, and ~2.5GB installed. The goal of containers is to be smaller and faster, right? I guess if you're comparing to VMs you still win. There's also a great irony in how *small* many things are on NPM.

It's certainly interesting, and the big players are circling each other constantly; with the occasional lunge or thrust. AWS has eaten everybody's lunch for a long time, but at the end of the day they still need to run code, and code is written in languages. What happens when you deploy on AWS and every package being pulled in makes MS money? It's brilliant, if they can pull it off. 

Windows gets undercut by Linux and open source, then containers reduce Windows VM use even further. It looked like the king of dev tools and OSs got undermined, because how do you get underneath the infrastructure? You do it by realizing it's a big circle, and everything that's been virtualized was done so with software. The *really* brilliant thing is that by making AWS et al be the "last mile", they carry the heavy load. Running a package registry, by comparison, is a drop in the bucket.

I don't see how anything from that article kills JavaScript. If JavaScript dies, it's because despite being one of the three standard languages of the web, it is unable to serve the needs of its community. It just seems like an outlandish claim to me. If Microsoft starts charging for free software packages on those platforms, that would be the surest way to kill the platforms and cause users to migrate away. I don't think they really care anymore about being undercut by open source software. They just want to charge rent for the machines that run them, but with Amazon having such a huge first-mover advantage, it's the de facto standard. It's not hard for me to believe that they mainly see GitHub as a way to push developers toward Azure rather than AWS.

* I just had a conversation with hiiamboris about a browser named Slimjet. I think he is  exited about it. For me I use it all the time except on some pages who recognises the in-build ad blocker and keep on telling me to turn it off which I wo'nt :P. Even when turning it off in Slimjet some sites still detects it (have to contact Slimjet about that). Luckily this is not the case on youtube so if you like an ad free experience with youtube and many more sites go to https://www.slimjet.com and try it.

Slimjet is a chromim-based browser - so will be close to 100% compatible with Chrome for add-ons etc. Vivaldi and Opera are similar builds - all with their own additional useful feaures, and quirks.
If you add uBlock Origin (not any of the other uBlocks) to almost any browser  you get almost ad-free browing.
Then add Sponsor Block for Youtube and 90% of Youtube videos now magically skip the requests for you to like, share, comment, and subscribe).
Those two add-ons alone (for any brower - they work for Firefox too) make the web an almost sane place to browse. I've almost forgotten what an ad looks like.

Our russian corps are more proficient at abusing everyone with their ads. E.g. the most popular here mail services sites load ads first and the mailbox after that only if ads were loaded, and they use the same address mask to serve both useful content and the ads, and also the same div styles. Good luck blocking that :) I don't know of a blocker that succeeds there.

Hmmm, I was simply pointing out that we had discussed many similar concepts for how a language should work, and what it should allow you to do.  I'm all about data driven languages/systems).

In Carl's original demo of REBOL (then called LAVA) I recall he made a Recipe for some food.  It looked like a recipe too, but in fact contained just enough code to execute and convert English measure to Metric.

I've been complaining about the 'round trip' lacking in data since I delved into iCal protocol (which was really lacking).
It was treated as one way data ('here, take this info about a meeting') without regard for the fact that one will want to REPLY with more info ('I can attend') etc.

The key question is whether to do it at the user level, as you have, with `system/lexer/preload` or if a `unit!/quantity!` type makes sense as a lexical form.

@Oldes I don't think your attitude is right. I do remember panicking, when something new and cool appeared and I have always thought, that it is the end of the world. Carl once stated something like - concentrate upon your target and don't listen to the nay sayers, as it is never too late.

In fact, I find Carl's idea brilliant. I do remember the bold era of XML dominance, and how rudiculed attempts like JSON were. JSON is a great proof, that ppl actually are for the simplifications.

If you use something regularly, you become inured to the pain. Having only needed to touch it a few times, YAML has tripped me up with things that look the same, or seem so to me,  but aren't. It's the same for those coming *to* Red. Hard at first because it's different. What matters is long term pain, ease, and clear communication in data. 

There is something to be said for formats that impose structure. It does have benefits. But it also comes with a cost.

Before XML and JSON for config files, we had CSV and INI.

Regarding @greggirwin 's comment on structure being good sometimes, I've been programming advanced 3d objects in OpenSCAD for the past year or two, which I understand is akin to Haskell in how it imposes structure.

[21:21:36](#1pKTMZtrPBtauVgdYv6VmpwIpVxxdFIXw8dl7AiTqPU) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
What's interesting WRT syntax and punctuation is that we have necessarily force-fit things for our purposes. Punctuation helps structure prose and denote groups in natural language, but what we think of as data structures (key-val or table) are hacks to some extent and there is no real consensus.

I thought braces were a good choice in Rebol, because of the hand-written use of them for grouping lines of text. Using them for objects is still a grouping, so isn't an unreasonable choice. But replacing that with multiple single quotes for ML strings is a harder sell for me.

INI files are a great format (we should have a codec even though their largely out of fashion), and are like R2 VID; easy to use for many common cases, but also not hard to run up against their limits.

@greggirwin My one in Rebol.org needs some changes to run in Red (I have the Reddified version if anyone wants it).
Also, for flexibility, it breaks the INI standard  - if a keyword occurs multiple times, each line is collected in a block; otherwise it returns a string

* Have to add red to system path environment for this. I normally execute .red, .bat, .ri (stands for red include file which are inside my library folder),  .r,  .r3, .bas, .vbs,...etc. inside my editor (Geany) with the help of a path to a bat file which determine which command has to be executed. **This** is really complex. I can explain but this would take a lot of time. Just to show you how complex this is. Only the 'dispatcher'.
I needed this because at every new version of Geany I loose my build options. So I came up with this (not to show off btw):

After testing I place this code **before** Red [] between = (80x) and = (80x). This way I can add documentation and test code without it being compiled into the final program. Comments do take up space you know. Maybe you can use this too. And a program can include these .ri files.

Say you have a folder with contents: test.red notes.txt test.mp4 testing.png 
This bat file creates the following folders (if they do not exists already): .red .txt .mp4 .png and moves the files into the corresponding folder.

file-organizor.bat
```
@echo off
rem For each file in your folder
for %%a in (".\*") do (
	rem check if the file has an extension and if it is not our script
	if "%%~xa" NEQ "" if "%%~dpxa" NEQ "%~dpx0" (
		rem check if extension folder exists, if not  create it
		if not exist "%%~xa" mkdir "%%~xa"
		rem Move the files to the corresponding folder
		move "%%a" "%%~dpa%%~xa\"
	)
)
```

@Respectech  have replaced the battery, switched on the device, and updated and my main problem is still there: I have 5 access points in my company, all with the same SSID. Shelly has no way to select a specific one, a frequency or a max address, or select the strongest signal.  So you never know what it will be coupled during setup. This is a major drawback of a device like this which can be used in large areas.
Another problem was the sudden heavy drain of the battery when the device is distant. My hypothesis is that the device tries to connect to a distant access point when it activates and it fails so the connection hung or keeps failing forever. Se I have from 50% to 0% in 24h.  I will test it today. as I will upgrade one which used to fail and test if version 1.10.x has solved the problem.

After looking at the show notes, I can see that most of the content is based on this document: https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining/blob/master/topics/go/README.md

Our chat has been prophetical! After our talk, I have continued working into my company, where I have set up my Shelly devices up to 00:15 AM. Then I have switched off the office lights, closed the doors and moved home.  This morning I have connected to my PC via AnyDesk. When the screen has opened I have found something strange: the remote desktop was black with a browser window opened at its center and the site was my bank institute. I have not made any action on that computer! Also, there was a server error on it. I have closed this browser and realized a console with PROCMON was the window making the screen appear black. I have started to panic! What was happening? Was someone inside my machine? The answer came just after: another browser window was open, inside it I have found a bank transfer was stopped at the second authentication, that one connected to my phone device.  The one no man could pass without hacking my phone. Another quick view on the second monitor and my password manager was open, four password tabs open, and also Microsoft edge open and used. The heart was pumping loud with my body and mind full of adrenaline. I have closed the phone call with my secretary telling her "my blood has frozen, there is a problem, I will call you later". I have then thought at max speed what to do, which information could the hacker already have in his hands after having accessed all my passwords. I have thought that he could still have not changed the most important password: the one of the email account where I receive my confirmation email for password changes and the one of the passwords manager itself (that I have never written anywhere). I disconnected because that machine was unsafe, and tried to access those accounts via my local machine. The password manager was either not authenticating me and after a successful attempt, it has frozen multiple times! My hypothesis was the attacker could have changed the credentials and some sort of erratic state could be between the remote password manager state and the local one. Ok, I will try it later. With just the passwords in my local browser cache, the password manager was still able to let me log in to my email account. It could be a matter of time, seconds before the attacker could have changed the password,   so blocking me from everything and having full power to change the credentials.... heart was racing...

**[Hacked, 2/3]**
¬†*It could be a matter of time, seconds before the attacker could have changed the password, blocking me from everything and having full power to change the credentials.... heart was racing‚Ä¶*

I was able to login into my email account and I have changed its password. This was my greatest fear: the Hijack of the email I use to register on all sites. Being able to get its full control, I have felt a sense of safety. Now it was time to understand if the company site has been fully compromised or just my machine. I have checked for the antivirus but I have not found it installed and this was strange, I didn't remember having removed it. I have reinstalled Kaspersky and also, other tools to check for possible backdoors and suspicious activity.  Before leaving I have begun a deep scan.
 I have then move to my company location...

I have traveled 30 minutes depicting in my mind all the steps I would have to do. Sunlight was strong as in Sicily, the last 2 days were very hot days, spring is here in its full power and birds, butterflies and gnats are flying around, also flowers and trees were covered of colors! 
When I have reached our office, the second round of my work has begun: I have seated in front of my PC and I have started searching for other signs of activity on the security register of all of my servers. I have changed the remote access tool password, added a 2FA as OTP, and removed a couple of those RA tools used from our ERP seller. In the meantime, the antivirus deep scan has ended with few low threat warnings. Still no sign of activity, maybe the hacker will return later to complete the work. In the meantime, I was able to access the password manager GUI from my mobile, so my safety sensation was higher! Having done my best and needing this machine for some work I have set up a personal work policy for the day. After having taken other security measures in the remaining computers of the company, I have started using the compromised one. The policy was to never enter any password, no login to any site,  do only simple jobs where no data could be taken to perform further breaches or facilitate them.

**[Hacked, 3/3]**
The remaining part of the day has passed quickly. When has been time to leave I have closed the windows, turned off the lights with my monitor being the only thing emitting light in the dark. I have cleared all the servers' passwords and moved to my home. My intention was to let the target machine available to the hacker while being able to access the whole site and this machine remotely.  At 22:30, when a thief could suppose nobody was in the office, I have connected remotely and... *surprise!!!* All the windows were open again. With my heart racing, I have realized there was a remote RDP session open. Maybe I have forgotten it or the hacker has had access to it. Windows were still opening, the task manager was in front of everything, and there were mouse activity on the taskbar. I have caught him! Here is the video of the hacker in action: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-upP2wlCWQ5qNUIuiE_4k9zOzSWTEArF/view?usp=sharing on the bottom you can sport a circle that corresponds to his mouse clicks.

The circles, their slow-moving, strange clicks patterns like small sudden jumpings, too many windows open, circles instead of mouse pointers, the sunny days, insects everywhere, the PC screen being the only source of light in the room and I have realized what was happening! Some butterfly or gnat was jumping on the touch screen! And it was opening applications and windows randomly, including the task manager! Oh my God, everything is now clear: some bug should have clicked on the monitor for the whole previous night! The most incredible thing is that the insect was able to open Procmon, a console, Chrome, retrieve my last bank session that could have been minimized and not closed, initiating it, and stopping at 2FA! Also, it has opened EDGE (I have never used it) changing its configuration to tabs minimized above the address bar as miniatures, and also activating the last password manager window. Of all the possible windows/programs combinations the destiny, incarnated under the tiny pawns of the gnat, has chosen to let me find open the only one capable of triggering a big hacker alert, Including starting a bank transfer on the most hacked institute in my country. Before leaving with this incredible story, I have had to look at only one piece of information capable of confirming this is what has really happened: the last login record of my account on the bank portal (I have not opened it before because I was on the compromised machine). It reported 3 days ago and not yesterday. Horray! Now can relax and sleep.

* **[Hacked, 2/3]**
¬†*It could be a matter of time, seconds before the attacker could have changed the password, blocking me from everything and having full power to change the credentials.... heart was racing‚Ä¶*

I was able to login into my email account and I have changed its password. This was my greatest fear: the hijack of the email I use to register on all sites. Being able to get its full control, I have felt a sense of safety. Now it was time to understand if the company site has been fully compromised or just my machine. I have checked for the antivirus but I have not found it installed and this was strange, I didn't remember having removed it. I have reinstalled Kaspersky and also, other tools to check for possible backdoors and suspicious activity.  Before leaving I have begun a deep scan.
 I have then move to my company location...

I have traveled 30 minutes depicting in my mind all the steps I would have to do. Sunlight was strong as in Sicily, the last 2 days were very hot days, spring is here in its full power and birds, butterflies and gnats are flying around, also flowers and trees were covered of colors! 
When I have reached our office, the second round of my work has begun: I have seated in front of my PC and I have started searching for other signs of activity on the security register of all of my servers. I have changed the remote access tool password, added a 2FA as OTP, and removed a couple of those RA tools used from our ERP seller. In the meantime, the antivirus deep scan has ended with few low threat warnings. Still no sign of activity, maybe the hacker will return later to complete the work. In the meantime, I was able to access the password manager GUI from my mobile, so my safety sensation was higher! Having done my best and needing this machine for some work I have set up a personal work policy for the day. After having taken other security measures in the remaining computers of the company, I have started using the compromised one.

Not directly related to Red or REBOL, but strangely motivating to read stuff like this:

https://stationhq.com/blog/a-new-era-for-station

Station was an application, built on Electron to group common webapps and make them searchable. Using Electron turned out to cause so many bugs and so much resource hogging, that the developer simply gave up.

Imagine if common webapps were built in Red/REBOL and Station was a Red/REBOL application. It would have consumed 1/100th the resources, while being able to perform the same tasks.

I'm still greatly in favor of having Red/REBOL in a browser form factor, one that people understand. I think that could make Red popular if it directly attacked the web application space.

@henrikmk skimmed. It's funny, a common criticism is that we shouldn't reinvent the wheel, but use solutions that already exist, created by experts. The problem is that they often solve only vaguely the same problem when it comes to anything beyond strictly codified algorithms (which are the easiest thing to port). Once you have more than one moving part and compromise in that vein, and none of the other solutions know or care about each other, you end up with a hodge-podge and no conceptual integrity. *But* you can still say you architechted and designed it. :^)

There are MANY parallels between building houses and software (more than between building hardware and building software in my opinion, which is what most would think).

I'm always fascinated though in building houses (which I do often as my own hobby) how many custom parts are needed, and there is no way around it.  How many standards there are, and how things that look similar are in fact not.

Consider just pipe fittings.  There are a dozen isles filled with what is basically the same almost identical shapes, but firstly made of different materials.  Schedule 40 PVC pipe is a great example, because they are so identical you can even fit most of it to each other from Electrical Schedule 40 (more expensive, and gray) to Water Schedule 40 (usually white, sometimes purple, etc.).  But, they are in fact not the same, and while one can use electrical for water, the other way around is very much not advised (although, technically it would be mostly fine for the record).  Due to wall thickness, UV protection, etc.

Should we make it such that it can be used for either?  

https://www.commercial-industrial-supply.com/resource-center/difference-between-plumbing-pvc-and-electrical-pvc/

Same for Metal pipes for water and gas.  Again, they look the same, but the fittings are slightly different.

I view file formats this way.  There are reasons and advantages to having data stored in formats specific to what you are doing.  One size does not fit all.  XML sucks/ed for storing 3D information (VRML).  I'm not even happy about HTML for that matter.  

Rebol blocks are still much nicer than JSON, can do everything JSON does, and also be executed (and easier to type).

We all want one size fits all,  simpler, etc.  But the right tool for the right job is important, and it takes a lot of engineering to make one tool that does many things.  

My favourite physical tool that only came into existence in recent years is the https://www.allfasteners.com.au/news-articles/the-unlikely-origins-of-the-oscillating-multi-tool

It changes how easily and fast I can do many things, and I use it about 30% of the time for most problems.  I want more like it in fact.  And have made my own bits for it to make it do even more things.

It exchanged brute force (giant blades cutting) for simply vibration.  It could still be 10x better with a few more tricks (blower, vacuum, light, and gigs).

Some will recall the Roty's, and the hodge podge of poor design and implementation put into the first few years.

Red deserves a cli and gui vote window, on a block chain.  Formalized a little with a Chamber or Formal discussion channel.

Conceptually a purposeful meeting at a table, with a chairperson and delegated Mr. Speaker control of the floor (like a Parliment, following Robert's Rules of Order, but looser for internets).

Clearly it needed to happen.  The format sucks, it is just another copy of everything else out there of course.
'If you want to make an apple pie from scratch...'  should be the slogan of every software company.

But, that all aside...

One small thing they do that I appreciate is they 'try' to scan your posts before you post them and help you make them better.  Something I've been doing in Prolific almost since day one.

I wish Gitter did.  For example 'I see you are posting about a new language, would you like to move this conversation to a thread dedicated to this?'

That, would be awesome.

NextDoor noticed I mentioned gov agencies, names of business, rude language (it got it wrong, I was LITERALLY talking about 'crap' as in sewers LOL).

Some notes from the guy mentioning Zig to me ( he knows of REBOL and RED, which was nice)

{Yeah, that's exactly right: the "honeymoon phase" of every project is
the fun part. The Zig folks are very pragmatic, though, and they're not
afraid to put nose to grindstone and do the "sucky parts". I've been
really impressed.}

{I probably will end up doing some Go at some point just to try it out. I
expect it to be excellent for creating Web-based backends.

I also use some command-line untilities that are written in Go, and
they've been really good.  Same with Rust.

Zig attracted me as being capable of 100% replacing C in ways that
neither Go nor Rust can, like embedded development. I really enjoy
low-level programming as a hobby, but every language I've learned has
gotten me just 95% of the way there. (I could never force myself to just
go ahead and go all-in on a project in C because it's so painfully hard
to write correct C - there is so much undefined behavior and implicit
behavior.)

I've jumped from language to language so many times that's really been
quite wasteful. A great learning experience each time, yes, but not
productive. I want to settle down with a language with NO BARRIERs,
learn the crap out of it, and then just build stuff. :-)}

Side note, he wrote an ICS filter I used online to Lint an .ics and I reported some bugs to him in his code.  He was really appreciative, and I explained some stuff we had learned about .ics files to him, so we've just been talking.  His dream when he was a teen was to have an Amiga.  Sadly, he was stuck with Radio Shack Ì†ΩÌ∏ü

Awe.

I'd call that progress.
And the edge case could be fixed by having a way to interrupt scripts run from the GUI console. With Rebol, you do not have to terminate the console after this code - thanks to an effective ESC key:
```

A friend of mine literally searches for photos for books, they do not have anything useful (they have also done work for Pearson, same.

But, why can we just upload that to Flickr, and then, just click or drop simple outlines on things, and name them, tag them, link them?
Even to other photos.

Outline the red shoes the dapper man in front is wearing, link them to the shoe's site?  Size and all?

Simple.  I though Flickr was going to do this.

The web container article overloaded my hype filter. :^) The future is bright, according to them, because things are faster, and you can run node.js in the browser...which already runs JS. I get that it's meant to solve certain pain points, but adding yet more into the browser doesn't seem like a great way to go about that. The link to the [NPM worm exploit](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/319816) was new to me. Certainly, I keep learning a lot that we need to consider for Red, so I appreciate the link.

[6:58:20](#rd6VeleoF4xRGb7ittZuxNYDwaMhKawnxhsVW4NQt84) <zentrog>:
Yeah, it's a little bit hard for me to wrap my head around, as I'm not a web developer, so I'm not very familiar with these tech stacks... But it does seem interesting using the browser as a security sandbox for your dev environment. That worm exploit sounds pretty alarming, and if it ever happened, it would cause a lot of havoc. I'd almost be more worried about subtler, more targeted attacks designed to insinuate themselves into dev/build systems though, like the FireEye attack.

We are building our new UI for Prolific (formally Qtask).

I decided to scrap that and we have moved to Flutter.
WAY WAY WAY better
We are back to 'Write once, test many' at least.
And we can produce Apps for iOS and Android to go into the store.

WTF is inside that 50MB?  

I truly do not understand either.  We are researching.
There are odd little things missing in Flutter.
Like it has its own render (for SVG like things) but does not support drop shadows.
Small, subtle, but REALLY important for lots of things.
We hope to fix, and submit to Open Source.

We will post a link to our work soon (this coming month).

Exactly the questions I hope to address.  As you know, we get into religion when programmers pick their tools.
Personally, my religion only includes Programmer pain, time, and money.
But for some it is all about philosophy, pedantics, first principles, etc.

Everything is easier in Flutter, even with less support and being early in its life.
It is more the WAY we think and do things to start.

But, the fun here is Will and I started with React, I spent good money to build a living app, and then, threw it away because I can't argue, Flutter is better.
We will write up answers with real examples during and after the first mini-conf.

I'm still working out what I want to do in that.  It will be a mixture of what we are working on, why we are working on it, and what we are learning as we work on it.
I have a LOT of info I want to present.   But I want to keep the core event to 1h (it will be recorded)

We did a little mini-conf a while ago just to outline things (Nenad even joined) .  For me, I consider such a thing a success if no one hates any of the ideas being presented LOL.  We did well.

Math error: near SQUARE-ROOT (a / b)
```
Than:
```
Math error: cannot divide 45.973464664 by 0
```
The second message is completely ACCURATE. But the first is way more HELPFUL in finding an errant line of code in several thousand.

(Of course it‚Äôd be more helpful still if it did mention the divide by zero; and the line number in a named script file; etc.  But it still gives me a better shot at finding the problem than the accurate message).

Red is a full stack language, but it sometimes seems that the stack has been loaded into a black hole ‚Äì there are very few built-in tools to debug code.  My rough guess is that makes Red (as it currently stands) about 25% more expensive in developer time when debugging.

Which is a pity ‚Äì quality debugging tools are a killer app in many successful languages.

If the Red development team have usage cases in their business plan, I would hope that one of the cases is a maintenance programmer in ten years time. That person should be able to debug an ancient, legacy, Red application with ease because the debug tools are worldclass. Let‚Äôs not be PERL :)

Certainly interesting. Part of my own Funcology idea (I considered FuncUniversity, but FuncU...) is based on pattern matching, but also a corpus. So it's really more of a search and learn tool. e.g. find funcs that take two strings (`user` and `host`) and return an email address from them, or all funcs that take a `block!` and a `function!` as args to find HOFs. If the results are part of a package system, people can rate them, comment, etc. It's similar in ways, such as being able to use keywords that match  in doc strings or func names.

Copy and paste coding is often derided, but it can be effective. This just automates it a bit, for those who copy other's code and not just their own.

CoPilot will open questions, and they have a lot of disclaimers in their FAQ. It has the same problem as Red/Pro will face, in that it's a service and people need to trust the company with their code. For us, the obvious way around that is an on-prem version, but if it's closed source, as a commercial product, they still have to trust you.

In terms of value, we see the power of DSLs. Their power comes from being specific and knowing about a domain. CoPilot talks about using context, but only for a single file (so far). The interesting question for me is: What makes human programmers effective, and how do we learn? As @hiiamboris notes, it can generate boilerplate faster than a human. Autocomplete, in contrast, is concerned only with the insertion point; a single, very specific context in an expression. If the value comes from leveraging knowledge of data structures and common operations, this is perhaps the opposite of a low-code tool, where you can tweak the boilerplate, but everything is included by default.

For us, perhaps it's about the models, frameworks, and dialects we use to describe a system, from which most of the behavior (given common application needs) can be derived. I've written plenty of code generators in my time that did basically that for CRUD-oriented LOB systems.

@gltewalt:matrix.org that is suitable (and desirable) only in a language that fully compiles the code and where every single code branch is type-checked by the compiler, so instead of possible runtime errors you will have to write code to handle *every* error until it compiles. Thus enforcing correctness at the expense of development speed, which is a good thing, but totally not possible in Red, and is too high-level for R/S.

I started a Wiki last month, and began just shoving 'agenda topics' into it.

It became very clear instantly there are 5 major silos of topics I want to do mini-conf for (1 hour tops: format: 20min declare problem, 20min discuss solutions/future, 20min Q&A, a proven smart pattern)

Will (my co-architect) and I met yesterday in fact regarding Flutter.    To be clear, 100% of our Flutter mini-conf is to just help others.  Sharing what we have learned, why we picked it, what our plans are, etc.  Let people ask us about things.

Roughly the silos are:

- API -¬†What is the future of API?
- Flutter -¬†Why Flutter over other frameworks?
- DB Truth -¬†- A different way to think about DataBases
- Quilt 3 - Currently a full-stack = Front end and Back end.¬† There might be something much better.
- Blue Machine - The new tool on the block - Flowcharts for Project management and¬†Programmers

I will post Agendas once they are reasonably worthy (soon, like weeks not months)

The V Programming language transpiles the code into C first.  Their default C Compiler is an Open Source Tiny C Compiler TCC it is a very fast compiling cross platform C compiler.  Since as I understand it the only parts compiled in a Red Compiled program is the System Code and the rest is still interpreted.  So I was thinking that if the new 64 bit Red compiler started off with transpiling the Red System code to C and embedded the Red interpreter in a 64 bit TCC C program along with the transpiled C code from the System routines. It could then copy the Red source into the .exe as a resource and the compiled program could then  execute the Red code as interpreted code until it can to a call to a Red System call and then the interpreter would do a callback to the compiled System function.   If that would be doable then it would seem to me to limit the amount of new code that would need to be rewritten.

@GaryMiller, Carl as alluded to things going pretty quickly, but he's a deep expert in C, hand-coded it, and Rebol is only interpreted. As a project we have our objectives and, while 64-bit is *very* important, it's still less important than other things. Our core team won't be pulled to write a C transpiler, but if someone else wants to R&D that, we will support their efforts, because we learn from every project and having people work on things they're interested in is what makes them the most productive. Just as @alanVF's red.js work isn't official, we're *very* excited to see it being done.

I can type over 100 words per minute on a mechanical keyboard with few or no errors, because of the tactile feedback. On a standard modern (non-mechanical) keyboard, I can't type quite as fast and I make more errors because I'm not 100% positive that every keypress was registered.

I had a DAS Keyboard until recently, which are (or were) supposedly renowned for their mechanical keyboards. It worked ok, until the A, B and D keys started having some kind of delayed registration of a keypress, causing characters to be swapped or come in doubles. It looked to me to be a keyboard controller problem, rather than directly with the keys. There seemed to be nothing wrong mechanically with the keyboard. Nevertheless, that little thing made the keyboard insanely slow to type on, since I had to do far more corrections than usual.

I then bought an Indian RAPOO keyboard for 1/5th the price of the DAS Keyboard, and it's better than the DAS Keyboard.

I don't know if there is a point to that story, maybe except that good keyboards need to earn their reputation over years and years of abuse. Being mechanical, being made of steel and having the crisp keyboard click sound isn't enough.

Keyboard choice is deeply subjective. Objectively failure rates only matter in the aggregate. My MS Natural Keyboards have had two problems historically. 1) the `SDCV` keys lose their lettering (same keys, 3 different keyboards, which I can only attribute to a heavy left hand for S and D, and extra use for C and V (copy/paste)), 2) the space bar became harder to push on one. It was a pain to try and fix and ultimately had to be scrapped. I keep buying them since their shape is what helped my hands most.

There are many ways to build games. Because they generally don't use native controls, you have more work to do. I suggest looking at @hiiamboris' [Red-Spaces](https://gitlab.com/hiiamboris/red-spaces) project. It's still very experimental, but may give you a good starting point, rather than doing everything from scratch with `base` faces, or using images and hit testing as I believe @planetsizecpu does.

As one that has made a lot of video games, I'm going to step in here.

It is interesting to be thinking of doing 'hit testing' (let's call this collision detection) from a graphic (or worse HTML) point of view.

This is not a VID VIEW issue, this is pure clean simple maths.

And your first check is just to see if anything is in the viewport to be rendered in the first place.  After that, it is down to the most primitive/simple calculation you can make.

i.e. if (distance < circle1.radius + circle2.radius) {touch, yay!}

In 2D, it is rare there is more than a dozen things actually moving around.
And any given object only needs to do a simple test to check for collisions with the background.

But images you see on the screen don't need to have anything to do with the physics model for collision.  And, you can mix and match models to get the most speed and accuracy.

Also, you can add them together.  So you do a single quick check (radius) to see if you even want to do a deeper check (down to the pixel or intersecting vector lines) if need be.

Ok, looking for advice.

What is the best File Management tool out there?

But I want to be specific, what I'm looking for is a tool that looks at your folders, drives, etc. and get all your stuff down to just one clean copy.

In other words:

Imagine you have a bunch of external drives.
There are lots of redundant copies of stuff.
Everything though is random.  

What you want at the end of the day is one drive with one unique copy of everything.

Yup, we are talking about NOT losing any data.

Hence, actually, the whole model of file shares is wrong.  The way it should work is files (data) are stored in raw form, and then the metadata is stored separate than that but pointing to the data, and then there can be many different views of this (tags or hierarchical).

Hmmm, I wonder what system does that already? :)

But, if we MUST live in this shitty system we currently have in the wild, then...

- Give me the chance to make that decision.

In general, one is going to take some folder, and move it to the Destination.

After that, each folder or file that is moved should be checked against the Destination, and offer you the chance to decide what to do about it.

@baronrk, but we don't really want it *only* in one place, because we also need redundancy for safety. Today you might want to keep a local external copy, but also a cloud backup (or two).

I have old backup drives, and folder names by machine, that have migrated over time to newer, larger stores. I thought a USB SSD on my router would be a great solution, but not everything could work with it the same. So there are still technical hurdles, and since this is a "long view" need, it *really* needs to depend on as little as possible.

Jose, exactly!

Our system Prolific does this.  AND, it does not waste space of what I call 'random dups'

Meaning, we take each file, and make sure FIRST we have one real copy of it.  

THEN, for each one of those, we make a known (not random) duplication to multiple back ups.

We must not confuse the two.   That is how errors happen.



[18:34:33](#1aRMr6puvfVDPLk5WhG3oDwmkqWs-KhTcYG27DRc6pU) <BaronRK (Reichart)>:
Gregg - right!  

And I want to address that as well, but it is at least covered by the concept that if there is a single system that checks for dups, I can at least rest knowing the device I have can be freed up to be used for gathering more data.

Sustainability is our goal. Until you reach a critical mass, it's fantastically difficult. That's why the vast majority of "products" in this space fail. That said, we don't *need* to reach millions. Pros and cons as your user base grows. We need X customers times Y dollars divided by team salaries - minus cost of developing stuff that doesn't pay. It's not a huge number by any means, but still large enough that it rarely works out.

Another possible approach is to find a patron, as [Cognitext did with NuBank](https://cognitect.com/blog/2020/07/23/Cognitect-Joins-Nubank). For that to happen, we need to grow and have value in their eyes. If Clojure didn't run on Java, they *may* have turned out to be just another Lisp. Go and Rust came at it from the inside. But you still have to sell it to your employer and keep selling them. e.g., Dart is still alive, but lives deep in Go's shadow now. If not for Flutter, my guess is that it would have been retired.

That brings us to the third leg of the stool: a killer app. Spin the wheel, roll the dice, say a prayer. You can't force or predict them.

So commercial products are the plan. We have 2 openings and can justify a third if the fit is right. Paying in crypto is also a blessing and a curse, but that's where we are right now (for the most part).

What do they mean by "variety"? How files are grouped and how big they are? OK, but what does that tell you? Can you really find things faster this way when you give up some *very* important features, like sorted lists and a canonical layout. Relative sizes also have pros and cons. e.g. I can't even get a hover for many things in https://octo-repo-visualization.vercel.app/?repo=open-policy-agent%2Fopa.

I thought it seemed like an interesting way to get a feel for the general layout of an unfamiliar repository. In a way, it is sorting (hard-coded by size), since we are so good at visually comparing quantities. But I agree, file size is somewhat limited.

It really just pushes problems around. It doesn't solve them. And while we may consider it, or others may do it, it doesn't fit with the idea of reducing complexity overall. We also have to ask *why* C is still dominant, what it was designed for, and what it's used for.

Ah, I see, thanks. This raises an important question. Note that we've moved to D2D, and will move to SSE. These are modern, fundamental elements in Windows and CPUs respectively. Flutter, however, is likely to come and go like other transient technologies. So the better way to integrate with it (and Flutter is on our radar, make no mistake, as is Material Design) is for someone to champion it, and then let us know when something is needed in Red to facilitate interop. We can't afford to follow too many trends, but have to choose them carefully, regarding what will help Red succeed.

Glancing at Flutter I found https://flutter.dev/docs/perf/app-size, which has a treemap view for app contents, which aligns with what @zentrog:matrix.org was talking about recently. Cool idea. It makes me wonder if there's a way to blend the ideas of 2D/viz and sorted columnar data that leverages both. Some researcher must have done that somewhere. Navigating a new world/project/system is *hard*.  A single view may not be enough, but the ability to switch between 2 or 3 of them that are each tailored for a specific mode of learning the landscape.

@BaronRK might have thoughts, based on his knowledge of dead reckoning, and @toomasv or @GalenIvanov might be interested in how pathing through diagrams or simulation explorations apply to this. For example, if we have a universal system navigator, could it apply to file systems, code cross references, data structures, and distributed systems? If we track and collect the paths people take, what can we learn from that? Can we draw a diagram that highlights paths others have taken (shortcuts)? "I see you're coming from S, here are paths others have taken from there, and those that spent time at a destination (meaning they found what they wanted, rather than backtracking and going somewhere else) ended up at Z."  Sort of like a Recently Used list, but showing the connections.

Or maybe a search feature where, like Everything or grep, your file view narrows things down, but a treemap would highlight the boxes where a result occurs, maybe with a badge for the number of occurrences.

You're hitting on the core issue, one view of data is so 2020.

For example, what is the difference between a report, and dashboard, and therefore, UI itself?

What is the difference between Search, and Filter?

There are differences, but should there be?

Why can't reports be Printer TO Calendars? 

Assuming temporal data, or even not.  A real example is if you have a list of tasks, no exact dates or even times.  Still, it can be displayed on a calendar in terms of assigning each task 1h, and filling the calendar 8 hours a day.   This is useful.

TreeMaps rock over pie charts in many places.  Even for a calendar.  Seeing your days as equal is silly.  For example Sun might be very thin.  That would tell you way more.

I think what @rebolek meant is to transpile from R/S to C, rather than generating C from Red. Transpiling is a somewhat modern term for tranlating/compiling to a language that is roughly the same abstraction level. e.g. from Typescript to Javascript. Since R/S and C are both low level system languages, translating from one to the other is generally much easier than a high level to low level compiler.

We may see a lot of interesting changes come about quickly. What happens when newborns can be vaxxed, and both hospitals and insurers make it a required part of the maternity care process? Will more people have home births? What if we find that C-section babies are more vulnerable, as with a number of other aspect, where going through the birth canal "immunizes" them because of what they're exposed to. Will  we see less C-sections and scheduled births? Will CRISPR be widely approved if it can address COVID/SARS, and open the door for more use in other areas? As we start tinkering like that, what unintended consequences will come about? Interesting times, to be sure.

Simple odd question:

What is an example of a programming language that is NOT Turing complete?

[20:22:22](#HfC_u8hlsakoOJCRI7Ri5q-48IfDT78jQTnGhbRhGEg) <BaronRK (Reichart)>:
Yes!

In general, MOST devies need an IoT interface fro a few simple things.

Other examples:

- I have many vacuum robots (Chinese ones are better than iRobot FTR), and I have one that tells me the bin is dirt, but not that it was cleaned.  Little things like that are important in group situations.
- Also, in general, you want different messages going to different people.  Pool pump runs each day, but pool pump error should be forwarded to pool guy.  etc.

[20:46:58](#caj7kd1mUi-QyMx9vK99FLwb_bjceOktyhmWeDhngAs) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
I just want a refrigerator light that dims up when the room is dark, or always. Don't even need IoT for that. If the new LED lights are standardized enough (appliances love their special parts, hence 273 types of fridge water filters), we could build it into the bulb itself. If a capacitor is used, it would also dim down when the door is closed.

The general appliance IoT issue could probably be incredibly simple, though I don't know enough to say for sure now that machines are doing more with chips and less with exposed wires and relays you could tap into. Having heavy smarts in these machines makes no sense, when all you need is short range transmission and simple messages. Then market the "House Minder" that listens to everything and acts as a proxy/broker.

I concur with @BaronRK . However, I would be extremely surprised if it had any benefit. I find that due to a person's foundational worldview and related confirmation bias, those chit-chat2 style discussions are rarely productive and most often divisive. There are a sparse few who are willing to look past their assumptions of what is true about reality and discuss with an open mind the merits and folly of any of those ideas. But those few are drowned out by the cacophony of the far more common parrots, the poseurs, and the intellectually lazy or incompetents. And don't even mention the trolls.

@gltewalt Fun list. :+1:

also: Perhaps the most clever piece of Redbol code ever. @giesse came up with it, but outside a few cases I think it makes code much harder to understand.

alter: Came up in R2 times, and needs to be addressed (https://github.com/red/red/issues/3190). We should address this before more time passes.

as: Strictly for special case optimizations, though I've thought about how it could be extended to do more. Another word I've used in the past is `cast` to mold one type into another.

decode-url: we don't have the obvious use case in Red yet, but it existed in Rebol. Given a URL you can decode it into a spec, which you can then easily alter for use with ports. The question comes up about why `url!` values don't just have accessors. It's because URLs are not fully parse according to their RFC. For efficiency's sake, they are only lexed enough to classify them by the characters they can contain.

ellipsize-at: Think of how often you see "read more" or "see more". This is part of `help` today, but I think it's more generally useful than that.

exists-thru? and read-thru: All `*-thru` funcs came from the Rebol idea of a basic, user-controlled cache. It existed mainly for use with the Rebol desktop, which is another tool we don't have yet. `thru` needs some thinking, because Rebol only had one, and Red uses `system/options` for it today. That means it's shared "per system" (not per OS setup), so different sets of Red apps can each have their own cache. That's great, but also means a module and package system will be duplicated, and that's where caching could be the most useful.

extract: I was surprised how much I used this in R2. I have old mezzanines, which we also want to consider in the HOF space, for extracting by name. e.g. you have objects or keyed blocks and want `index` to be a name rather than an offset. This also ties somewhat to reflection, which is always a [fun discussion](https://github.com/red/REP/issues/68).

flip-exe-flag: This is fun because of the body. Talk about magic numbers. :^)

help-string: I'm anxious to see how we extend reflective ideas as we write more tools.

immediate?: Same as for all other type queries, but typesets are one of the things about Red that *almost* aligns with how OOP people think. How I think of typesets in Red is very different than OOP interfaces or inheritance. Much more how we group things as humans.

scan: A great example of how important helper funcs can be. It's a good name that makes the intent clear. I wonder if the doc string needs fixing. It says "guessed type" but it should be "recognized type" if `/fast` isn't used.

swap: Related to `swap` and `move`, I have old `shift` and `rotate` funcs, which operate on series, which were very handy in some cases. For `rotate` you can do it now with `move` to be more efficient than `take+insert` . e.g.

```
rotate: function [
	"Rotate values in a series."
	series [series!]
	/left   "Rotate left (default)"
	/right  "Rotate right"
	/part
		count [number!] "Rotate this many positions"
][
	if empty? series [return series]
	; modulo the count against the series size
	count: any [all [count  count // length? series] 1]
	;if zero? count [return series]	; MOVE handles a zero /part correctly
	head either right [
		move/part (skip tail series negate count) series count
	][
		move/part series tail series count
	]
]
```

I haven't rewritten `shift`, but now that Red has a native one for bitsets, it will be more work to do in R/S.

transcode: Controlled loading. So much power.


I will add `unless` to your list as well. When we start collecting more than reference docs and basic examples (as red-by-example does, falling under ref's IMO), we'll have a lot of rich language discussions.

Their summary about what it is:
```
Htmx extends and generalizes the core idea of HTML as a hypertext, opening up many more possibilities directly within the language:

- Now any element, not just anchors and forms, can issue an HTTP request
- Now any event, not just clicks or form submissions, can trigger requests
- Now any HTTP verb, not just GET and POST, can be used
- Now any element, not just the entire window, can be the target for update by the request
```

@gltewalt:matrix.org "worth it" for what? 

It's been around since 2014, and has ~5K stars on github (about the same as Red, coincidentally). 

A key point they make is that the "calls" will likely return HTML, not JSON, so it's not really about APIs in the normal sense. In the sense that functions are like APIs, then yes, it's about triggering a request and getting a result, with that result being applied implicitly. That is, rather than getting data as a result and then doing something with it, the result immediately gets "merged" into the global state (the DOM).

What I'm missing is where the *rest* of the state comes from. If all the information for the call is based on the HTML element attributes, how do you send data. Yes, it adds options for making HTML server requests, but they don't say *why* or *when* to use it. They do note HATEOAS as the foundational model, so my take is that it is "more event triggers" and declarative application of the result. That may have a lot of value for web devs. I can't say. But it strikes me as another case of pushing something (HTML and links) into an area it wasn't designed for. But I can also see cases for it. They don't have full examples that I see, but I can think of at least one specific model of UI where it might help. 

Seems designed to work well with the author's other project: https://hyperscript.org/

I really, really don't want to have a web front-end for my back-office software, but I also need the interface to run on many different platforms, from tablets to phones to desktops (primarily Windows and Linux) to SBCs. Red isn't at the point to offer this in the near future, from what I can tell, so we're going to have to move forward with a web front-end on our rewrite. Our back-office software was developed in 2003 in R2/View and has gone through a number of revisions, with the latest major revision coming in 2014. I've been putting off the rewrite for a few years while giving Red a chance to mature more, but we can't put it off any longer. At this point, not rewriting it is costing us every day in lost productivity. That's the long way around to saying that tools such as htmx and hyperscript may be useful in our project.

* @Respectech I am stopped pn my projects too, because Grid View, DB, and Connectivity are a very high priority to me. While Ports are coming and I can use SQL Server with Munge, Grid View is a major issue. But as I want to be a man of  solution and not a man of complaints, I can say the following:
1) I can replace Android Tablet with Windows one, I have already purchased many second hand Dell Venue. Red GUI is fully working and can do most of the work.
2) I can use SQL Server with ODBC, yes, it is not open source but you can purchase a full working old version for few bucks and use Munge and ODBC. Then we could wait for MySQL: @rebolek is keeping a secret which is now no more a secret because you are leaving and it is an emergency situation: he has already made some experiments. He has a great experience as he has created Redis interface and his secure Red server has good progress. Also Ports will be released in december/january.
3) Grid view: last year nothing was created but now @hiiamboris has a made a great work with RedSpaces, a project created to develop Red native styles using Draw. Also a Pinky demo thas shows a [draw based Grid](https://gitter.im/red/red/code?at=61815440ee6c260cf7562a4c)
So, it is not 2019 anymore, we are in 2021 and 65% of work has been done, we miss the remaining 35%. 
I think the experience of creating new back-office software for your company, could give Red a boost towards the completion of those parts.

I think Red, represented here by @greggirwin will keep great attention to this situation as the needings of companies like yours are the winds a software company should ride to reach top levels.

@Respectech  I have stopped my projects too because Grid View, DB, and Connectivity are a very high priority to me. While Ports are coming and I can use SQL Server with Munge, Grid View is a major issue. But as I want to be a man of solution and not a man of complaints, I can say the following:
1) I can replace Android Tablet with Windows one, I have already purchased many second hand Dell Venue. Red GUI is fully working and can do most of the work.
2) I can use SQL Server with ODBC, yes, it is not open source but you can purchase a full working old version for few bucks and use Munge and ODBC. Then we could wait for MySQL: @rebolek is keeping a secret which is now no more a secret because you are leaving and it is an emergency situation: he has already made some experiments with a conncter for this DB engine. He has a great experience as he has created Redis interface and his secure Red server has good progress. Also Ports will be released in december/january.
3) Grid view: last year nothing was created but now @hiiamboris has a made a great work with RedSpaces, a project created to develop Red native styles using Draw. Also a Pinky demo thas shows a draw based Grid
So, it is not 2019 anymore, we are in 2021 and 65% of work has been done, we miss the remaining 35%.

I'm sorry if I sounded like I was abandoning Red. That is not the case. I just have to find a different front-end as I cannot require all my employees to carry Windows tablets around with them. However, they all already have Android phones with them at all times.

I already have a solution for Red and MySQL: That is, to use R3 as the MySQL intermediary and communicate with Red. I was going to have a MySQL intermediary anyway as I wanted robust logging and custom clustering capabilities.

What I am missing at this point is the ability to compile Red with GUI for different OSes on different architectures, which is why I believe a browser is perhaps the only good solution. A recent implementation of our back-office software was done in 2014 using R3 as the server side and browser as the front-end, so it isn't much different than that.

I remember Carl once telling me something like - why ppl did not swith to R3 already, it is internally so much better than R2. My answer was easy - ppl wanted their DB schemes, shell acces, easy library access, nice console, etc. So in fast, R3 was far from being on-par with R2 and provided ppl with little incentive to switch over.

I can see similar scheme with Red, and no, it is not a complaint, just an observatin. We can see ppl here or ther asking for 64 bit, IO and grid-view. Accelerated GUI might be nice, but if ppl are missing a grid view to display a columnar data, then it might be problematic to most. Remember - only a skilled person can write a grid-view, but it could be used by many. And yes, I can imagine (well, maybe I even can't), how hard work it might be to get to 64 bit.

So - I think above 3 priorities might not be far from top3 community wishes. Pity it does not seem to align with the Red Team priorities, or so it seems without me actually having access to any Red Team internals. Once again - it is an observation, not a complaint.

@Respectech, @GiuseppeChillemi I wonder, if SQL servery like MS SQL, mySQL have a command line tool too? I do remember one of the R2 SQLite drivers, called something like "a poor man's driver", which basically called a sqlite.exe and parsed out the result using `call`. I think, while not being ideal, it still could kind of work. Because, and in my opinion - the exchange interface is not going to be a bottleneck. Most of the heavy lifting is going to be done on SQL server side anyway.

* @pekr agreed, esp grid view.

I can't believe we are all talking about widgets still (30+ years)

It is clear what all the small widgets are (radio, checkbox, etc.) and yet these are still amorphous, and still missing things:

- Still want a standard Rotate button (like Amiga).  This is even more useful with mobile touch interfaces.  I want to tap, and go to next option all the time all over the place.

- 2D menus, why are vertical single lists inside small windows that require scroll bars even legal?  

- Filter list - no LIST should ever be presented without a filter (search even) at the top.  Gmail still does not offer this when selecting a Label, you are forced to scroll down through hundreds of words.  INSANE.

Moving up to a higher level:

- Grid view, or simley a dynamic Table: columns that can be sorted, grabbed vertically or horizontally, exported to CSV, printed, by default.

- List to List boxes

- File management 

etc.

We all use the same stuff over and over again, and yet everyone has to roll their own. INSANE.

@planetsizecpu my two plans in this direction are:

1) Keeping the FLWOR model in mind when designing HOFs and the markup codec. C# calls it LINQ (Language Integrated Query). I don't see it being standard, but an optional module. 

2) A simple native record manager. Not a full blown DB, but the core of one. Just the data, indexes for speed, and a small and simple ISAM-like API. I have done some tinkering on this. This is something that could be optional, but I think it's worth making standard. One reason being that we can create APIs that work either against local or remote datastores, as well as syncing entire datasets or subsets of them.

I also think there is value in having a dead simple SQLite option for those who want it.

[19:12:12](#KIiHImgBm8r6SoifkNR-6RuWYEM2gE7T0NN9lQmzSe4) <BaronRK (Reichart)>:
This gets to the heart of it:

- One might ink of a DBs scheme and usage pattern as a goal.  NEVER CONFUSE GOALS AND TASKS.
- When you start, there are lots of changes.  But the system lets you do that.  EASY TO PROTOTYPE,
- Over time things calm down, and the system helps you by reworking how things are stored, building key index lists, etc.  IT CONSTANTLY FIXES ITSELF.
-   

[19:22:06](#5K8AsSNGYo7WF0XX_5lzQBumDXeXlj_VJtO5FZi0z5Y) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
By being able to hook functions, back to instrumentation here, you can add higher level tools that track calls (HOFs and aggregates used here), notice what fields are queried or iterated over the most, and dynamically modify the rules so new indexes are added.

Schemas can be supported at a higher level as well. There are always tradeoffs. We can use blocks/maps/objects as the store elements, and do everything dynamically. It's less efficient, but is *great* for simplicity and data longevity.

Difficult to explain, when I know about OpenWRT just from screenshots. For me, it is a complete ecosystem. I can upgrade devices from ROS 2.x to the newest 6.x. All devices, including switches, use one system. Winbox console, mobile management apps, scriptable, you can see each packet going thru rules, so you actually know, if it works, or not. But also - MT is behind in wi-fi area, no wi-fi6 support yet, etc. I can configure home device the same way as a corporate CCR router, which we use for the 700+ of our wi-fi clients.

OTOH some ppl find the Winbox interface being complicated. So for the home users, there are Tenda, Dlink, Tplink cheapo devices, easy settable as a mesh. Some ppl prefer Ubiquiti radios, because nice apple like management interface. Depends upon what you really need.

PiMiga........................... LOL

What I want (literally right now) is a 'simple' way to plug a thumbdrive into an existing Amiga and treat it like a harddrive. 

By 'Simple' I mean: just plug it into an existing port.  Best would be the D23 Drive port, so it just thinks it is a big drive.  Thus, in theory, no software needed.

The PAR port on the Amiga was bidrectional, and could do impressive speed if I recall. 

It is strange to me this is not a common device.

It also speaks to the failure of standards to solve this long standing problem.
We need a way that survives into the future.
Epson did this with their printers.
There is (was?) a MODE you can ask of an Espson that is basically: Take this DUMP of B&W data and shove it into your internal buffer and print it.
You just needed to know the Width and Height as I recall.
This meant you did NOT need an actual print driver to print to the Epson.
Just send raw data out to the PAR (or SER) port and it would just do the expected thing with it.
That is the closest I recall of any real world example of solving such a problem.

[16:32:55](#v0VXRnksAUOcXqGIw88j1hOqgZlcaDpBN73QMZ5OCgA) <BaronRK (Reichart)>:
Accounting for humour:

Roku was founded by an Amiga Dev
Head of hardware and device interface was the co-creator of the Amiga, and graphics, disk-drive and more. Head of dev was a co-creator of the Amiga, and wrote the copper, and invented preemptive multitasking on personal computers.

Now, all that aside, the Roku is in fact a device designed to allow the very cheapest hardware to play back movies.    This is on par with saying, 'you can throw this 1kg bottle into that tree, right?  Now get it to the moon.'

They build hardware the runs in the few dollars, and still streams video real-time perfectly.

$1 = $4 in consumer pricing.  So by the time the device is installed in a TV, it can add $30 or more to a device, which can make or break it.  

The entire device line was designed to almost INSTANTLY allow new protocols, and newer cheaper hardware to be used without having to re-engineer anything.  This alone should get them an award, which they would be the only  OS/Hardware org in the world with that award.

This also means if they build some dedicated device for hotels, for example, they can use cheaper hardware with less features, and save 3 or 4, which translates to $12 or $16, which translates hundreds or millions instantly by checking a box.

Remember, there are many markets, and those other markets often are a huge percentage of a companies revenue.

Android supports.................. Android.  
Apple supports.................Apple.Roku supports anything that comes along.

And, lastly,  

' Roku is for people too cheap to buy a smart tv.'

In the US, you see images of places like Miami, glitzy, wealthy people, etc.  But in fact, they hold almost 25% poverty.  Really think about this.  25% of the people in one of the most glamourous (not to me, but yeah, people think this of the place) are in fact barely able to make ends meet.

A TV with a Roku that is focused on Spanish speaking people might lose some features they know they don't care about, and along with all the other cuts, run $100 less than any TV you or might buy in a big box store.

That is a massive difference in price.

[FTR - I have also made over 800% on my Roku investments. As have my friends that I share my portfolios with]

I like Smalltalk, although I only scratched the surface of Pharo. Yes, keyword messages are verbose, but informative :)
It's not only the language but the entire system that matters - System Browser,  Playground, Spotter, Finder and so on. 
I keep a printout of the Pharo CheatSheet  on my desk to remind me that I need to dig into it.

Pure OO programming mean mandatory working with objects. I'd rather prefer more flexible programming, because sometimes the object paradigm is not suitable, if you use it then you have to solve two problems, the one that the work poses and the one of adapting it to the objects paradigm. That's one of the reasons I like Red, you can choose.

Happy end of 2021 to all of you (and good riddance)
Looking forward to MMXXII

[total side story.  I'm sure many here that speak multiple languages, or interact with more than one culture, can relate.  

When we had a brick and mortar, we had a Pun of the Day award.  To acquire this award (have it on your desk, since it could be won by someone else later) you had to use a pun in such a way that someone noticed it, and also, someone did NOT notice it.  This cut down on the number of puns, and, improved the quality of them.    I've always enjoyed this concept of duality.  As I lived in many places, including UK, US, AU, and NZ, I've always enjoyed the rare times when I can say something in English that hold no meaning to one person, but a great deal of meaning to another.  And so it was, that one day on a hike in the US one of our group invited their professor to join us.  They wanted us to meet.  He turned out to be of the pompous Cambridge genus,  and so, accordingly, I would pepper my replies to him with subtle British colloquialisms and turns of phrase that all who heard me would not register for what it was, as I also would say it in a tone not matched to it's usual usage, but that he heard loud and clear.  Yes, I was being an ahole.  But he started it (the British always start it).  At the very end, as we were all leaving, and people were saying their goodbyes, I added my goodbyes, with smiles, and waves, 'and good riddance' - to which the look on his face was quite priceless.  He did not return for future hikes.  Hey, we all need hobbies]

```
The key is an integer from 1 to 25.

This cipher rotates (either towards left or right) the letters of the alphabet (A to Z).

The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A).
So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC".

```
But that doesn't tell me much, does it? What exactly failed in that mess of expressions?

Turns out I can answer that:
```

        find a s/1                  => true                                 
              s                     => "x"                                  
            x: % s/1 32             => #"^X"                                
          k                         => -25

*** Math Error: math or number overflow
*** Where: +
*** Stack: buggy-caesar 
```
Okay! Now I see that `(x: s/1 % 32)` is `#"^"X`:
```
>> to 1 #"^X"
== 24
```
And I'm adding `k = -25` to it, which overflows it before we reach `+ 25` part. So what if I put `+ 25` before `+ k`?
```

Someone else once said

> 640K should be enough for anyone.

Well, I don't know if he really said it, but I do remember him saying at a conference (this was the early 90s) was "I have 256M of RAM in my computer at work, but nothing can use it all." I think that's what we'll see in the future too. 

For Red, and for hardware, I think it means more disparity and more types of systems. Imagine a "1 bit" IoT device. Just sensors that "set" it to an on/off state that can be accessed. 8-bit devices that do something similar, but the 8 bits are interpreted as 0-100% (using the last 27 for metadata). 32-bits is far more than enough for swarms of very capable agents. 

Old systems sometimes had things like 11-bit words. The point being that things can be "right sized" as needed. If the smallest thing you can represent is 256 bits, every 1-bit value wastes 255 of them, and that's at the native level. HLLs, and things like Red datatypes will "waste" much more. (lots of quotes, I know) So we can get value *from* them, but pay in a different way. We are still deeply aware of bitness when we write code. Someone always has to be, but picture a day where you write some code, lay out metadata that says how much data it needs to handle and, given examples, how fast it has to process it. Fire up the constraint solver compiler, and it gives you a list of hardware options and their tradeoffs. From there, you select the target, it builds for that (ordering the hardware if it's an embedded system), and the fully automated system burns the chips and runs the tests you spec'd.

Thanks @loziniak. The license bits jumped out at me most, but Go being tied tightly to git I had forgotten about. Simplicity comes at a cost. 

On licenses, a key aspect for me is that GPL protects the software being used, but doesn't (I'm happy to be corrected) stop people from using it in any way, commercially, even without disclosure that they are doing so. In that sense, it's not much different than more permissive licenses in practical use.

The cynic in me asks: Has free software "won"? Has it raised awareness and motivated people to make conscious decisions about how it's used? No. Not by a long shot. Those building it are still at the bottom of the totem pole, in all respects.

@gltewalt:matrix.org it depends. I notice two things generally:
- When my mind feels like it's going to blow. This happens only on the most complex design work. This is physiological: brain has consumed too much blood oxygen and needs "recharge". To restore it, any motoric activity is great. General health state and diet can affect it.
- When I'm exhausted with some boring task. Like beating at some bug for hours. This is psychosomatic: induced by the emotional state. A walk helps, but generally if you can learn to watch and affect your state you can counter it. Simplest example may be to turn on some music (if you're receptive to it): if it feels like you're crushing bugs from an Imperial Death Star, it changes everything :)

But as [The Proclaimers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrHaAIbUG0o) say so eloquently, I might not be there yet. ;^) At the same time, do my good deeds commit me to a life of do-goodery? I don't want to be either the redeemed or the fallen, whose final act defines them. Just hoping for a decent batting average.

@dsunanda I think we do have distinguish between drawing graphics as a demo, and building GUI apps. Can Red do what that demo does? You bet. See the tiger SVG demo at about 1:30 in [the original Android teaser](https://www.red-lang.org/2018/04/sneak-peek-at-red-on-android.html). Our Android branch is out of date, and some things have to be synced with VID. e.g. there's no native `switch` style on desltop OSs.

One of the brilliant things that it looks like Processing *may* do (but hard to tell from demos), and I know that Delphi does for sure, is having a simple menu option to build and sync to a mobile device. It needs to be that easy. It's doable though. Probably 5 years ago I did a Red demo at a conference, where I cross compiled to Win/DOS/Nix/Mac OSs from Windows from a simple script. So once Android is in place, it's just `call red -c -t Android` and sync it.

Ummmm, No. That tells you nothing about actual use. I've searched for a lot of lang info which is not an indication of me actually *using* those languages. I imagine a lot of people search for trendy langs, but still have to use old ones at their day job. We do have to account for influencers and such, but we also have to ask what aspect of "popularity" is important, especially in the context of Red, rather than keeping our resumes looking fresh.

Even tools like https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2021/4 can't paint a complete picture, though it would be interesting to take all the major language indexes and see how they compare.

I doubt it's possible, and certainly wouldn't be easy, to collect global stats on language use, installed code in production, changes over time, etc. It's not a technical problem, not entirely anyway, but a people problem. That's what *I* care about though. What languages are used most now, have had the longest life and biggest impact, and provided the most value. That's what we want Red to achieve.

@rebolek Today Oto and I tried to make Red work over docker. I think he tried to compile Red, not just download binary. That was one source of the problems I think. To me this docker image worked: https://hub.docker.com/r/kskarthik/redlang on Ubuntu. But to him it produced this weird error: "Syntax Error: invalid value at "^@^@^@^@^@..."  https://github.com/otobrglez/compression-puzzle/pull/16#issuecomment-1027911509 ... before that he also had some error that could be related to fish shell (vs. bash).

In the desperate attempt to save the company of my family, I have created 2 apps using WIX online store  "branded app" feature. The WIX engine is able to output the APPS for Google Play and also for the Apple store, in a modular way. It assembles, adds, and personalizes the code from a common base, then it builds and creates the APPs and publishes them. During this journey, I have thought a lot about Red, the experiments I have made using code segments taken from a library, binding and assembling them. I think that RED is well suited for such kinds of jobs, and would be the perfect tool for any company needing modular output. You have just to pick the needed code segments, assemble them,  parametrize the contexts with values relevant to the target ambient and compile the APP. 
If you take a look to our site:
https://www.ravioldoro.it/
You will discover that many parts of it are replicated on the apps, like the product catalog, the members management:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.ravioldoro
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/raviol-doro/id1604601157
The app is customizable even from my phone. You can add/remove sections and customize them with a simple interface.

Another #Docker question. The first time you run Red on a system it compiles compression library, Red console ... which takes some time. Docker works in a way that every time you run it (like kskarthik/redlang) it runs like it's all a fresh install, so this compiling is going on every time. Is this compilation very system dependant or is it possible to recompile this once, take that linux binary and posti it somewhere, so docker script can download it and start with that? Docker has a way to pesist things, by mapping to external (host system) folders, but that complicates the docker script/setup and is usually more meant for data.

greggirwin (Gregg Irwin): BaronRK (Reichart) I don't quite understand what you mean by "ready to go", so I may be responding to the wrong aspect. In my experience, starting up a container is pretty quick ~1 sec or so. You do of course need a running linux host, and if the container image isn't already present, it will take time to download proportional to its size (that part may or may not be cached). I think the main purpose of containers though is about packaging up an application along with its OS dependencies in a way that you don't need to worry about the configuration of the host OS where it runs. It also sandboxes it, and presents a consistent API for configuring and securing the application. I guess I would agree that it does push the problems around  more than it solves them, but it does standardize how the problems are solved, which can be leveraged a lot.

In my view, Red could work pretty well within the container ecosystem because it has the potential to make very capable microservices in a small size. And that means you can host more of them with lower hardware constraints, which equates to cost savings at scale.

One thing to keep in mind is that Docker is pretty low-level. It's like the interface between the application and OS. I spent a few weeks recently learning kubernetes, and it is insanely complex, though it's the kind of thing you need if you are building a globally scalable application. My analogy for it is like a distributed operating system.
If you want to do some learning, this video series is fantastic:

'ready to go'

I view everything in terms of key frames and deltas.
In C terms this would be Exe, Obj, then below that Source code.

If a Docker fires up, and needs to compile to update stuff each time, that could be slow.

If it can follow along and keep things updated, so the nEXT person can benefit from the resulting Obj or Exes, wonderful.

I'm a fan of the Docker concept.  I just don't know how hard it is to keep it fast on going.

That makes sense. A lot of that depends on how the container is made. For red, it‚Äôs not hard to have the console compilation already done. Some sorts of things are harder to do ahead of time though, and it‚Äôs also pretty easy to waste a lot of space. Harder to be lean and efficient, unfortunately.

> I simply don't understand why this is not 1h worth of work 20 years after we knew what was needed for the 'web'

Agreed @BaronRK . I've been talking with @toomasv about app templates and such. I sent him some old R2 code, one project being EasyList (one of many Easy* projects :^), which was a very simple engine that let you write an entire CRUD app like this:
```
do %easy-list-x01.r

spec: [
    List of albums
    Each album has
        title
        artist
        "catalog number"
        year
        "record label"
]

easy-list/open spec
```
Yes, it was incredibly crude, but still useful. Is there really no PowerBuilder, FoxPro, or Access for the web? Seems [PB](https://www.appeon.com/products/powerbuilder) is still around, but no Web version. Even searching for things in that space turns up an amazing lack of pertinent results.

I'm regularly seeing a weird bug in W10 file cache. Suppose I have a file with a hard link to it. Technically it's the same file. I'm editing it and saving in one place. Then `dir` in another place will still display the old size and modification time, until I *read* this file from it's another place. `git` gets tricked by this too and thinks that file hasn't changed.

* :) Well, we could image a situation in which every website has to advertize the client-side resources it needs (eg 100Meg storage, access to camera; admin read/write access to Windows folder etc).

And then client-side browser either refuses to download the website; or it crafts a tailored sandbox just for that website and what it claims to need.

Preach it brother!

Sunanda, I want (everything you said) regardless.

Ideally in fact, I want smart shared and private caches.  And alerts when something is fishy.

It would be super cool to say 'Twitter can use Spotify's music interface'

A couple quick guesses. 1) It's written in Pascal/Delphi/Lazarus. 2) It's not creating a data structure in memory, per se. It's scanning the file and marking data locations so they can be viewed on demand as you expand the items. It is a viewer only, and note that there's no `expand all` feature in the viewer, as that would be a massive amount of overhead for large files. 

This is not to take anything away from them. It's a clean tool and seems very nice. Exporting the data as XML was lightning fast. Finding text was also fast. It does what it says it does, and is optimized for this one purpose. $200 annual license. If you need what it does, it's probably worth it.

It took it .14s to load their 26M file. Red took 7.5s. 53x slower. Their RAM use was 36M, ours was 466M.

We can't spare any of the team to have fun experimenting on a fast structured data viewer, which could be done a few ways for comparison (`parse`, R/S, JSON fast lexer based on Red's), but if someone else wants to do that, we'll sponsor it.

That's what I thought, that they actually read a top structure, without a further expansion. We could do that with streamed parsing Doc envisioned probably. As for the speed, R/S is supposed to be slover than C, but Delphi was never a speed deamon either. As for the RAM, once again - streamed parsers might be a better fit in future.

@pekr, actually, Pascal and P-Code BASICs could be pretty fast, and Delphi can be very fast for certain things.

For this task we wouldn't even need stream parsing, but just using `parse` on data that large, e.g. `parse <26M-string> [some skip]`, may take a full second or more. But  R/S will scream through it. Then it's a matter of only using `parse` on small pieces, between markers, which will be instant to a user's eyes.

@rebolek makes the point clearly, which we also face in Red with `skip/offset?` vs `at/pick/index?`. One of the main reasons some devs prefer, and argue for, zero-based addressing is calculating offsets based on element sizes. This makes sense in lower level languages, and even some dialects perhaps (e.g. R/S), where you're mapping indexes to offsets, but it makes index accuracy suffer in the process.

Of note, I have a similar issue with Pixels.
A topic I brought up a lot 25 years ago (was some of my first conversations with Carl about how to build View for Lava (REBOL(Rebol))) :)

My point being that we should not use Pixels, but rather hint to vector how to keep things ordered in low res system.  (like font hinting)

Most people (artist or programmers) should not need to be thinking about this almost ever.  The tools should hide this from you unless there is a good reason for you to be messing with it.

Just like any Maths library.

I will add into this list of issues clockwise and counterclockwise issues with vector rendering.  This too causes bugs.  So Figma (popular design and layout tool) fails to save SVG images correctly about half the time.

You have to mess with it to not be off by one, meaning, sometimes you have to add an EXTRA vector point to fix it.

I watched this API video.

Warning, <rant>

I 'feel' like we have this HUGE problem, like a building method that keeps producing confusing building layouts, that eventually always falls down, because they are made like any house.

And houses sound great when described: a foundation, a floor, walls, roof, etc.

But actually, almost every house out there is built wrong.  For one thing, they are built bottom up.  And you CAN build houses that last a long time this way.  And perhaps even several stories tall.  But philosophically, it is still just sticks and mud, and very difficult to change things later.

About 100 years ago we sort of 'comprehended' a completely better way to make buildings.  Instead of bottom up, top down.

In fact, what you do is build a cage, and then 'hang' the walls from the cage.  This simple but subtle concept literally changed everything.

Now one could build 'spaces' that change all the time, even right now to the plumbing if you follow just a few rules.

Let me drill into this a little more (if you will permit me).  A few of you even in here have been to one or more of the houses I've built or redesigned, and know I make a really nice 'space.'  But, my next house I will build from scratch, using the techniques of skyscrapers. 

It means pushing the 'strength' to the corners, and all walls suddenly are no longer load-bearing, and can be moved and changed whenever you like.  Worth EVERY penny.

Let me take this even deeper to make a subtle point.  I helped a friend of mine fix his house in the bay area.  For the past 20 years he has left a single wall in the middle of his house UNFINISHED (much like his code, he is a leading researcher of AI at PARC).  As a gift, I finished it for him.  But he fought me at first.  He was caught up on using nails or screws., and what was legal.  Being a weekend warrior of sorts as he was, he drew bad conclusions from forums.  

It was a common pattern.  The 'old experts' would attack the young new contractors, and tell them all sorts of reasons something could not be done.  One was 'using screws on a shear wall'

And they would be right, if the screws were the ones from when they were young (the 70s), which were made of pure shit.  But today they make amazing screws just for shear walls.  His next point was that they said these were expensive.

He is right... if you were doing a whole house of them!  But not for one wall, where our conversation was costing more than the box of screws. 

I built him an earthquake shear wall that is so damned good it WILL be the only thing standing 100 years from now.

(side note, when I was done, I also mastered the style of the 60's stucco artist that did all his walls.  Literally practice for a day until I could reproduce exactly the way the original person did the house, and then proceeded to texture the space so well you would never know any work had ever been done.  And, someone in this group was my assistant on that :) so they got to see how I do this stuff)

Ok, now back to APIs.  The whole API concept is wrong!  But just like houses are wrong.  Sure, they are 'good enough' perhaps.  But it is no longer worth it to build that way ... stick and mud.

So his video was solving problems (from my POV) which are problems on top of other problems.

It is not 'instead of' per se (but indeed, it might appear that way.

Rather (and first) I consider ALL interfaces between any two computers to be an API (literally).

So, WebDAV, POP3, HTTP, FTP, blah blah blah.... these are all 'API's

In fact, WebDAV and IMAP really should be the EXACT same API.  

The question we should all ask is, 'why do we need to custom cut every 2x4?' (48x98 mm)

What percentage of every single house is using the exact same 'intended' parts?

(I say intended, because every single 2x4 will be 'slightly' different for each wall, custom cut, but the goal is to just have an exact size)

I view almost all of what any API as doing as falling into the following basic groups:

- ID (you, the account, a project, rights, SSO, etc.)
- List management
- Object management

So, why aren't all API calls basically just CRED (Security is implied)

Create( Event, In_Project, Template)
Read
Edit
Delete

If you don't know what fields to fill in for the template, you can ask for the template

Read( 'Event', In_Project, Template)

We need just one more simple trick to make all this really easy:

An agreed upon list of variable names

If my template had a variable for 'Name'

We can all agree a file has a Name.
A task or event on a cal has a Name (even if it is the summary of it.
A Wiki has a Name.
You have a Name.


The goal here is to find ways to treat all things the SAME.  Because most of the time, that is what we do.

Editing the name of things should be the same code regardless of the object.

Summed up, this is all about just setting up some basic rules, and protocols.

NOTHING here would stop you from doing custom crap (which is currently the default for everything).

Rather, it would mean copy and pasting code to do obvious things.

Incidentally, I doubled the size of our current house. All of the parts that I built, I built in the method you describe. There are zero load bearing interior walls, even in a complex polyhedron area of about 1200 sq. ft. with a complex roof structure above it.

I have noticed that many systems and procedures are still in place and enforced today because of some limitation of the past (either physical, material, or mental), and not because it is the best way to do it now.

While I never did change any interior walls before moving, my old house was post and beam. I like yurts too. On APIs, Bertrand Meyer, designer of the Eiffel language, makes this point in his book `Reusable Software`, where he talks about things in terms of Linnaean classification for data structures. e.g. in many langs, stack have `push/pop`, queues have `enqueue/dequeue`, etc., but all 1D data structures can use the same name for these operations. We know this in Red because of the `series!` datatype. You can still add more control when needed, but being able to use the same interface for many things means a lot less cognitive load.

I'll answer your question, but, permit me to tell you a quick story.

That morning, about 15 minutes after the first plane hit, I received a call from the top reporters at the Washington Post.  They wanted me to estimate the damage ASAP.

Why were they calling me?  Yeah, normally that might seem strange, but two things: 1. I was the original architect of the WashingtonPost.com (called DigitalInk at the time).
2. I do forensics on high profile cases (mostly lawsuits).

At that moment they were estimating tens of thousands.  The best I could come up with after taking into account how many stories, and how filled the building would be before noon was 5-10x less than the number they were CONVINCED of.

The Twin towers are 110 stories tall.  If they had been made the traditional way (which would have meant a mass of ............................... wood), it would have created the most amazing fire which would have been both burned far stronger, and far longer (keep in mind, as it stood, the fires burned for almost 3 months).

My 3-5x might be low in terms of the damage it would have done to the air, and surrounding buildings with a fire burning much bigger and stronger for months.

That all said, I have been involved helping several teams with stats both during and after the event.  I lost several friends, and dozens of people I worked within those buildings.

While on this topic, a quick subtle example of something - America stopped all research on Cell phones and cancer.  You might recall all the data came from Sweden and other Nordic countries.  Why did America stop?  The entire research team minus one were in the first building that morning.  I know that one also.

An interesting note regarding Reichart's preferred building style (and one of which I'm also fond). In Medieval Europe, buildings were primarily made using timberframe construction. This is similar to post-and-beam which is used in most extremely large buildings today, but it generally didn't use any metal fasteners as they were expensive and hard to make. The wood joinery was designed such that the forces acting on the building would tighten the joints instead of putting stress on them. Many of these buildings are still standing today. (Side note: @BaronRK I am in the beginning phases of designing a Medieval-style timberframe to go on some semi-remote mountain land we've owned in Montana for 30 years - hit me up if you're interested in collaborating.)

But then "modern" house building methods were developed after the Industrial Revolution. "Stick-frame" is relatively fast and inexpensive to build, but has a lower lifespan than timberframe, and is not as durable.

Modern concrete construction is a sham. Ever since rebar has been a requirement in concrete construction and mild steel has been used as rebar in concrete, many (or most of) these structures have a lifespan of well under 100 years. Concrete absorbs moisture, moisture rusts mild steel which then expands, causing the concrete to crack and fail. That's the main reason the condo in Florida collapsed recently, exacerbated by the salt air. There is no practical way to remediate a building built in this manner. Personally, I'm surprised that this building style hasn't been outlawed, or at least the major issues addressed. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-long-does-modern-concrete-building-last-amit-enterprises-housing

An interesting and extremely low-tech housing construction method I've studied for about 30 years, and that has stood the test of time for centuries is strawbale. When properly constructed and enveloped, strawbale construction is inexpensive, environmentally-friendly, quick, load-bearing (2 stories or less), durable, and energy efficient. It can also be combined with other methods such as timberframe or post-and-beam to create a hybrid solution.

And, a very different way of thinking of this:

I created a language called MIDAS (which made GOLD files of course).  This was close to 30 years ago. It sounds like a Baccronym, but funny enough, the purpose of the language was created first 'Machine Independent + Demo and Animation System' - That was the literal goal.  To get basic demos with animation up and running on many computers at the same time.

I worked backwards from the goals:

- Write once
- PCode output
- A few dozen commands is enough to do most things (thus all commands fit in 1 byte)
- Run on C64, Apple II, Amiga, Mac, PC, etc.

After running many tests, and discussing the architecture with a friend that wrote Lattice C, I realised that for the most part, a compiler comes down to very simple structure parsing, but ultimately you want to get all conditional loops down to DO and WHILE.  This is really important from the POV of getting things fast on 1Mhz computers.  

Since personally, I'm a crappy programmer with good tricks, I only really program in Machine Language (6502, Z80, 8086, 68000) and LISP.   So either very low, or very high.  

Unlike 'beautiful' languages, I did not care about all that.  I needed Program Flow, not a language that did everything.  In fact, for the most part I wanted this language to embody ANYTHING that COULD be expressed across machines.

A command like IMAGE() would display an image from a buffer, or point to the buffer, etc.
Thus, the code for that would have to be custom written on each platform.  
I promise you, your not going to write the same code for a C64 screen and a PC screen.
So... move up higher to just image() (like a library call), and then custom write it in ASM on each.

But, it proved to be magical!

After just a set of 20+ commands, we could write simple programs, that did complex things INSTANTLY on all these platforms.  

As far as basic structure we used C of course Do() {...} While() {...}

Lots of OnInput(Button1) etc.
Where Button1 could be a joystick, mouse, or spacebar, etc.

We had rather complex full (complete) programs that were 1K.
A print command would literally be 1 byte for the command, 1 byte worth of length (no need for EOF, but also built-in counter), so only 256 length strings of course.  But again, super simple. 

But now when demonstrating to publishers how fast we could get games up and running, think about what our demo looked like compared to everyone elses.

@pekr Pekr, in psichology these behaviours are know: you are blocked by something, then you make an announcement to you are going to take action, then this phase ends and you are again blocked.

Small note, I will toot my own horn here, I prefer Carls MakeDoc over MarkDown, but I prefer my own QML (Qtask Markup Language) over both them.

Proof:

=H1 Overview
=b this text would be bold =. but this text is not because I just turned bold off with that equal + .
Or you could have =i had this in italics, and this in =b bold =b. and then pick up in italics and then turn it off with -.

I can also confirm that @BaronRK thinks highly of you @rebolek. He and I have both failed to find something I wrote about working with him, so I'll have to think on it again, thanks to your spark. :^)

---

It's tricky because if you take anything he says seriously *to* you that is  *about* you, in a normal conversation, you may be offended. As he has said himself "People feel important when they're offended, and I try to make people feel important." So never take him seriously...except... Except when it's not just chat that may lead to insights and connections and sharing information (like here), but *real* one-on-one dialogue. (language and culture can get in the way too, for me, so I may only make matter worse here; he can clarify as needed)

Real dialogue with Reichart isn't warm and fuzzy feel-good let's-hug-and-talk-it-out. It's a disinterested (but NOT *uninterested*)  accounting of facts that, if considered objectively (no matter how personal in nature they may seem), lead to an inevitable semblance of agreement and understanding.

It ends up being fun, because interacting with him is different than doing so with almost anyone else. If it's not fun, you're doing it wrong. Once you "get it", which I admit I didn't for quite a while (we got along great from day one, but I didn't *get it* by a long stretch), it's very relaxing, because you *never* have to censor yourself, be on guard, worry about him getting upset, or being wrong. That doesn't mean you *aren't* wrong, and he'll tell you so, but that leads to learning so it's a win all around. You just have to not take anything personally...except...except when he's trying to help you as a person, like an AI that analyzes you and works as a feedback mechanism.

For example, if he says "Let's have a call.", I video call and say "Hey, nice to see you.", and he responds "You're being an asshole." It's not a personal attack, just him being efficient, saying it objectively, and setting a context for the conversation. He could say "I'd like to talk to you about how you're treating your team and community." but it sets a very different tone, seeming less important. Mind you, he's not going to use strong language like that unless I really am off the rails and he needs to get my attention about it because it's affecting other people. 

His goal is to fix problems. Make things better. I know this now. But maybe I fire back with "No *you're* an asshole, asshole!". Now that's a personal attack, and an emotional response. To which he might calmly say "I didn't say you *were* an asshole, I said you were *being* one. Do you want to know why?" One is something you can fix pretty easily, the other not so much. And it goes both ways. If I tell him he's being an A-hole (I have to be really fired up to use the whole word), he'll lightheartedly say "What? Again? @#$%!" then seriously ask for the facts and issue any necessary apologies. *Real* A-holes never apologize.

Reichart isn't an asshole (objective use here, so the whole word is OK). It's an easy mistake to make, though, since he may look like one if you don't realize his face is just all puckered up because dealing with the rest of us is so painful for him. :^)*

* The smiley is there for everyone *except* Reichart.

- A bookmark/favorites feature, per channel but with a merged view of all as well.
- Search that gives you more control so the results are useful.
- I like the Telegram feature of having categorized lists of special content available. For example, there's no separate file sharing feature, they just go in chat, but then you have a group on the right with `[n photos n videos n files n links ...]` and can click on that to see all the files that have been shared in a channel. But because it's *only*  per channel, you have to know where to start looking. Normally that's OK for me, but it could have a Files view that gave you an explorer view, where files posted to channels are links.

Prolific is fine. FB can't say, never used. Twitter clearly an actor in browser wars and it will only show some "you won't get further!" page since a year ago. They have some advanced detection, not tricked even by client string spoofing. Discord works like shit, kills the battery. Element works only the archive version 1.7.26-1.7.28. But it is loading messages at 1-2 per second pace. Later they rewrote it, removed a lot of features and made incompatible. Slack was an early browser wars agent, put a lot of effort to ban the alternatives circa 3 years ago.

Finding a technical solution, that brings literate programming to wide use is a great goal. In the case of `help`, the historical goal has been "keep it short, because it's for console use and the content is in the code itself." There's no reason it can't be done with new approaches, but a fundamental issue has been the use of plain text files that don't require special tooling. That's great for many reasons, but limiting. What I hope we can do is find organizational systems for content (code, docs, tests, training, and more) that let us tie together long-lived content (e.g. plain text), with tools that make the whole richer. It sounds easy, and really shouldn't be that hard. 

It ties into other projects in my sphere, a big one being something I call `funcology`, and things like my dict-doc experiment.

@gltewalt we have to think about how a tool like DictDoc plays into an IDE that handles files and editing.

@GiuseppeChillemi depending on the editor you use, it's possible that you could use `call` with the new file name and it would open it.

It's a good note for @toomasv, as he's done a basic notepad, and we should support extensions and use cases like this....

I do not want to open another file tab, I need to load te selected one in the current pane/area without any prompt.

@BaronRK Btw, matrix integration is currently a valuable feature. Because by dividing and conquering we're not making the world any better for anyone. Well, maybe more a political feature atm than practical (until we make or see a good native matrix client). Unless you aim this chat system to be closed and tightly controlled ofc.

Here's also an idea one fellow shared to me: AI moderation. Is this user shitposting or is actually interesting to read for the others? It's more for open chat systems, where communities sprawl at random, than for work teams.

One word about defense too. In matrix it is currently possible to destroy about any room by sending a few millions of messages into it (will take days to sync them lol). Again, concern of open systems.

RE: New Roadmap. I'm a  little disapointed with red no longer compiling red code but I guess only for the cool factor and not a practical one: I would probably not see the speed difference....and there is always JIT down the road. I agree with some sentiment posted that  v0.7 with i/o is a good place to leave pre 1.0 and full stream to 1.0. That time line kills me though...but I guess its a lot of work to remove rebol from the tool chain.

I never said that. Stop misquoting me and spreading fake information, like recently "VID/S will replace VID".

@dockimbel,  When you have asked about each one priorities, I have put VID/S inside my preferred roadmap because I think we really system independent styles and I would like to see it adopted. The communication effect you have spotted is real: sometime, talking about the future, sometime people think something will happen, they infer it from the language even if no-one writes it. The good news is that as humans, we correct this effect like you have done.  The even better news is that you having personally corrected this effect, means you are back!

I'm also unsure if VID and VID/S can be unified. OS widgets are what they are. Inflexible. Modular VID seems like the way to go, while some conventions like `facet=` could be considered for unification.

@abdllhygt I'm looking forward to seeing you dictionary app! The choice of data structures is one of the most important questions in software development. 
Will your dictionary be two-way (for example Turkish -> English and English -> Turkish)? Most probably each word will have several possible translations in the target language - how will you seaparate them in an array (list, block)?
Many years ago I created a small program (in plain C) to help me practice the new English words I've been encountering. It has a simple CRUD functionality - to Create a word  (add an English word to my dictionary along with several Bulgarian words (phrases) with could be transleted to), Read a word (show the translations), Update (edit the word or update the translations) and Delete. The most useful feauture was the "Exam" mode, in which the program was testing my knowledge - it asked me to translate from English to Bulgarian or from Bulgarian to English, keeping track of the words I have  mistaken and showing them in the next sessions.
It was called Lexam (Lexical EXAM) :).
It took me many hours to code it and to tune the Windows messaging loop. I'm sure I can now write it in Red in a small fraction of that time.

Strange little question

I once heard a German use a word 'wasserkontakt' in a strange way, to mean 'you need to jiggle it to make it work.'

This is not what it normally means (it just means to contact with water).

Does anyone know (in any language) a word that carries this meaning.

Like when you have to jiggle the handle of a toilet to make it stop running.

It is such a wonderful concept, so to have a single word (in any language) would be so useful to have.

Well, the meaning of ‚ÄûWackelkontakt‚Äú is somewhat close to what you described, but it‚Äòs not so much an electric contact you need to wiggle/shake to make it work (which often helps, but provides no permanent solution).

It is interesting, but it seems like the arguments are mainly about what makes for the cleanest 'for' loop. When that's one of the bread-and-butter constructs, it makes sense that it's a pretty important concern for a language. But when going for expressiveness, for loops should be avoided wherever possible. That being said, I think slices could be a pretty interesting feature for Red, and I'm not sure how different indexing would affect that

I was looking for a slideshow app for Linux that would read all the files within a directory (including subdirectories) and play those files at random. Our family server has close to 100,000 pictures on it, so I also wanted it to start immediately and play the slideshow while loading the additional pictures, while taking into account the EXIF orientation data and creation date. I couldn't find anything, so I wrote one in R2/View (still not as comfortable with Red/View, plus I would have had to write the exif library binding as I don't think Red has one yet).

Now that I'm done with it, I thought I'd post it in Rebol.org, but I forgot my password and my email account that I created my Rebol.org account with is no longer in use. How do I reset my account on Rebol.org?

I've thought about doing this myself, but could also be done on a tablet-style device. My Mom has an Air Frame, so people can send her pictures via email, and she loves it. My use case was for photographers, who could offer it as a product/service along with hard-copy prints.

Unfortunately the same problem is in any market research.

If Red was used for something like this, it could be a very impressive alternative operating system for Linux phones, and I think could cause Red to become popular with a certain set of users. https://sxmo.org/

No one seems to get how POWERFUL a simple list COULD be.

Meaning: In this App for example, you can record, then pick up the recording, but then you have to pinch the loaf (that is an old ugly American phrase for take a shite and get off the pot).

Now, why................... can't we just continue the recording from the list view?  In fact for any item in the list.

Think how cool that would be.

You could have voice lists for different topics, Ideas, Groc, etc.

And on any one of them, just pick up where you left off.

Hello all, I'm thinking of taking an app I wrote in R2 and making it web-based. Its GUI relies on Henrik's amazing Vid-Extension-Kit's dataview tables and custom requesters.  The plan, until I can do this in red is to use Cheyenne's rsp. I'm looking for a frontend framework that can handle the tables. I'm somewhat partial to UIKit but honestly I haven't spent much time in this world outside of my own CSS and good old html. Any thoughts on what might be a good Vid-Ext replacement?

So there is a nasty core philosophical bug across OSs. (DOS)

Summed up: Linux (Mac) is case sensitive, and Windows is not.

So you can have a file called R.red and r.red on your Linux machine, but when you sync with Windows, what should Windows do here since it will see these as the same file?

My best solution is:

1. A Linux user uploads these two files to a repository
2. When a Windows person DL the two files,  one of the files will be renamed as 'r (1).red' (This is what Windows and Google Drive do by default).
3. If synced from Windows, then... the respository will now have 3 files: R.red, r.red, and r (1).red.

@riprwwa same as for case sensitive languages, it's faster and easier for machines to process, and means many more "slots" can be used (hence many more possible names for a given number of letters), at the expense of how humans think. Case insensitivity does mean you have to come up with different names, but if only the case is different, that doesn't tell you anything anyway. So it's good for computers, but bad UI IMO. They are good at things we are not.

> If synced from Windows, then... the respository will now have 3 files: R.red, r.red, and r (1).red.

This doesn't sound right @BaronRK. Windows can't have both %R.red and %r.red at the same time, so there will only be 2 files, or `[%r.red %r (1).red %r (2).red]`.

If you *have to* download the files, rather than *only* warning the user  and making them fix it first, it has to be some kind of convention. To @pekr's point, you can't know if the file is numbered because of case naming, or because it's a straight copy (or an historical one), which Windows also does. i.e. anytime there's a conflict. It often adds `copy` in the name, which helps there.

Has anyone added tooling to say files are exactly the same, N% the same, or add a metadata tag that a file was originally copied from another? AFAIK, only exact matches have been done, though some specialized software might do it.

All of this would be solved if the file system was my architecture which is a DB of hashed files (or even blocks) and the naming is tag based (not folder/file based) allowing for all possibilities.

I'm still missing something. 

My program needs to access `%r.txt`. How does my *code* do that without a unique name? There are scenarios where you don't care. What you care about is the content. e.g. SQL can query for you and returns sets of results. But there is also, *always* something that makes it unique, whether it's a key or a position in a list. File systems just put a human face on it. i.e. the names we see are already tags, mapped to internal inode and MFT entries.

So let's create a real scenario, and see how it plays out:

This assumes my system is in place.

A Linux person uploads R.txt and r.txt.
From their POV life is good.

Then, a Windows person that doesn't care about case DLs thse and what do they end up with?

That is a choice for them.
By default it would be r.txt and r(1).txt
But they could also ask to 'act like' Linux for a give folder, or an entire volume.

That way the exact same code can run on any platform.

But, Windows already does something 'similar' with type files that 'appear' to have the same name.

By default, Windows 8, 10,11, don't show extensions. So you can have two files R and R but in fact one is R.txt the other is R.mov.

But they do APPEAR to the user as the same name.  How is this any different that what I'm suggesting?
I'm hiding the Hash though.  

Ultimately Windows is wrong to ignore case.
All I'm saying is, they are welcome to keep pretending case does not matter in my system.
but there are going to be times when they need to pop up a requester to ask them how they want to handle something.
They can add that to the long list of stupid things they ask users because of their defaults.

I still don't understand why Notepad makes me save data, and worse, if I manually hit save, it MAKES me give it a name.

Apple built a whole company simply doing what MS does, but the opposite.

BaronRK (Reichart): It reminds me of the experience of every newer (and often even more experienced) programmer when they encounter a strange error message or stack trace, and it looks like total nonsense. They may even spend hours spinning their wheels trying to figure out where the problem is coming from, until they slow down and carefully read it to discover that it says exactly what the issue is (though usually in an overly technical way)

Nope. It could only run on any platform *using the new system* (back to XKCD on standards).

I disagree. It's simply a design choice.

And now...let's add *case preserving* to the mix.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/case-sensitivity (here is your answer to how your file sharing system could work @BaronRK, by forcing synced folders to use case sensitivity on Windows. Just be prepared for confused users and some software to mess up filenames.)

Does this new feature mean MS has seen the error of their ways? I don't think so. I think it means WSL and mixed-environment uses for devs and servers are important to fight Linux for market share and make it easy for them to use Windows with minimal risk.

For users, sure, and extra info is added to help, right? e.g. icons for associated programs by extension. But it's different for a program, which can't say `load %r` and not know which file it will get. The extension makes the names unique, and adds meaning. Here we *can* use tags in places of names, absolutely. All we have to do is say `load/options files/tagged [%r "text" [loadable Red]] ...` where `options` could be `require-unique` or `all`.

'It could only run on any platform using the new system (back to XKCD on standards).'

I'm already saying the solution is Windows has to be updated.  But so do all OSs.

'I disagree. It's simply a design choice.'

And I'll counter it is elitist to treat ASCII characters as 'the same' in all cases and cases (yes, both uses of the word).

A simple and real example:  Apple.txt the company, apple.txt the fruit.  It is a 'design choice' that causes other problems.

We have words for this: Capitonyms, Bicapitalization, InterCaps, etc.

But is also applies to words like eBay, or real names such  FitzGerald, McDonald, MacIntyre.  There is value in being able to write them both ways.

So, sure it was a 'choice' by MS, but it carries deeper implications.  Given it is 2022, I vote we make this about being 'WOKE' and if we were posting this all more publically I'm sure someone would make the argument that MS is being racist LOL

'Just be prepared for confused users and some software to mess up filenames.'

Right! We ALREADY have this problem, this is the point I'm making in the first place. And, if we already have this problem, let's fix it once and for all going forward.  My solution has been presented.  It does not make it worse than it is now, it solves that.  I'm offering the solve that solves MS, and the deeper issue as well.  

By doing it as I suggest, we don't add NEW problems, the problem is already there, I'm just solving the root of the problem so that it CAN do what is needed.

Caps is a great way to solve not having BOLD too :)

Lessons from ancient history‚Ä¶.

The way IBM mainframe operating systems handle this is by making it possible to (almost!) seamlessly access files from any mounted file system.

So mainframe-native data sets (case insensitive names; stored in catalogs, not folders; probably EBCDIC content, not ASCII) are in one set of file systems while UNIX files are in others.

Imagine that as as single tag on an open statement. (DSNAME for native, PATH for UNIX, if you really want to know the actual keywords).

And, if the UNIX file system is mounted remotely, there is no need to explicitly upload its files at all (@baronRK‚Äôs starting scenario).

File system neutrality. The best of both worlds!?

Why can't the name (a label, a tag) be anything.  What you are asking for also is deep tags.
Where the Tag itself has a label, and deeper data.

Apple (1)
- Fruit (1.1)

- Appreciation (1.3)

In fact tags should be able to graph to other tags (nodes).  It's all statistical.

Even then the key question is is it worth describing? It's quite an effort after all. I guess in your case, in a team that would help synchronize the knowledge about the system between team members, so to a certain depth it's worth it, at least for the parts that need to be understood by more than one person.

"Unavoidable bugs" - (so long ago that I can't find any reference to it online), IBM used to talk about the 5000 year bug. That's a bug that would take your team 5000 years of continuous testing to find.
And it doesn't matter how big your QA team is - for every team size there is always at least one 5000-year bug.
But , when you launch your product and there are a million downloads a day, some poor user is going to hit that bug in the first 48 hours.

You 'might' be reading too much into everything.

It's simple, I've tracked more bugs and features than anyone you know.   I'l stand on that statement.  Do you have any better examples?

not just our own software, remember, we track entire systems for other companies as well.  Software, Hardware, Device and product dev, etc.

Literally, hundreds of thousands of tasks across different projects each described and discussed and reduced to their cost in time, and problems.  People like to think they know, but we have hard data.  We know for example that our bug ratio is always under 10%, often less than 5%.  Our counter parts on similar projects, have bug ratios inverted at 200%!  Meaning, for every feature, there are 2 blody bugs!  Insane.

When you say 'biased' - to what?  It's just data.  If anything, you thinking you know the nature of your own bugs, or your friend's, is biased to your assumption you can remember what is what, and selective memory, and every other bias humans have.    I simply tag things with words like #StateMachine after a programmer tells me 'yeah, ultimately the bug was a State Machine bug.'  If we had a system in place that tracked the state in simple terms, the bug would not have happened.  not much more to it.

And let me be a little harsher here.  Truly compare this.  Have you ever shiped a product without obvious bugs?
[truly, asking]

I have, many times.  Try making a video game that gets burned into a cartridge, or software that gets released and can't be updated.  Or software that runs in Slot machines, for years, never turning off or being reset.  Again, I have.  I've architected and built product that ship literally 100s of thousands of unites each week, nonstop.  Bugs?  We don't need to stink'n bugs! LOL

Today, almost no one ships bug-free software.  And software has become slow, bloated, and compartmentalized to try to avoid bugs.  

You may not like the way I push you here, but I'll come to the table with data, where is yours?

LOL no, no table coming, as I'm totally not wasting my time on it, so you'll just have to take my word for my stats. *Have I ever?* Yes. It's just a matter of personal QA level and familiarity with the problem.

I understood that tag in the context of "what we could have done to prevent the bug" as "we could draw and analyze state charts". Misunderstood?

For a solid counter-example - take Red [issue tracker](https://github.com/red/red/issues?q=is%3Aissue). It has quite a lot of bugs missing - those that appear on early development stages, but otherwise may serve as an example where state charts would mostly waste more time that they could save. Again, mostly - but not always. And on this stage of development, not on pre-release QA, where priorities may shift, and we'll be talking not about any bugs, but post-production bugs.

I think you answered my question though. Websites and some games are often easy to look at as state machines, and as a result you might be dealing with state machines much more often, which explains the data. You could of course say that every program is a state machine and thus 100% of bugs can be labeled with that tag, but then the tag would be of zero value :)

You just waved your hand again, and said nothing.
[I'm going to keep being harsh with you here, because you keep waving your hand]

So, what are these programs I'm not accounting for that don't have State Machines as their number 1 form of bug?

Let's review again 'things I've made' (let alone tracked for others):

- 8 bit, 16 bit, and 32 bit games
- Original game machines (do keep in mind, I helped make the Sony PlayStation, and the first Set box in history C= CDTV, also the Dreamcast, X32, etc.)
- Dozens of Slot Machines, including being the first person in history to design a slot machine built on Windows! And it never crashed.
- We also were the team that built Media Edition for Windows, literally, they brought us in to fix their bugs.
- Media tools
- Firmware for dozens of hardware devices (again, not allowed to crash).
- Libraries, APIS and frameworks for dozens of companies.
- AI for military
- Black ox AI for massive multiplayer video games
- blah 
- blah 
- blah

But your just going to wave your hand again right?
More importantly, what ratio of all products do they represent?

It may be worth reminding ourselves of Manny Lehman's laws of software evolution, and their distinction between "E-type" and "S-type" programs. If your experience is mainly in E-types, then you may have little intuition for the issues involved in S-type development, and vice versa. That may affect your take on bugs.

> State machines would not help at all.

You're hypothesizing Boris.

We all have our own experiences as limitations on what we know and can use. Ki's experience is deep and wide. I don't know what other projects you've worked on, which would be good to share so we can find common ground and perhaps see why our views differ. You may recall that Prolific is *all about* tracking tasks, and learning from that data is an important aspect. And that's only the last 15 years of him doing it in full view. I'll appeal to another authority here, Pieter Hintjens. In particular, iMatix's Libero code generator. But much of his work was about collaboration, which is facilitated by design. I don't care *who* has the best stats, I just want them.

You noted Red as an example of something that couldn't be done by designing the SM (State Machine) first. `Parse` is, itself, implemented as an FSM, correct? And while it isn't bug free, it's one of the most powerful elements in Red, complex, and quite robust. Are there other areas in Red that *could* have used an FSM as part of their core design, even if only to inform the implementation? I think so. Do we want to do that at a granular level all the way down? I don't think so, but that's from my experience of not having great FSM or other tools that make it easy and natural. If you started someone out that way, it might seem perfectly normal to them, and then we can see what produces better results.

> Even then the key question is is it worth describing?

When work on the new roadmap begins, should we build things like the current codebase was done, or do you think that there might be a better way? You've learned a lot about the deep core of Red, but it was a huge amount of work, right? How can we make it easier for others to contribute effectively in the future? Helping them understand the design seems important. It won't happen by accident. It has to be a goal and a task.

So the answer to your question should always be `Yes`. But we're mostly of a generation that flies by the seat of our pants; and largely gets away with it. We can say "I couldn't have written so much code or built so much if I had to stop and design things first." or "I'm doing exploratory development, so the design would just be wasted when I reach a point where something unforseen comes up." I know I'm guilty of that. Far more than I care to admit. And there *are* two sides to things, because a state machine isn't the right tool to help design a dialect...or is it? Again, we don't know. DiaGrammar was a first step down that path. But maybe, just maybe, design time would have paid for itself and then some.

We do need tools to make sure design is *perceived* to add value for programmers. Because even if it truly adds value, and I think it does, we prefer to write code all by ourselves and keep design aspects floating around in our heads. How is that working out? All our caches fail at some point, unless you live an unbalanced life to keep it filled. I've done that too. I've also played with FSM implementations that seemed huge compared to just writing simple code, so I'd go with code. But there's a big difference in that code shows you *how* it's doing something, not *what* it's doing. Somewhere there's a balance.

Boris - indeed, there is a strong difference between attacking the person (calling someone a victim = idiot) you don't see it that way? 

For example, I genuinely appreciate the amazing talent here, and yours as well very much.  We can disagree and debate and even be heated or passionate, and still not disparage anyone (although it can feel that way).

Small note about 'Ad hominem - this is often misunderstood.  It does not mean you can't attack someone as an idiot.  Rather, it means very specifically that you are saying their opinion or reasons on something are wrong BECAUSE they are an idiot.

I mention to point out, I think you are most impressive, and thus, also worth my time, and thus, more so, worth debating with to learn how we see things differently, including calling into question each step of any logic.

So, 'back on topic? ' - see, this is the topic to me.  Ultimately I'm in this thread on crappy Gitter to discuss how to make RED better, and Gitter better, etc.  Step one, get programmers to see the problem in the first place.

Lehman's laws - Yup, I ref that in the docs I wrote on this 15 years ago (I'm working on a Proj Management book as well)

Of note - when Carl and I would first talk about REBOL (actually back when it is was LAVA, and I was writing MIDAS (much like REBOL in some ways) we literally talked in terms of FSM.  I decided I needed to write my own language in 1990 to faster dev products.  It is one reason we did things in 90 days as opposed to the 1.2 years of most comp products.

Other Greg - Indeed, and just think about how many programmers on GitHub are writing the exact same crap over and over and over.

In our project management system (just imagine if Google Cal, Drobox, Jira, and Notion had a baby) we have a bug where the Badges on the Chat service update with new messages ( a panel on the left, sort of like MS Teams), but the Chat thread itself does not update.

This is a State Machine bug! Either way.  Something is not firing off, or checking the STATE!

And for one reason or another, does not matter, it should be thought of as a failed state, and it should have warned the programmer this could happen.

We can follow this real task to gether and learn what REALLY is happening.  It could be a Typo, it could be bad logic, etc. 
 Here is a screenshot of the task

You can see the Doer (Bolek) and Celeste and Edgar are watching this, they might be able to help fix this as well.
We will then discuss in a chat thread attached to the task, and we can add links, images, etc.

This brings up an important point.

How a programmer thinks of a bug, and how I believe a bug should be thought of, is not the same thing.

Programmers (myself included when I'm wearing that hat)  tend to be literally, and task-oriented, and bottom up.

I tend to first ask: what is the goal?  Since we often get caught too caught up with the path we walk.  Perhaps we should not be walking a given path in the first place.

So, my point is, if we had the infrastructure for a smart StateMachine in the first place, then little magical tools could be watching what you are doing, building a flowchart, and popping out conditions that should not be possible and telling you about them! #Dependanies

One of the problems with defining bugs is that you have to first know what the true expected behavior is. In a messy and ever-changing world, that true expected behavior may be ill-defined and subject to change over time.

Many years ago, I did some desigh work for a travel company who wanted to break into the exotic locations weddings market (eg they fly you to a sunset beach, and you take your vows while riding elephants).

Their brief requirements document said something like ("10% discount if at least one of the partners is under 21; 15% discount if at least one of them is over 65")

We immediately flooded them with questions - which I can sum up in this one question: "what is the discount if three 18 year olds are marrying three 70 year olds in a group marriage?"

Turns out they hadn't thought about "mixed age" partners or polyamorous marriages with more than two partners.

Which is a pity, because booking a fake marriage could have been a very cheap way for grandparents to take their grandkids on a luxury. vacation. But would allowing that have been a bug, given the initial vagueness of the spec?

[18:40:18](#1KF10Dag1kDprXyU6gZgIJzhSU3Iq5kygknuNl_hi60) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
I agree with @dsunanda that the real issue is what is defined. We can say there isn't enough time to specify everything in detail, we lack information, etc. But that just shifts the behavior spec to "undefined". That leads to more and varied bugs, and wasted time. 

To @riprwwa's question, I've never built an entire system this way, only parts of them. I think that's part of the answer. You don't try to define an entire system, top down, as an FSM. What you do is build *parts* as FSMs (and other tools to increase reliability and predictability), and assemble those. So you can view a system process as a series of black boxes, then drill down into those to see their inner processes, down to the last turtle ("Turtles all the way down" reference).

Various approaches apply. SMs by definition respond to events to change state or trigger actions, so an eventing system is needed. Actions based on events may send other events, which likely leads to a messaging queue of some kind. Now we're into channels, and one model that uses those is FRP (Functional Reactive Programming). Another is TBP (Flow-Based Programming). State has to be stored and perhaps distributed or persisted, feedback may be needed, along with backpressure mechanisms. 

All that to say that state machines don't exist in a vacuum. Or, rather, in isolation. I imagine James Dyson and his team use them. :^)

Bug Taxonomy

Boris - Indeed, cool list, and YES, let's actually review a few together.  

Sunanda - LOVE this example.  Gab (and others on my team) decided to architect what we call a club code.  We knew marketing would keep having us come up with discounts, etc.  So I decided to just build a top-down system that could do ANYTHING.  We did.  We used this in multiple systems too, and should black box it and sell it to others.  Summed up, Marketing can build a bunch of rules 'First 100 people to sign up get subscriptions free for 1 year' and we encode that like a Smart Contract, and it runs as a batch with everything else.  Problem solved.  Also, a giant state machine of course.

@BaronRK Never underestimate the power of Marketing to dream up pricing schemes that break existing systems  - and all known laws of logic.

I once spent three days in a basement with  a couple of guys from SAP. SAP wanted a vacation pricing model so they could break into the industry.

The two guys started out with high confidence. Between them they had done pricing models for Crude Oil and Newsprint - said each was top of the range in terms of pricing complexity.

At the end of the three days, they were reduced to saying that SAP would be good on the backend - if our existing pricing model tells them the final price, they can produce the customer invoice.

The existing pricing model was really 50 years of tweaks to accommodate Marketing's latest pipe dream.

Typical Marketing request: please implement live by Friday: "If you book on any of the next 10 Thursdays for a flight departing between 02:00 and 11:45 on any of the next 20 weekends (except Xmas week), departing from (airport list); and your party size is less than 6 (not counting infants, but including juniors) and your return flight is within 8 to 15 days of your departure. And your destination is Madrid or anywhere outside the EU, and you have a customer loyalty card (or are paying by AmEx), you are eligible for a 50% discount on use of the Executive lounge".

In the 80s, we added multiplayer, to games which only 4% of people used.

Resizing the Red app on the new machine will (randomly, but very quickly) freeze the Lenovo. And that's completely frozen;  no cursor movement, no ctrl+alt+del. Only way forward is to cycle the power.

Luckily (!?) this only happens when running from the Red console. Running the "compiled" .exe works fine. And I can still develop on the olde worlde laptop.

I now seem to have accidentally caused the problem to no longer manifest.

Dunno what I did. But one bug I fixed this morning had to do with font sizes. The UI has many rich-text fields (think of a table) all of which should resize at the same time. But a rounding bug in my resizing of fonts left some of them 1 point bigger than the others, sonetimes.

I fixed that UI bug  and now - seemingly! - no more total system crashes. In fact, I can now resize so fast that I see the transient blank bands that hiiamboris recently reported: https://github.com/red/red/issues/5221

- Required Apple SPECIAL USB cable #FAIL
- Failed to copy at first, hard to tell if MS or iPhone bug #FAIL
- Had to copy folders THREE TIMES over each other to get a match on total file sizes from both devices. #FAIL}

Please  note, this is not how many fails I logged over the past 3 days, I average about 12-15 logged failures I encounter every single day.  That does not include software in development by our team, since that is logged in tasks (features/bugs).

I did just realise that Chrome can lock up from time to time, just Chrome.  But it tends to recover, so I assume massive memory moves or garbage collection is happening.  It verages 2GB to 6GB as I tend to have many heavy tabs open.

Although I have to ask - does it make sense to make it a datatype (in Redbol sense)? If you can adapt the majority of Red actions to this datatype, then maybe (although still worth considering a port! instead - hopefully ports will be able to dispatch actions into their methods). If not, then I would just make it an object exposing some DSL/API to interact with.

I've gone from considering CSV being a table format, to be a line based command/argument format with highly varying line lengths. It fits well with how python can, using standard libraries, read CSV files line by line, split each line up and act on each line. It makes for an easy way to transfer commands, modes and data between languages, where object structures don't really fit.

I've started storing some data in this way in REBOL too, though this required writing a proper reader and writer that can hold up to storing kilobytes or megabytes of data per line.

You could do this with a more custom and more efficient format, but anything that can produce CSV files (because sometimes you need to build or look at that data in Excel) is convenient, and most languages can read and parse CSV files line by line and act on each line.

In short, I guess I'd want the python method for understanding CSV in REBOL and derivatives, if it's ever going to be built in.

For a number of years, two separate times in my life, I sang with Christmas Caroling groups. I would sometimes mention in segues that we could consider expressing kindness and compassion all year long, sometimes with a serious tone, and sometimes with a funny tag-line. At one event I spoke quite a bit and an audience member caught me between sets and asked about my denomination (I also used to make non-demoninational jokes ("It means we don't have any money.")) and I said I didn't attend. He nodded knowingly and said "Oh, so you're a traveling pastor." A friend in the group had to explain to me how that worked. :^) I am legally ordained, however, and have conducted a couple marriage ceremonies for friends and family.

What does Ray Kurzweil say about the AI Singularity?

Ray Kurzweil believes that the AI Singularity is an event in which artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, leading to a period of rapid technological advancement. He believes that this event will occur in the early 21st century, and that it will have profound implications for humanity. Kurzweil believes that the Singularity will bring about a new era of abundance, creativity, and prosperity, and that it will ultimately lead to the end of death and disease.

I do appreciate the value a powerful neural network can bring about. It will be the best tool ever existed. However there's an abyss between a ML network and an AI that can pass a Turing test.

Of course. I just don't want to use that software. :^) Like I didn't want to use the software or printed docs from the 90s when people could make 3D-ish UIs and got WYSIWYG. 

Oh, wait...we're still there. 

One of my favorite products is the Hot Logic food warmer.  You just plug it in. It changes temp over time (rises at first to heat, then goes down), but you have no control over that, other than to unplug and replug it. I also like lava lamp's simplicity, but the particles do get small if they are on for a long time. :^)

I hate all the mini data/plugs with a passion. Can't tell them apart at a glance (e.g. micro USB vs USB C), and I probably do the micros 3 times myself, because the damn things never line up right.

`This code creates a server-side program to manage a cafe-style computer service, where customers can log in and out of computers, and pay for their usage. The code includes functions to register new computers, monitor customer usage, record logins and logouts, filter results by hostname, and update the status of each computer. The code also includes an event handler to capture the close window event, which pops up a confirmation window to ask the user if they are sure they want to quit.`

We need a term for something, and since I don't have the term, I will need to describe it (categorise this in terms of George Orwells thought crime, if you don't have a word for it, you can't think of 'it;)

In all the responses about Secure Media (thumb drives, etc.) we can see there is now a product, or service, thus no solution!

Why?

Because most people focus on tasks, solving a thing by thinking the result concluded if a feature or task is accomplished.

Whereas, I'm interested in Goals, or working backwards from a solution.

In my mind, most people are forwards thinking (MBTI Sensing, Packing, Task).  I'm interested in backwards thinking (MBTI Intuitive, Mapping, Goal).

MBTI is probably the closest thing we have to describe this.

We're terribly complicating this.  This is not about 'Windows' or 'Mac'  this is about a simple USB thumbrive being encrypted, and able to be unlocked and read easily between an Android and a Windows machine.

New topic

= Gaming ChatGPT =

It seems to me, a better thing to be doing (as a programmer) right now is writing WORSE code, and letting ChatGPT fix it for you.

Let me explain...

- Write code in the most direct boring banal way possible, because...
- ChatGPT can have an easier time understanding your code (nothing tricky in it) and can do a better job rewriting it.

It frees the programmer from trying to solve complex things, or worse, TRYING to write elegant code.

I also tend to like USB-C, for two things mainly: it replaces every other mini-USB port, and those were all just unbelievably stupid pieces of engineering, and that it's symmetric. 

However is it a 100% winner? It's size is both a benefit (fits small devices) and a drawback (durability). And while port is standard, I hear controllers that are using it are so varied that replacing one is a problem. You're saying people should be demanding it, but first they should be demanding USB-C ports on PCs and laptops (else where to stick it?), and these products have a lifecycle that is at least a few years, so I'm sure we'll be there eventually but you can't rush it. Personally though I have no idea why I would ever want to encrypt a flash drive :) So I also don't know what issues you're having with the VeraCrypt, but given the general state of software of today I can probably imagine...

Chinese companies have not accumulated the inefficiencies of big corps, so they *can* target niche markets and be profitable. Alas, they also often have no incentive in lasting long, so most of the time they just scam their buyers :) Still, it's like a more decentralized way of conquering the market, which I approve.

I will disagree here with you. First, because the toaster does not *understand* the code. It only copies and permutes what it had seen others write, so beyond trivial stuff it's useless. Second, and more importantly, because by building *anything* we actually *build ourselves*. This is our main quest, not the code itself, which is a mere byproduct. By building things lousily we do not advance on our path, we only throw ourselves back. We become the lousiness.

Well, thank you for asking...

This is one of those strange things where Website making tools should be super easy.  It's $%!@%# layout at the end of the day.

Yes, every tool out there sucks so BAD I truly can't understand it, each one worse than the other.  WordPress is unusable, and when you add plug-ins to it they become a different nightmare.  

Things like WebFlow and Wix etc. hold your hand so much you can do what you actually want to do.

I've studied about a dozen deeply (and forced myself to really use them).

I can tell you it ultimately comes down to this, you want a tool that:

- Compatibility - Works perfectly on Mobile and Desktop (I'm talking about the output, not the editor).
- Templates - Has really simple templates for common things (top menu, footer,  colours, skins, etc.)
- Templates/Carousel - Specifically has a carousel feature!  And many templates for that.  This is the one I find almost all sights use to hook you in and charge you.
- Animated (everything can move, text, buttons, fade-ins, etc.)
- CMS - Hooks up to 3rd party CMS.
- CMS/Video - Specifically handles Video well (and can pull from 
- Deployment - Can run on your own server (thus subscription free)

I challenge you to show me one that does even half of these in a single system.

Now, that all being said, I keep asking people which system is best given they all suck, what I get back from the hoard is Tilda.   That doesn't mean I will like it, but this is the one I plan to torture myself with next.

The spirit accompanies people which have been around the Amiga, even without the Amiga. It will be forever with them, in their lives. Amiga developers have learned how important memory usage and correct handling of pointers is. On my PC, 30 years after, some programs lose control of themself if I run out of disk space and memory. Multiple times files have been corrupted or deleted because of this.

Update: I just realized they will be replacing https://gitter.im with https://app.gitter.im which is a fork of their Element that was supposed to be more compatible with gitter. 
- This is the only client that allows me to log in via GitHub so far. So desktop clients are out of question for now, and it only works in "modern" browsers, so not in PaleMoon. 
- It's a complete mess there: hundreds of rooms with no order to them, mixed together with alleged PM requests from hundreds of users, and a lot of duplicates of all that. 
- Invite-only rooms are still there but with history erased. 
- Threads UI is more similar to gitter here and [super convenient](https://i.gyazo.com/557564c86d7850766bb20ee74f17d595.png). 
- Threaded messages posted from this client appear in other matrix clients but not in gitter itself (won't be a problem after switch). 
- Just as in other clients, no support for images embedded into markdown. 
- As expected, no activity pane.

It's Share Time (I rant, now it is your chance to rant at me)

1. I've been tracking every single Chat thread feature from every system I can find that is worth of mention. (given the geeks in this room, no I will not be including C64 Geo Chat from 1988, unless you can prove it had some amazing feature!)

2. I'm designing finally the NEW chat thread for our Mobile App for Prolific.

3. After 15+ years, this is my best functional design (meaning, after we build it, we might refine it more)

Now, what are you seeing here?

- You always know what project you're in (that would be the same as this RED group here on Gitter I guess).
- You always see what service you're in (that would be same as this one forum thread 'chit-chat'.  Except in  my world, that I designed, ANYTHING can have a thread attached to it, a task, a meeting, a file, a wiki, and a forum itself clearly)
- Because this sample thread is from an event from a calendar, we give you a little 'useful' important hints.  Given the space, what do you see? Event name, when, and relative time, which allows us to use much less words (or if you're a Grammar Nazi, FEWER words!) since we can then (together) paint a fast pic.  you also know 3 people are in the meeting, and a very thin red line around the middle person tells you they have not accepted this meeting.  
- The real magic is the [...] - did we miss something?  Tap on that and learn way more about this meeting, all the details, or change stuff.  Send yourself a reminder 10min before meeting on your phone, etc.

Next up the messages themselves.

- Nice clear avatar
- Your status (orange = online, black = offline)
- Relatively post date
- What is that purple tag?  Well, it means this message was or is tagged private (red) and also publically (blue).  Thus, purple! (if you are not clear what I mean on this, or anything, just ask)
- Read state toggle
- And what do we see?  Individual [...] so you can modify this one message personally.  for example, I might tag messages from Sunanda with #Insightful.

Find Duplicates takes Volume A and B, or even A and A, and tells you if it found file 1 in mor than one place, but in the same Volume path.

TBH I don't understand what he needs, nor I ever wanted anything like this :) He started with a "common need", which for the majority of people is just the ability to pin a few folders to the desktop. Then he wants to find specific duplicated file (single file or all files?). What does it even mean "specifically the data"? You can't index by data. You can index by file size, by hash if you're looking for binary identity, by a common set of words (but that's gonna be very fuzzy and very very slow comparison).

`Everything` seems like it could come really close. Perhaps he could pay the author for a new feature. The idea being that when you select one file in the search list, all dupes are highlighted or shown in another list. That does mean hashing, but if you've already narrowed the list by name, then check the size, it can be faster. Cache those results for future use. 

I just found https://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/command_line_interface/ which seems to allow exporting the results. Do that for the heavy lifting of file finding, and then write an app just to do the bits BaronRK (Reichart) wants. Still no full automation, though, as you can't trigger actions when a file is selected in the Everything result list. Have to at least macro the steps.

Boris - you are wonderfully procrustean
(most of what you wrote is niether what I said, or even implied)

Let's only speak in goals.  Perhap that will help here:

Goal 1.  I have a thumbdrive filled with stuff.  I simply want to know for fact I have all that stuf already archived somewhere.  In the simplest path, I should be able to do this with but a single click, and instantly 'Yes, all of this is archived, you can delete this thumbdrive.'

Nothing does.

Goal 2. I have a file, I want to know it lineage.  Meaning, I want to know things like:

- Does it match to goal 1
- Do I have this exact file match (the data, which is the file itself, not sure why that was confusing to you), and also the meta data, which would be things like the file name, the date it was created, etc.
- I then want the Meta Meta, which to me means I want to know where the file came from.  A C64, or  from the FAT32 file system.  
- If I had my way, it would store so much Meta Meta that one could reconstruct a copyprotected on an Apple II. as easily as one unzips a folder.

Why would I suggest most people want this?

Because almost every one 'eventually' wants to search for something in a way that these features would be needed to answer that criteria.

Goal 3. Genetics.  Once you have all this info, you have a good chance of building (reverse engineering) the genetics of a file.  Think of it as recoonstructing a GitHub repository and change log.  you can ask about a file, and find where it probobly belongs.  Consider a source file, an image, or a sound file, and you are tying to pieace it together (file it) in the right place.  This would allow that as well.

Does this paint a better picture for you?

1. 'So among a few millions of files it finds a million that is out of date.'

Ok, let's address this one concept.

You have a File 'A' - and you ask if it exists somewhere and the answer is 'Yes, this is backed up.  but the just the date is different.'

One feature I want is to 'add' the date of 'A' to the the Meta Meta log of the file in the archive.  
That is the reason for Meta Meta, to store anything I can about a given file.

Same applies to millions fo files.  We simply need batch options.

2. Does it show it to you as a list? 

List, spreadsheet, etc. Even badges on thumbnails.

https://www.tagspaces.org/ does some of this (I'm talking with the creator of this.  Note, he gets what I'm saying 100%)

3. Does it copy it somewhere else? What do you expect next?

I expect smart features to ensure the Meta Meta is updated.

Mostly this is going to be as I said, add to the Meta Meta log of each file.
As long as we have the file, and the meta, then the meta meta becomes the all powerful.

4. 'Goal 1 is solved simply by locating a folder in your backup named after this thumbdrive, and copying all contents over it.'

Why? The problem as presented is to ensure data is backed up. By overwriting older files you do just that.

> that on mac, the folder is replaced completely

If Mac really degraded that far, one can always use any of the numerous file managers that provide all the options for copying. Or write a batch/script for one-click backup with one's custom preferences. 

And to clarify I'm not saying Windows Explorer or it's Mac twin are good ways to copy files. These tools are file browsers, not file managers. They're somewhat good for displaying content, but that's it. Plus they accumulate more and more bugs in every new OS release. In fact, I advise to stay away from any big corp tool for they're by default bloated, buggy and limited, and for others reasons.

> notebook is overflowed with millions of small files (thanks to git projects) and the system still tries to index them

I wrote a R2/View front end for a Pick system as a first step to dumping the entire Pick DB over a serial connection to a PC and rewriting the full application as an R2/View app running on a MySQL DB.

Several people - including me - have more-or-less complete archives of the site; so re-hosting the content is possible.

Rewriting rebol.org's CGI library from scratch would be a good idea in this case (unlike rewriting `sudo` in Rust Ì†ΩÌ∏â) and can be done today actually. I have functional Red webserver that can run Red CGI scripts and even if the IO interface will change, it would require just adapting the webserver for the new interface, not the CGI scripts. So it's doable. Another possibility is to use Rebol3, I want to port my webserver to R3 anyway, to make it "multiplatform".

Hosting .... Carl was using the same people who hosted rebol.com - and they provided rock-solid excellent support. But not cheap.

USD 10 .... I assume we are in the period in which Carl could reclaim a lapse name. If not (or if he doesn't) a five-letter .org name with a good ttrack record may be snapped up very fast for a lot of money.

Library .... Does the R+ world need 1200+ scripts without much clue as to whether they work R2, R3 or Red? Maybe a better gift to the world would be a good subset of the 1200, each clearly certified for what environments they work.

A bit of an advertisement from me, for those with at least minimum crypto knowledge.

Recently some guys started a project for [airdrop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airdrop_%28cryptocurrency%29) automation: [AirdropFactory](https://airdropfactory.io/). I've been around for enough time to know this a real project from real players, not scammers. Their niche is they come into the crypto project's airdrop campaign and bring ton of *real* users, but without any effort on those users part.

Works like this: you just buy subscription, during that time they participate in airdrop activities, and once the tokens get eventually dropped (can easily be half a year later) you get access to your burner wallet with the coins and can sell or hodl them. So apart from subscribing and eventually selling no effort is needed.

Subscription cost is small, just $85/year if you register with [my referral link which gives you a 15% discount](https://account.airdropfactory.io/?promo=73f4ff60f58bedc2e40faa163a96bf2e6f61b5b0c657b15b75d0b8da14c4d9ce). I'll see your email though, don't use private ones. Yield they predict to be in $200-$2000 range (I'd lean towards the lesser on bear market).

At the moment they finally got their site working properly, so I thought I'd share it with the outer circles. There still may be some glitches on th site, e.g. `http:` version doesn't work AFAIK, use `https:` one, and some parts of the site may not be translated. Card payments probably won't work yet from outside as well, only crypto.

Where would be the best place to discuss the MPRESS packer software used in the building of RED?   The reason I ask is that my workplace does not allow RED to be installed on our machines due to the virus detection software (Forticlient) not allowing MPRESS due to it being FREE and being used in many scenarios to obfuscate Malware.  So, this becomes an issue for RED the language and RED coded applications not working in larger companies.  This is also apparently the case for Windows Defender.

[20:28:19](#VBZdqdPpHIaQHoze8Ie1Svyo6bQrHIbFNCT0HQ_Asac) <Brock>:
"Though I'm not personally certain of the precise policies or which if any compression applications are currently supported to allow for reduced code size, I can only guess that a free, unsupported application like MPRESS is likely to have been used by many malicious code developers over the last few years.  This makes it highly likely that Microsoft has lost interest in attempting to determine whether such code is malicious or not and may now simply assume that it might be.

If I were a developer, I'd be looking for a more currently supported compression application if I truly required this.  I'd also ensure that I was following other security best practices of digitally signing my applications and installers using a certificate assigned to me, since this is the best way to ensure that my code is seen by Microsoft (and many other) security products as associated with myself and safe for Microsoft's customers to use."

IIRC Red is compressed by UPX, not MPRESS. Though maybe things have changed. I do pack my binaries with MPRESS, but that's my personal choice.

It's a known issue affecting a lot of software, where Red is no exception. Key thing to understand is that AV mafia uses their tools as a means of racket. See for example my recent post above on how ridiculous their "heuristics" get.

I recall the team was discussing automatic signing but before, but ran into unresolved complications. greggirwin (Gregg Irwin) or @dockimbel may remember more.

It's a known issue affecting a lot of software, where [Red is no exception](https://portapps.io/doc/faq/#antivirus-complains-about-the-wrapper). Key thing to understand is that AV mafia uses their tools as a means of racket. See for example my recent post above on how ridiculous their "heuristics" get.

More thorough review you can find [on the wiki](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/[NOTE]-Anti-virus-false-positives), while [here](https://github.com/red/red/issues/3263#issuecomment-602061941) you can see that disabling compression often only increases the number of false positives.

I recall the team was discussing automatic signing but before, but ran into unresolved complications. greggirwin (Gregg Irwin) or @dockimbel may remember more.

You may probably periodically ask your AV vendor to whitelist given Red binary when you badly need an update. Or better, stop supporting the racket and choose more independent AV vendors. Not sure what else can be done. It's just the world we live in.

Do you mean `forskip`? @dockimbel hasn't decided if it's worth it. Some feel it's more important for `forall` to be native for speed, though I think the same model as in R2 could be used as natives. The REP for am extended `loop` interface has never been formally considered AFAIK.

yes, software degrades very fast.

* hardware, OS and browser wars - I guess it's a good thing thing to have healthy competition. HW/OS wars - I'm all in. Browsers - that's rigged, Chrome vs Firefox, it's like naZi ruSSia vs Ukraine, totally unfair war.

Reason this degradation manifests so much in software is that you can't measure the value of software, because it is copied. Cheapness of a copy diverted huge money flows into it, so there appeared a perfect opportunity to tap into these flows. As this opportunity realized itself over the years we all reaped the results. 

For comparison you can't do the same in logistics, because nobody will buy veggies at 100x price, so logistics almost does not exhibit degradation symptoms.

I agree with the concept that hiiamboris explained, even if one assumes the 98/2 ratio is incorrect. It is one of the things that frustrates me most about modern society. Governments are especially terrible in this regard. They provide some value to society (infrastructure, defense, etc.), but there is immense waste in doing so. And these governments generally get into areas they have no business being in.

But I don't necessarily see it as an issue of "humanity as a whole" gaining from it. I, like many of the founding fathers of the United States, think personal freedom is extremely high on the list. If pursuing your personal interests doesn't benefit humanity, but also doesn't detract from it, that's perfectly OK.

Someone may be a terrible artist, but if it brings them joy, then that is a benefit in itself.

Yes, the "enslaving" part seems to be a growing concern.

I was thinking about this, and I think there are also a lot of jobs that might not move society ahead, but are required to maintain society. Farmers, markets where those items can be sold, doctors/dentists, etc. All these jobs are definitely more than 2% of the population.

San Francisco city government is a great example of waste. Because of their self-imposed red tape which they hoped would promote their own narrow progressive vision of reality, trying to build a single public toilet cost them $1.3 MILLION US dollars. This could have been done in another US city for about 1% or 2% of the cost in about 10% of the time.

Farmers who? I believe we're long ready to automate tractor drivers, they're just not a priority. Agricultural decision making doesn't have to be done individually by everyone, but can be centralized. Market vendors are more of a habit than a need: even in our wild country there are self-service checkouts all around. Doctors are basically prescription vending machines 95% of the time (and very incompetent at that), and the need and ability to get them out of our way is widely understood (you probably know all those IBM Watson and alikes). Not to mention majority of them are not there to cure, but to ensure the global pharmacy reign, unwittingly.

As for why a toilet can cost $1.3M (wow :D), reason is always the same: the more the cost is, the more of it lands into bureaucrats pockets, so they're always in for expensive projects as a way to launder the budget. One of the examples of how parasites tap into the money flow. But no matter how many people come together, in the economy where people are forced to work, if you remove them from one flow they will just end up on another, so it's only shuffling things around but not solving the core issue.

Here is an example container which has object for earch datatype:


```
datatypes-management: [table-bob! make object! [
    pick: func [
        "Returns the series value at a given index" 
        /ref1
        series [series! port! bitset! pair! any-point! tuple! money! date! time! event!] 
        index [scalar! any-string! any-word! block! logic! time!] 
        return: [any-type!]
    ][]
    find: func [
        {Returns the series where a value is found, or NONE} 
        series [series! bitset! typeset! port! map! none!] 
        value [any-type!] {Typesets and datatypes can be used to search by datatype} 
        /part "Limit the length of the search" 
        length [number! series!] 
        /only {Treat series and typeset value arguments as single values} 
        /case "Perform a case-sensitive search" 
        /same {Use "same?" as comparator} 
        /any "TBD: Use * and ? wildcards in string searches" 
        /with "TBD: Use custom wildcards in place of * and ?" 
        wild [string!] 
        /skip "Treat the series as fixed size records" 
        size [integer!] 
        /last "Find the last occurrence of value, from the tail" 
        /reverse {Find the last occurrence of value, from the current index} 
        /tail {Return the tail of the match found, rather than the head} 
        /match "Match at current index only"
    ][]
    index?: func [][]
    at: func [
        "Returns a series at a given index" 
        series [series! port!] 
        index [integer! pair!] 
        return: [series! port!]
    ][]
] flat! make object! [

```

The dispatcher code could be:

```
pick: func [
  series 
  index
  /ref1
  /ref2
] [

   apply :datatypes-management/(type-of series)/pick  context? 'series

```

`/REF1` and `/REF2` are collected from the various verions of `PICK` in each datatype.

Adding new functionality and datatypes management to the standard functions. So you can FIND a value in a column of in a TABLE, have the WORDS-OF a picture, SELECT a ROW on a table based in internal indexes and so on.
I am experimenting into extending existing functions so they would call the coresponding ACTION of the datatype, like Red/Rebol do with the standard ones.

It should not change the existing working. What is needed is an name based interface when the second argument is context. Actually APPLY has no mode based on arg names but only positional ones and at least a native one is needed for such applications and speed.

I do not know the reason why this working has not been implemented but this working is essential for have speed in apply using contexts with different shapes (but equal words). Otherwhise the overhead is strong.
I'll try to work with what we have and from time to time I will come back here making may complains! :D

You can't reuse an object. You must copy it and init. The reason is that is you call a function with apply using the premade object, and during its execution it calls other functions which back call it, then the object will be initialized again. The only solution is to copy the object for each call and init it, like creating new stack frame and passing arguments but at mezzanite level, which is way slower than using low level code. 
In strict loops on table rows, where functions are iterated thousand times the difference will be evident. I still have not tested it because it seems a normal conclusion but I will do some tests and report.

I should say it's not reentrant in its basic form. This is the kind of thing where you have to weigh the costs of extra complexity. e.g. you could create a pool (stack) of objects which are used by reentrant calls, but then you run up against general code versus what your system requires.

Red's designer (Nenad Rakocevic) here. Let me try to shed some light on this fundamental topic.

Red & Rebol are data formats first, before being programming languages. This has many implications and is overlooked by most newcomers. Rebol documentation did not stress this fact enough. Red will try to do a better job at that.

What does that mean in practice?

In almost all non-Lisp languages, you go from a textual representation of your source code to an AST (abstract syntax tree) which is compiled/interpreted. That is not the case in Red/Rebol, the text representation is LOADed as Red data and put in a block.
"The truth is that...there is no spoon!" or rather "there is no code", as everything is data. This has deep implications. For example, every function body is just a block of data, that you can manipulate as any other data, and you can do so at any time. There is no point in time where your "source code" becomes "code". It is, and remains, data.

To get the correct mental picture of what happens when you evaluate such a test function, do not try to apply your knowledge of execution models from other languages to Red/Rebol. That will just block you from learning and understanding Red.

Always keep in mind that the lines of "code" you are reading are just "data structures", nothing else.

Strictly speaking there are no "variables" in Red. Words are first-class values, with their own datatype, and can refer to another value in a given context (we call that binding). You can think of it as a simple link between the word and a given value. Therefore a: "string" just makes the word a refer to the literal string which follows it, nothing else.

in Red, unlike other languages, the variable (word) is assigned to the data and not the other way around. https://helpin.red/Seriesnavigation.html

This is why "scoping" and "variables" make no sense in Red.

Scopes form chains, but contexts are completely independent of one another; they are essentially namespaces ("semantic fields" if you wish). Rebol just tries to fake them, cloaking itself as a thing that "kinda-sorta looks like an Algol-family language with functions, lexical scope and conventional while loops and stuff".



[16:04:23](#4G5voty8Ccupa-mM4XWp2gB0kRkSYrSKcL6AS_O9Ldk) <dislux-hapfyl>:
Variables, in turn, are memory slots that can hold content that varies (hense the name) over time. Words are not variables - the only thing that can change in them is their binding, but that's completely implicit. They are not memory slots, they are the content of slots (value slots, that is) with an extra pointer to another value.

Function contexts only exist when the function is under evaluation, so the error there is legitimate, as the function is not running when [x] is evaluated. Function's context are allocated on the stack (objects and closures ones are on the heap), so you need to call the function to have its context available. Though the function does not need to be the currently called one, just somewhere in the call chain. When the context is available, then any word bound to that function's context can be evaluated. When the function is not in the call stack anymore, its context becomes unavailable. Closures will not have this limitation, but they will have a memory and performance overhead. For the record, Rebol2 puts function contexts on the heap, while Rebol3 puts them on the stack (like Red).

Other nice old notes, from Carl Sassenrath, on the goals of Rebol (which all Redbol langs should honor): 

- "It is also a language for representing data and metadata. It provides a consistent architecture for computation, storage, and exchange of information."
- It is a messaging language designed for the semantic exchange of information between people and machines. (can't find his exact quote, so this is my possible paraphrasing)

Justine's work is amazing, but has nothing to do with Red AFAIK. I stand in awe, and it's really cool what she does.

On Meta, Kaj is an old Reboler and a great guy. People have different goals, and that's OK. My hope is that we can all support each other and share what is shareable to move us all forward faster than we can alone.

What is the blinkenlights doing?

[23:42:23](#u9oct4uJu6gTTwdWDy3lc50-FeVoSMVSr016HiWs9dQ) <dislux-hapfyl>:
 Blinkenlights is a command line debugger that focuses on visualizing how software changes memory. It's able to emulate statically linked i8086 and x86_64-pc-linux-gnu programs on the Linux, Mac, Windows, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD platforms.

Computers once had operator panels that provided an intimate overview of the machine's internal state at any given moment. The blinking lights would communicate the personality of each piece of software. Since our minds are great at spotting patterns, developers would intuitively understand based on which way the LEDs were flashing, if a program was sorting data, collating, caught in an infinite loop, etc. This is an aspect of the computing experience that modern machines haven't done a good job at recreating, until now.

First quick note. Because this url returns the content type, you can do `j-data: load https://randomuser.me/api/` directly. Just saves a step.

To traverse the data, you need to know how it's structured. In this case `print` hides some details that are important. Use `print mold` to see the difference. When I saw the data, here's what I did to sleuth it out.
```
>> type? j-data/results
== block!
>> type? j-data/results/1
== map!
>> words-of j-data/results/1
== [gender name location email login dob registered phone cell id picture nat]
>> j-data/results/1/nat
== "UA"
```
So the key is that you get back a block (JSON array) of records, each of which is a map. If you get more than one back, you can then iterate over those, rather than using the fixed index of 1 for the first record.

Thinking recently about upcoming Red nodes / gc enhancements, and also Red/System, I have remembered the old Tao Intent technology. Back at the time, if was found innovative, and Amiga Technologies wanted to base Next gen AmigaOS on Intent. Initially, to my dislike, as they diverted from basing Amiga OS on Neutrino QNX. Inent was more like a Red - translating to intermediate language, then to native code.

So, I was curious about why the company collapsed, and found the following article. Pity having cool tech does not automatically mean a product sustainability. Having some Amiga friends here - do you guys remember?

I've been using Element (previously Riot) for maybe 10 years or so. All this time they were removing useful features and breaking the other ones, never fixing a damn thing Ì†æÌ¥¶Ì†ºÌøª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è To me the existence of their software is a living proof of the [infinite monkey theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) - in a sense that for monkeys to finish the product will take infinite time, and 10 years is like zero on that scale :)

So to answer "what motivates?" I would guess they're trying to focus their monkey on a narrower set of features in hopes that it will then squeeze infinity somewhat and bring their end goal closer. Alas, that's not how infinities work Ì†æÌ¥∑Ì†ºÌøª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

But speaking of "search in all rooms", matrix never even had it to start with.

Well, I have found this post on Facebook:

"I contracted work at AOL in the WinAMP subsidiary, working on WinAMP Cloud as one of its two engineers during 2012.
I was hired because I had experience writing code in Erlang (there is a joke that there are 50 Erlang programmers in the world, and 49 of them work at Ericsson. I now work at Ericsson, irony: not doing Erlang). 
I watched the entire team implode at the end of 2012, with e.g. the lead Windows Client developer going off to work at Spotify. 
It was the ONLY job I have ever resigned from, due to the extreme toxicity and stress of the work environment. 
I mention this, because since the whole division imploded in 2012, the rights for WinAMP have floated around, and have finally wound up in the hands of some really incompetent people, who decided to "open source" it by not only putting it under a very conflicted license, but uploading THE ENTIRE BUILD TREE TO GITHUB, INCLUDING PROPRIETARY LICENSED CODE (e.g. Dolby's official AC-3 CODEC code!).
I am just sitting back, munching popcorn, and watching the fireworks. 
https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp
I worked on this code, and can say, yes, it's 100% real, and should not have been uploaded in this state"

Guys, you should really watch new RSC2 branch, which seems to be a complete compiler rewrite and also different segmentation for R/S - nodes, GC, more granular compiler / linker. Your crashes are going to be a moot point then. There are going to be a new crashes probably though, at least initially. Ì†ΩÌπÇ

I have an idea to use Red scripting to directly assemble machine code text and generate programs across CPUs and operating systems. 

The same code, only need to modify the configuration items, can generate 64-bit programs on 32-bit machines. 

In this way, Red bypasses the 32-bit limit of REBOL. Truly implement full-stack development from operating hardware to advanced scripting.

 Is this possible?

I am not sure it works that way. Red is imo not 32 bit because of Rebol dependency. Rebol just compiles code to R/S and generstes the backend code. Recently, there is a big rewrite effort of the backend, watch the rsc2 branch. It gets rid of the Rebol, makes Red self hosted. It also seems to make backend code more granular, so better suited for future optimisations.

isqwy (Â∞òÂ¢®): That's what Red does today, as far as machine language generation and being full stack.  But the interpreter still has to run on something. That is, you have to implement the interpreter, and for that to be consistent for testing, it also needs to be 64-bit.

LLMs taking our jobs? ..... I asked LLAMA-3.1 to produce a code snippet in Red. After rejecting what it produced twice (both times contained **obvious** syntax errors), this is what resulted.

**Me: suggest a short, advanced, informative post for the Red Language discussion forum**

LLAMA-3.1: When using `reduce` to compute series, it can be useful to preserve context information between iterations. Here's an example of how you can use `context` to accumulate values in a series:

```
 nums: [1 2 3]
 total-context: [
    func [context /local n] [
        reduce adddo  n [for i [i = index!] nums i * index!]
    ]
]

result: reduce take total-context make context! [9]
```

I may be writing code by hand for a while longer :)

Using the same request but with ChatGPT and Rebol actually works:

Rebol's seamless treatment of code as data and data as code makes it a uniquely powerful language. This paradigm simplifies metaprogramming and enables elegant problem-solving approaches that are often cumbersome in other languages.

Here‚Äôs a quick example demonstrating dynamic code generation:

```rebol
data: [1 2 3]
operation: 'append

generate-code: func [data operation][
    reduce [operation 'result data]
]

result: copy []
do generate-code data operation
print result
This flexibility allows you to dynamically build, modify, and execute logic based on runtime needs, without the typical boilerplate.

The first ‚Äì maybe the greatest ‚Äì influence was Lisp. The thing that was brilliant about Lisp was it used exactly the same representation for programs and data. Originally, the idea was that you would have programs that could act on themselves as data, and do interesting things. ‚Ä¶ Another influence was Rebol. Rebol‚Äôs a more modern language, but with some very similar ideas to Lisp, in that it‚Äôs all built upon a representation of data which is then executable as programs.

After this phase, you will need to compile and start it. Obfuscated into a PNG, there is a script that once compiled will run a remote control code and you are fucked!

I recently installed Dart/Flutter, then had to add Android Studio and Update Visual Studio for mobile and desktop targets. After downloading 10GB (yes, really) of tooling, and making Flutter Doctor happy with the install, I built the example Flutter app. An incrementing button, effectively Hello World.

In the app dir was 550M of output. 45M flutter runtime for the 1M Windows app, and lots of other stuff. The web and Windows versions built and ran fine. Haven't tried more yet.

This is, of course, comparing apples to oranges. I hope that somewhere between our current simplicity and the rest of the world's bloat, there is a level that lets people do lots of useful work with Red, without a massive size or complexity increase.

I'd argue a bit with their point about reducing language complexity to a minimum though. I think any real world system we're modeling has a level of complexity inherent to it and unavoidable. If language runtime doesn't model parts of that system's complexity, it is up to the user then to model it. Shifting responsibility is what often really happens between language, lib and app developers.

Smalltalk/Pharo syntax is minimal - they boast "it fits on a postcard", but the entire virtual machine is extensive, with thousands of classes. So learning the language is one thing, but using it to accomplish something in the real world - quite different. I like Smalltalk/Pharo immersive programming environment with system browser, finder, debugger displaying the source code and VM bytecode and all the other tools. As to deployment of an applicaton - well, it's not that easy.
About the language complexity - the underlying paradigm of Smalltalk is message passing - this is what Alan Kay had in mind when coined the term OOP. Each object is thought of as a separate computer; it accepts messages and decides how to respond to them. May be this what the call "minimal" - the cognitive load to understand the workings of the entire system.

GiuseppeChillemi (GiuseppeChillemi):  76 years ago ...... ‚ÄúAs soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn‚Äôt as easy to get programs right as we had thought.  Debugging had to be discovered.  I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.‚Äù (Maurice Wilkes, Memoirs of a Computer Pioneer, 1949).

And talking of debugging....

Can I make a plea for something like Rebol's PROTECT and PROTECT-SYSTEM ?

It would save idiots like me a hour of debugging for typos like this (the problem was deely masked at the accidental overwriting of NEXT broke a lot of other code):

```
get in system/words 'next
== make action! [[
    "Returns a series at the next index"    ;; right now, all is well....

f: func [tags /local tag][
   foreach next tags [print tag]    ;; should be foreach tag tags ....
   ]

 f [1 2 3]
none
none
none

get in system/words 'next
== 3                      ;; basically the console session is destroyed

You probably don't understand what is in the article. VS Code is still free.. Their extensions are not open and it was stated, that they should not be used in other forks of the VS Code.

Cursor is a fork of VS Code, but is not open and is not free. So is really MS the bad guy, when they don't want Cursor to use their extensions, which were not licensed to be used freely?
