Of course :) You just need to build IO version of Red and then clone my [Castr repo](https://gitlab.com/rebolek/castr/) and check out the `open-url` branch. I‚Äôll merge it into the master branch soon to make it easier.

Testing the client:

* you can use `%open-url.red` that provides two functions, async `open-url` and blocking `read-url`. This is the old version and the script would be removed soon.
* or, recommended, use `%http-scheme.red` that provides two schemes: `http` and `https`. I‚Äôm porting the `open-url` code to the scheme.
* however, `read-url` is the only function that handles the redirection. It‚Äôs understandable, as redirection is technically two or more connections done in series and I‚Äôm not sure right now if it can be properly implemented in an async matter. Probably yes but I need to think about it.
* it seems, that `read http://example.com` currently uses the `simple-io` version of http(s), so you need to use `port: open http://example.org wait port close port`.
* response data are either returned on `close` event or available in `port/extra/response`. On `close` only the content is returned, in `port/extra/response` you have everything including the headers.
* If you want to modify the request (use another method than `GET`, additional headers, or some data), you can use `insert port data`, but that‚Äôs WIP and it‚Äôs not fully supported yet. `open-url` gives you finer control currently.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Hi Rebolek. Thanks for the pointer. I have question towards schemes. I can see repetitive task of assigning an `awake` function (handler?). Is tere planned to be some kind of template, in other words - working with pure TCP ports, will I have to provide a handler each time?

I do remember Carl stating, that introducing async networking is also about trade-offs. Because in the past, we mostly opened the port, added it to the wait-list, waited on that list for events, dispatched events, inserted into port, copy from the port, closed the port. 

I can see more of manual work is going to be needed, so just curious, if we can have kind of template or schemes, whic could make it easier? 

E.g. opening a http:// port, would already provide the awake function? Is that correct?

That‚Äôs what the `awake` function does. For HTTP there‚Äôs of course need for some preprocessing (creating a request) and postprocessing (parsing a response).
You can also use `open`, `insert`, `close`, etc. But that would work for small data only, once you hit some limit, you need to deal with repeated reading in the awake function.

Is there going to be some syntactic sugar on the top of it? I think yes, but that needs to be decided how it‚Äôs going to look. And I think we need more experience with async IO in Red to decide what the best model is for Red.

Question time: I‚Äôve been re-reading some Carl's post, and in [this one](http://www.rebol.net/r3blogs/0130.html) he writes:

> So, the HTTP port is doing whatever "magic decoding" it needs to do in order to create the result we need.

> Using this approach, we can say that maybe we can allow read of an HTTP port to return properly decoded text. In such a case, read is returning a string datatype not a binary datatype. That may be fine.

> Of course, we want to determine how far to go with that model. For example, if I read an image using HTTP, do we get an image returned from read? I'd say no. In that case it may return a byte stream, because we may not want the image fully decoded at this point. For example, if it is JPEG, we might want to write it as a JPG file.

My HTTP scheme currently decodes even images. I understand his reasoning but there are few problems with his approach.

* We can‚Äôt offload the decoing to `load` completely. HTTP scheme needs to decode at least textual data from binary. But if we have a good MIME decoder, then it can be used both in HTTP scheme and in `load`

* To use the MIME decoder, we must provide it with a proper MIME type. That‚Äôs available in headers, but I guess we agree that `read http://example.org` should return just the content, not the headers. HTTP scheme provides headers in `port/extra/response/header`, so you *can* get the proper type, it‚Äôs just a bit unconfortable. Another possibilty is to return converted data on `read` and bytestream on `read/binary`. Franky, I‚Äôm not sure what is the best way.

So, what are your thoughts?

Using `read` and `read/binary` has another problem though. It‚Äôs usable only with (blocking) `read`. If you want to do it manually, with `open`, `copy`, `close`, there‚Äôs no way to pass the `/binary` refinement. One idea is to trigger the conversion with the `close` action, so until you `close` the port, you would have raw data, after `close`the converted data. But maybe it‚Äôs getting too confusing?

OK, let me try to explain it. You have two metods for reading from web: `read` and `open/copy/close`.

Currently, when data are read from web, they are converted on the `close` event. So `read` always returns converted data.

I'm thinking on adding a special mode, where `read/binary` would return the raw byte stream, while `read` would still do the conversion.

Of course, no disagreement here. The question is, if `read` should return binary! also, or if it should convert to a proper type. You prefer binary, but what about HTML? Should it return binary too, or convert it to text? And JSON? Shoult it return binary, raw JSON, or convert it to map!?

@qtxie is the plan to support `open/binary` as in R2?

I agree that `read` should handle redirection.

There is a clear distinction between `read` and `load`. `Read` is for text and raw binary data. `Load` is for values. `Read/as` controls only the text encoding. `Load/as` controls codec application. For files and URLs, via extension and MIME type respectively, the codec can be determined. But if you're loading a string or binary data, `/as` is your responsibility. In the future, I imagine we'll see a `load` wrapper or module that can sniff for formats, but that will be an optional piece, as it's a special case.

> `Read/as` controls only the text encoding.

I have few points here. If you look at the source, `/as` is currently ignored. There‚Äôs no support for other codepages than UTF-8 (but that can be fixed easily, as I have support for ten most used encodings and others can be added easily). For HTTP, `/as` isn‚Äôt required, as the encoding is given in the headers. But it makes sense for overriding header encoding if it‚Äôs wrong. That happens sometimes.

Good point on `open/binary`. That probably would be required to support `read/binary` in custom schemes (like HTTP). But I‚Äôm not against a different mechanism of arg passing.

The more I think about it, the more I think that Carl‚Äôs proposal is the way to go, but there are still some unresolved points.

* `read/binary` would return raw binary data. I guess we all agree on that. Does that include status line and headers?
* `read` would return text (I guess we agree that only the content), but what about other types? If we exclude headers, we lose MIME type info. Other option is to return `block!`/`map!`/`object!`/`whatever!` with all info but that would complicate some things, like for example instead of writing `print read http://www.example.org` you would need to write something like `print select read http://www.example.org 'data` (oh, the horror!). This is the method I prefer, but I‚Äôm open to suggestions. We need to pass the metadata somehow.

In opinion,
Simple `read http://example.com` should return the content by handling basic MIME types:

All `text/*` converts to `string!` (including `text/csv`)
`application/json` to `map!`
`image/[bmp,png,jpg,gif]` to `image!` (supported image codecs)
Non determined MIME types (or if Content-Type header is not present) then it returns `binary!`

So for the user it is easy to check the return value is `string!` or not and decide what to do.

`read/binary` should always return `binary!` regardless of the MIME type.

For headers and other metadata, `read/info` can be used (should it make OPTIONS request?), it can return a block with headers and other metadata (should it also return the content as well?)

@greggirwin Has it been an internal discussion or is it publicly available? I ask because I have had this discussion too with myself about its use on other functions and I have not ended to a definitive conclusion.  Sometimes mapping options to refinement is good, sometimes it is better to have them in a block as keywords, sometimes as dialect, and some other times as single object.  No definitive answer here.

@GiuseppeChillemi You need to compile console from the IO branch, I expect you know how to do it.

* Then clone my [CASTR repo](https://gitlab.com/rebolek/castr/). Everything you need is in the `%rbdt` directory.

* Open the Red IO console twice in the `%rbdt` directory.

* In first console run the server: `do %rs-server.red`

* In second console, run the client and try to send a command:

```
>> do %rs-client.red
>> write rbdt://localhost [ping]
( ...some debug omitted... )
== [pong]
```

If you really see `[pong]` as an output, congratulation, your server is running!

The protocol uses (compressed) Redbin for communication, so you're able to not send just commands, but all Red data structures such as blocks, objects, etc with their binding.

The server uses `parse` to process input from client so to use your own commands, you need to write your own rules and load them (see lines 225 and 227 in `%rs-server.red`: `load-rules rules %rules-giuseppe.red`).

The are two rulesets included: `%rules-users.red` which provides user and session handling (singup, login, sessions, tokens, expiration, ...) and `%rules-polls.red` which is simple polling application, an example how to use the server.

Rules itself are simple dialect. It's a standard Red file, so it starts with a header followed by some directives and pairs of rule names and rules.

Here's how the `ping` command would look as separate ruleset (`ping` is builtin command):
```
Red[]

name ping ; REQUIRED: name of the ruleset
extern reply ; REQUIRED: `reply` is where the server's reply is stored (this should be simplified later, but now you need to add it)

ping: [ ; rule name - currently not used, but it's intended for auto-documentation purposes
    'ping    ; the actual command expected from the client
    (reply: 'pong)    ; reply that the client will recive from the server when the rule is matched
]
```

That's it. Feel free to ask me further questions. It's a work in progress so some things may change (as the `extern` directive described above) though not the protocol format itself. And if it does, it's versioned, so future server versions would understand older clients.

[8:37:52](#kExddhYk4nfUJofgmaSauJGVM1PF1gqFrFSmqAhZse0) <rebolek (Boleslav B≈ôezovsk√Ω)>:
When sending the command, keep in mind https://github.com/red/red/issues/4996 - `parse` is case sensitive in `block!` mode, so the command must be `[ping]`, not `[PING]`.

[8:45:38](#WBucrAzjeLhQrMk12OEk609q_twqu4i7QziSNyK3u-A) <rebolek (Boleslav B≈ôezovsk√Ω)>:
Other directives in the rulesets are:
* `import file!` - works as `#import` in Red, but imported file is bound to ruleset only, not available globally
* `import word! from ruleset` - because imported files are kept in separate contexts and you may need a function from a different context, there's `import`. An example is `import match-token from users` in the `%rules-polls.red` ruleset, which imports the function `match-token` that checks if user is logged in based on provided token.

The main differences from Rebol/Services is that RBDT is just a communication protocol. It doesn't deal with encryption (and relies on TLS instead), authentication and other stuff, however, that can be build on the top of it, for example the `rs-server` has support for authentication.

Also, with it's redbin support, it's much more tightly integrated with Red. You can use text (molded data) as well and it makes sense in a lot of cases, the overhead of redbin makes no sense with commands like `ping`, which should be transferred as plain text instead. But that needs some logic to determine which format to use.

You don't have to bother with `git` if you don't want to. Just download the zipped repo content from IO branch from: https://github.com/red/red/archive/refs/heads/IO.zip

 * You don't have to bother with `git` if you don't want to. Just download the zipped repo content from IO branch from: https://github.com/red/red/archive/refs/heads/IO.zip

Put a Rebol executable in the top folder of the repo and use the compilation command-line.

rebolek (Boleslav B≈ôezovsk√Ω): I remember your framework has a function to replace a parameter with its value in an URL but I don't remind which is.

Was IO branch merged in Red 0.6.5?

[22:34:02](#1kxadUFuXD8ujFiTwyb2vMPTsIQTSYSyGzqF8HHjDNg) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
No. The change to 0.6.5 was because of the syntax swap between maps and construction syntax.

dockimbel: if the migration to 64bit is in early stages, why not complenting I/O, so we have a wonderful instrument to play with until 64 bit is completed?

0.6.5. got merged into the new IO2 branch, hence I expect some potential new developments towards the IO happening in there ....

I have just seen. We have also one about Table in View

Any ideas how should work a directory port? Currently there is just an atomic action which collects all directory files. Do we want to support opening a directory and reading file names in chunks? What about resolving additional file info in such a case to avoid additional requests?

[14:43:48](#RbsCx6YSpH0MlrUnIp7vSbnD_6sHOECeMJ6wg6v8Jlo) <hiiamboris>:
reading in chunks makes sense for network listings

[20:25:31](#B37eB7OoOrA6TupsQ6IcMuBiWM-5DubOu1bPcj-VYgM) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
A file system is a hierarchical data store. We should have an interface that allows easy reading of fs-info, metadata, pattern matching (globbing), and limits and/or pagnination.

For many use cases, an indexing system is valuable. There are cases where we access unknown stores (generic file browsers), but most systems use conventions of some kind to organize data. Something to keep in mind for the layers that will use the lower level ports.

[20:27:01](#I7Wckq62Rkqd1Pd9-N8CTTZpyOgovRIma5mYE7SQVMw) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
Identifying what the upper layers do helps nail down what the lower layers should provide.

The low level system also could provide a search handler (object/port) which would cache the data it already has. So if you requested the filenames and the OS provides file sizes and dates together with filenames, it would keep all the data but only give you what you ask. Then you may query some additional data without extra FS reads.

So if you requested the filenames and the OS provides file sizes and dates together with filenames, it would keep all the data but only give you what you ask. Then you may query some additional data without extra FS reads as long as you keep the handle.

IIRc, for the metadata, we used the `query` in R2?

[13:20:32](#cYw_FeeLC0kt83QI4euX_CIdtp5UPxCVRhLGYxdeLds) <greggirwin (Gregg Irwin)>:
And `get-modes` for file attributes like `read-only`.
