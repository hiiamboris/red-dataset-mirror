*Comment by DocKimbel:* I don\'t think your question is adequate for SO,
as it\'s meant to be obsolete very quickly, and could be repeated *ad
infinitum* every month\... SO help says: *\"You should only ask
practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you
face.\"* You should better ask your question on the Red ML or chat room
at
[gitter.im/red/red](http://gitter.im/red/red){rel="nofollow noreferrer"}

*Comment by Giuseppe Chillemi:* Thanks Doc, it is first time using SO,
failing the first time in something should be a good way to success :-)

*Comment by DocKimbel:* No worries, see you in Red channels. ;-)
