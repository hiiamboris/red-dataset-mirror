over

mouse\
Mouse cursor passing over a face. This event is produced once when the
mouse enters the face and once when it exits. If flags facet contains
allâ€‘over flag, then all intermediary events are produced too.

There is no symetric event ? How do I know mouse is not over anymore ?

In rebol there was
[http://www.rebol.com/how-to/feel.html](http://www.rebol.com/how-to/feel.html){rel="nofollow noreferrer"}
but this syntax doesn\'t exist anymore in Red or I am mistaken ?

        view layout [
            box "A Box" forest feel [
                over: func [face act pos] [print [act pos]]
            ]
        ]

No symetric event is needed as you can use the `event/away?` flag to
check if the `over` event is exiting the face area. See
[https://doc.red-lang.org/en/view.html#\_event_datatype](https://doc.red-lang.org/en/view.html#_event_datatype){rel="nofollow noreferrer"}

`feel` in Rebol/VID is just a keyword for listing event handlers, it\'s
not needed in Red/VID, as event handlers are first-class citizens. So in
Red/VID, you would write it:

    view [box "A Box" forest on-over [print [event/offset event/away?]]]
