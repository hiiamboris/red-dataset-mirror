Use `difference` function for that:

    >> difference now 10-Nov-2017/15:00:00
    == 145:19:24

The same way as for any other date value:

    >> d: difference now 10-Nov-2017/15:00:00
    >> d/minute
    == 21

Alternatively, you can use `pick` to avoid setting the intermediary date
to a word:

    >> pick (difference now 10-Nov-2017/15:00:00) 2  ; Red and Rebol2/3
    == 21
    >> pick (difference now 10-Nov-2017/15:00:00) 'minute ; Rebol3, not yet implemented in Red
    == 21
