*Comment by user310291:* It\'s in TITLE and tag didn\'t you see ? RED
language [red-lang.org](http://red-lang.org){rel="nofollow noreferrer"}

*Comment by user310291:* \@lurker is it you who flagged for close ?!

*Comment by lurker:* \"Red\" is a pretty generic term and I didn\'t
recognize it as a language. Thanks for updating to be specific.

*Comment by Darek NÄ™dza:* Works with `base` (and probably more) instead
of `button`.

*Comment by Gregg Irwin:* Image support in the `button` style is
preliminary (they are native widgets and require extra support for
this). Please submit a ticket at
[github.com/red/red/issues](https://github.com/red/red/issues){rel="nofollow noreferrer"}
for this, and work around it using the `base` style for now.

*Comment by nickkoro:* Ahem, I already filled the ticket for you after
asking on Reds gitter. Here it is:
