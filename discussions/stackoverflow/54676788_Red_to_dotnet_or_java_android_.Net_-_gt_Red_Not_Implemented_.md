Please read the [official
news](https://www.red-lang.org/2018/04/sneak-peek-at-red-on-android.html){rel="nofollow noreferrer"}
before raising such questions (or rather consider to use Gitter
[community
chat](https://gitter.im/red/red/welcome){rel="nofollow noreferrer"}).

Android bridge is currently developed in a private branch and will go
public in [0.7.1
release](https://trello.com/b/FlQ6pzdB/red-tasks-overview){rel="nofollow noreferrer"}.

.NET bridge in the master branch is a PoC; there are [Mono
bridge](https://github.com/iceflow19/red-mono){rel="nofollow noreferrer"}
and [.NET
bindings](https://github.com/koba-yu/LibRedSharp){rel="nofollow noreferrer"}
available from community members, but official CLR support, as far as I
know, is not planned in the near future, and will likely take a high
priority in post-1.0 roadmap.

*Comment by Maciej Łoziński:* I\'m not sure if existence of the answer
somewhere else on the internet is an argument against asking the
question on Stack Overflow.

*Comment by 9214:* For me it indicates that no research effort was
applied - all answers are readily available in public, official
resources (such as Red blog and roadmap) and shouldn\'t be terribly hard
to come by.

*Comment by user310291:* red is not well indexed in google and I\'m not
capable of reading in mind yet ;) but thanks for the links.
