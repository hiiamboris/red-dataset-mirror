### [Text-UI View backend](https://www.red-lang.org/2024/06/text-ui-view-backend.html)

Last year, [qtxie](https://github.com/qtxie) worked on a toy text backend project and submitted a PR for that. After some extra additions and testing recently, it has now been merged even if it is still incomplete, it is usable enough. So, in addition to the shiny GUI backends in Red/View, now we have an old-school [text-based user interfaces (TUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) backend for the View engine!

The new TUI backend has currently a subset of the GUI backends features. Here is an overview:

- [View](https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/view.adoc) [styles](https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/vid.adoc): base, panel, button, check, radio,Â field, text, progress, rich-text, image and text-list.
- [Draw](https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/draw.adoc) commands: text,Â line,Â box, triangle, circle, ellipseÂ (block-based for now).
- [Rich-text](https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/rtd.adoc) supported in Draw.
- Keyboard handling: key-down and key events (which are the same event).
- Mouse handling: disabled by default. Use system/view/platform/mouse-event?: yes to enable it.
- Images support [Truecolor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth#True_color_.2824-bit.29) (24-bit RGB) for image rendering if the terminal supports it, otherwise it falls back to 256 colors.
- Timers supported through /rate facet.
- [Facets](https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/view.adoc#face-object) supported: /offset, /size, /text, /image, /color, /data, /enabled?, /visible?, /selected, /flags, /options, /pane, /rate, /para and /draw.
- Flags supported: password and all-over.
- Frames drawing using squared or rounded corners (
- Limited ANSI escape codes support in /text facet, only [Colors / Graphics Mode](https://gist.github.com/qtxie/a5f31ccba82320ac964c311d768149d4#colors--graphics-mode) codes.
- Uses 256 colors for text. It should works fine on most of the terminals.
- Works on the big-3 platforms (Linux, macOS and Windows10/11).

The pre-built CLI console binaries on our [Download page](https://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html) now have View/VID included by default along with the TUI backend. You can use them to test and play with the TUI code examples here and in the [TUI folder](https://github.com/red/red/tree/master/tests/TUI).

To use the TUI backend in your own compiled code, you need to add the two following options in the Red header block:

```
    Needs:  'View
    Config: [GUI-engine: 'terminal]
```

Here are a few examples, starting with a HelloWorld!:

```
    view [text "Hello TUI World!"]

    Hello TUI World!
```

When view is invoked, an event loop is launched. In order to return back to the console prompt, press the Escape key.

Here is an animated example using a progress bar:

```
    view [
        bar: progress 30% rate 10 on-time [
            face/data: remainder (face/data + 10%) 100%
            info/text: form face/data
            info/font/color: random white
        ]
        info: text 4 font-color white "30%"
    ]
```

This TUI implementation is still not on par with our GUI backends. If some of you are motivated to extend and improve it, contributions are welcome! For example, we did not yet implement menus support. If someone is up to the task, please follow the GUI View menu dialect.

What's next?

We are finishing the work on some significant improvements to the Red and R/S memory management sub-systems and garbage collector that will bring them to the level required for a Red v1.0. Those changes will be released in a bumped 0.6.6 version. Those memory improvements are also needed for completing the work on the async IO branch.

Another version bump will follow with the deprecation of the high-level Red compiler and the addition of a new powerful layer to our Red tower of languages. All those changes are pre-requirements to start our work on 64-bit support.

In the meantime, enjoy this new toy!

### [Red in the real world](https://www.red-lang.org/2024/05/red-in-real-world.html)

We're often asked what Red can be used for, or what apps have been written in Red. Red can be used to write almost anything, but the sparse ecosystem and some missing pieces limit certain use cases. It's used a lot for in-house data processing, custom DSLs, simple GUI apps, and more. We also used it to build Redlake's DiaGrammar product.

When we heard that someone had written a commercial app in Red, we thought that was great news, and we're here to tell you a little about it. Your first question is likely "What is it?" and the second "Where can I get it?". It's an XML processor, and you can find it [here](https://redata.dev/smartxml/). The video on their site goes into detail about use cases and features, so we won't cover that here.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjtu5lDSUa-8xvcGb1SEY-_5v_MbCvS5BYN-SlbBS5Tz8Ww94PKOkHocQ1oiSnYouOYgkItyQtLSo81OPEmgNmMqEX3m8Sow1Kvhdhcs_VdKi-p2083wsWf0azSQ9zW2EZj6YjLrloyxscRJsnlD-lSddO8kXB2eoO5B4Yq8VvySBTBWUHrLZmn_jxRPAY=w640-h392)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjtu5lDSUa-8xvcGb1SEY-_5v_MbCvS5BYN-SlbBS5Tz8Ww94PKOkHocQ1oiSnYouOYgkItyQtLSo81OPEmgNmMqEX3m8Sow1Kvhdhcs_VdKi-p2083wsWf0azSQ9zW2EZj6YjLrloyxscRJsnlD-lSddO8kXB2eoO5B4Yq8VvySBTBWUHrLZmn_jxRPAY)

We asked the author to talk about why they wrote SmartXML why those chose Red for the implementation. Here's what they had to say:

* * *

```
Once I encountered the need to parse multiple XML files. I always thought that parsing tasks were very simple and that I wouldn't encounter any difficulties because there are things like XPath and XSD that, as I was told, solve all possible problems. However, I quickly realized that this was not the case, and some tools/standards only complicate life and are of little use for real-world usage. Thus, my XML parser project was born, which would allow working with real data rather than synthetic examples where XPath and XSD are truly effective.

I chose Red because I was tired of the complexity of 90% of modern languages and the constant breaking changes in many of them. If you were to ask me what language I would choose to start a project with, looking back, I would still choose Red or perhaps try to use Hare (even considering that it's not yet completed) simply because I want to be sure that my solution will work in 10 or even 20 years. Initially, I thought I could finish within half a year, but the project took me many years. Nevertheless, I brought the project to completion.

The main idea behind SmartXML was:

1. To make the parsing process as visual and simple as possible.
2. To abandon the use of XSD schemas, which create more problems than they solve.
3. To rethink XPath by creating a replacement that could work with complex structures.
4. To implement the ability to generate SQL from XML.
5. To implement batch processing of files.
```

* * *

And their advice on development in general:

* * *

```
During the writing process, I had a lot of time to think about what constitutes good code and a good product. Here are some of my thoughts that I realized while working on SmartXML:

1. Standard tools have standard problems. And people very often become hostages of such solutions. Most people prefer the shortest, not the most correct path.

2. The time spent on design is directly proportional to the lifetime of the software product. If you spend 10 years thinking about a problem from different angles, you are more likely to come up with an architecturally beautiful and cohesive solution, but maybe not on the first try. The easiest way to make your application 100-200 times heavier than necessary is not to try to think ahead, but to solve problems as they come.

3. You need to have the strength to admit mistakes. Even if they are design mistakes that require rewriting everything from scratch. Sometimes it is wiser to throw everything away and start over than to continue day by day moving into a dead end.

4. Sometimes it's better to do reengineering of the old instead of inventing something new.

5. A language that allows you to write code quickly solves tactical, not strategic tasks. A huge amount of code written in C 30 years ago will still be relevant in another 30 years. Rebol was designed for 20 years, so most of the code on it will still work with minimal modifications in 30 years.

6. Fighting complexity should take as much time as optimizing algorithms. Simple things are always obvious in hindsight. Writing complex code is always easier than writing simple code. Simple code will always be easier to extend and maintain, and it will always have fewer errors.

7. If you can sacrifice 10% of functionality at the cost of removing 90% of code, you should do it.
```

* * *

This application is a great fit for Red, whose \`parse\` function makes processing data easy (as much as XML processing can be) and clearly defined. The latter aspect is important, and often ignored. Can you write code to get that job done, maybe with regexes in this case? Yes. But can you maintain and extend that code? This is where dialects add enormous value. In a use case like this, being able to represent the data in Red format internally, for processing, also makes your life easier.

We thank the author of SmartXML for taking the time to talk about SmartXML with us, and we're excited to see what others do with it. Tell us about your project!

Happy Reducing!

### [0.6.5: Changelog](https://www.red-lang.org/2024/02/065-changelog.html)

Bumping up the version number was motivated by the breaking syntax change [done recently](https://www.red-lang.org/2024/02/important-change-switching-map-and.html). We do not offer specific builds for a given version number anymore since we provide automatic builds (with builds history) on each new master commit. Though, the changelog for new version number changes will still be provided...and this one is pretty big as it covers about 5000 commits! Hope this will help users who might have missed some changes to catch up.

613 PRs were [merged](https://github.com/red/red/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20created%3A2018-11-22..2024-12-31), 2415 fix commits were pushed, among which 902 are [closing issues](https://github.com/red/red/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20created%3A2018-11-22..2024-12-31%20is%3Aclosed) tracked on Github.

### [Important Change! Switching map and construction syntax.](https://www.red-lang.org/2024/02/important-change-switching-map-and.html)

Sometimes deep changes take a huge amount of code. Sometimes they take a lot of detailed explanation and consideration, leading to long discussions and people taking sides. Rarely does an important syntactic change to a language happen quickly, with universal agreement, simple implementation, *and*Â tools to help update scripts in the wild. Today is one of those rare days.

Admittedly, this *idea*Â has been discussed for a long time. It would surface, people nodded their virtual heads, and it would submerge again. Today it's ready to deploy. Not only that, but Rebol3 is making the same change, so the two languages will still be compatible in this regard.

What is the change?

It's easy to describe. Today, **map!** values use this syntax: **#(...)** and construction syntax (sometimes called *serialized form* or *loadable form*) looks like this: **#\[...]**. Going forward, those syntactic forms will be swapped. Why? The answer is easy. In Redbol langs, blocks do not evaluate by default, you have to **do** or **reduce** them. Parens, on the other hand, *do*Â evaluate by default. Today, maps use paren-like syntax, but they do *not*Â evaluate, while construction syntax uses block-like syntax, but *does*Â evaluate. This is a carryover from Rebol, so the major concession here is that Red and Rebol3 will no longer be compatible with Rebol2's construction syntax.

If you've never heard of construction syntax, there's a nice explanation of it [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27070260/whats-the-purpose-of-datatype-constructor-in-rebol). Red only supports a few values via construction syntax today, all datatype literals, true, false, none, and unset; but eventually it will support much more. If you look at the help for **mold**, you'll see that **/all**Â is TBD (very partially implemented for now), and that's how you create loadable, serialized, data that can safely and easily contain any value (like **redbin**Â but readable by humans). It helps avoid cases where **none** or **true/false**Â may load as words. This is also why **construct** evaluates those specific words (including also **on/off/yes/no**), but not others. When loading untrusted data, we have to strike a balance between ease of use and safety.

What do I have to do?

Not much. There are two tools available, which will convert your scripts automatically. The first is small and simple, showing just how powerful Red is, and leveraging its lexer instrumentation. You can find it [here](https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/utils/migration/map-conv.red)Â (once merged, that branch may go away and the tool will be in the main branch). The second is a more advanced and standalone tool written by @hiiamboris. You can find that [here](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-cli/src/branch/master/mockups/mapconv).

For the simple script it's ***necessary*** that you run it under a current version of Red's lexer. Once the change is in place, running it under the new lexer will make the exact opposite change. Of course, you can compile it into a standalone EXE, or use Boris' app, which is already available.

To run the simple script from a Red console, you can just:

```
  do https://raw.githubusercontent.com/red/red/master/utils/migration/map-conv.red
```

then you can use **help** **map-conv** to see all the available options. By default it runs in preview mode, making no changes, and showing you all the instances it found, which will be changed if you use the **/save** refinement. A copy of each changed file is created with a .saved extension in the same folder. If you don't want them, you can use theÂ **/no-copy**Â refinement.

A word of warning, if you run the conversion tools a second time on the same files, they will convert the data back, because they can't know what you're thinking. On the bright side, this is an effective "undo" feature. Still, it's wise to back up your data before running any tools against them.

Thanks to the power of Red, and these tools, there are already PRs pending for updates to docs and community scripts. But the other thing you can do to help is to let us know when you find things that need to be updated for this change, and especially if you run into any issues when converting your own code.

Conclusion

We know changes like this can be hard, but better now than when there is even more code in the wild that would be affected. If we had been any other language, this long-view improvement might not have happened. Only because Red (and Redbol langs in general) can consume their own code as data and have powerful parse and lexing features, was this change so easy and safe. It's still a code-porting process, and if you run multiple versions of Red you may need to maintain separate versions for a while. The other hard part is retraining your hands and eyes to the new syntax.

Happy Reducing!
