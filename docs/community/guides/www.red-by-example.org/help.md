## Getting started With Red

```
Basically, you need to download the Red system (very small) and use a text editor.
Ungaretti explains possibilities at:
http://helpin.red/There is another editor by Mike Parr at:
http://www.mikeparr.info/redlang.htmlThere are a number of advanced options (e.g. about compiling programs for different 
architectures), and these can be displayed by typing:    red -h    at the Red console.
```

## How to use Red By Example

```
1. if you know the word to search for, you can use the alphanumeric index
   on the INDEX page2. if you are searching for a given functionality, try to browse the index
   per category on the INDEX page3. if you remember part of a word use the browser search function by pressing CTRL+f
   on the INDEX page4. when viewing a words' docs, you can immediately jump to any category it belongs to5. in the INDEX page you can jump to the top of the page from anywhere
```

## Some remarks concerning the examples

```
1. falsey = (any expression evaluating to) none or false2. functions getting wrong arguments generally produce a specific script error3. this page is not intended to be used for Rebol - too many differences4. returned value of a Red expression will appear as is in the text of a word doc5. printed values will appear in blue in the text of a word doc6. extra explanation will appear in green in the tex of a word doc
